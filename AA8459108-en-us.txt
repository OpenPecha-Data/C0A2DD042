The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra Upholding the Roots of Virtu
Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana, near Rājagṛha—an abode for those who practice concentration, an abode for those who do not abide, an abode for those who dwell in emptiness, an abode for those who dwell in signlessness, and an abode for those who dwell in wishlessness. The Blessed One was there together with a great saṅgha of one hundred thousand monks
all of whom talked only little, remained in solitude, and diligently practiced meditative seclusion
At one point the venerable Śāradvatī­putra rose from his meditative seclusion and went before the Blessed One
He bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and then sat to one side
Likewise did the venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana, the venerable Mahākātyāyana, the venerable Mahākauṣṭhila, the venerable Kapphiṇa, the venerable Mahācunda, the venerable Subhūti, the venerable Amogharāja, the venerable Vāṣpa, the venerable Nanda, the venerable Ānanda, the venerable Nandaka, the venerable Kimbhīra, the venerable Upagupta, the venerable Nārada, the venerable Vasiṣṭha, the venerable Mokila, and the venerable Upāli, along with five hundred others who had all gained mastery. They all now rose from their afternoon meditation session and went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side
A party including the venerable Yaśodatta , the venerable Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the venerable Marutpūjita, the venerable Yaśaskāma, the venerable Nandisena, the venerable Nandikāma, and five hundred other monks had been traveling from Śrāvastī where they had spent the rainy season
Now they arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. They also went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side
At that time another party consisting of the bodhisattva great being Ajita and one thousand bodhisattvas like him were likewise on the way from Campā where they had stayed during the rains retreat
When they arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha they also went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side
Traveling at that time were also the bodhisattva great beings Bhadrapāla, Ratnākara , Susārthavāha, Guhagupta, Naradatta, Indradatta, Varuṇa, Brahmādeva, Balabhadra, Viśeṣamati, Vardhamānamati, Amoghadarśin , Susaṃ­prasthita, Suvi­krānta­vikrāmin, Nityo­dyukta, Anikṣiptadhura, Sūryagarbha, Jagatīṃdhara, Dharaṇīṃdhara, Amṛtaṃdhara, Susthitamati, Anantamati , Dṛḍhamati, Trailo­kyavi­krāmin, Anantavikrāmin , Apra­meya­vikrāmin, Vajra­pada­vikrāmin, Amogha­pada­vikrāmin , Acala­pada­vikrāmin, Mahāpratibhāna, Tīkṣṇa­prati­bhāna, Gambhīra­pratibhāna, Ananta­pratibhāna , Aprameya­prati­bhāna, Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, Padmaśrīgarbha, Dharmodgata, Ratnapāṇi, Ratnadhara, Bearer of the Armor for Infinite Eons, Bearer of the Armor of Female Forms, Bearer of the Armor of Male Forms, Bearer of the Armor of the Forms of Sentient Beings, Infinite Leader, Unfathomable Leader , and Leader Destroying All Reference Points. All these bodhisattva great beings had equally donned the armor of activity, an
while they had observed the rains retreat at different locations, they were now gathered in one group, and s
they also arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. Upon their arrival, they went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side
Knowing that this gathering of bodhisattva great beings had assembled, the Blessed One performed a miraculous feat. Thus, by the doing of the Blessed One, all the monks and nuns, as well as all the male and female lay practitioners, who were present near the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by the city of Rājagṛha now approached the grove and the place where the Blessed One was. They came there in order to see the Blessed One, pay him their respect, and offer him their worship. As they arrived before him, they each bowed their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and then sat to one side
At that time Mahākāśyapa was dwelling in the Indra­śailaguha cave on Vaidehaka Mountain together with five hundred monks. They were all forest dwellers, receivers of alms, wearers of refuse rags, wearers of the three Dharma robes, upright dwellers, users of the grass mat, dwellers at the foot of trees, men of few desires, men of contentment, recluses, and wearers of inferior Dharma robes
Now, as the Blessed One effected his miraculous deed, Mahākāśyapa and the five hundred monks disappeared from the Indra­śailaguha cave on Vaidehaka Mountain and emerged at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. Such was the Blessed One’s miraculous activity
Perceiving the venerable Mahākāśyapa’s arrival from afar, the Blessed One said to his monks
“Monks, the elder Mahākāśyapa, who has just arrived, is a forest dweller, a receiver of alms, a wearer of refuse rags, a wearer of the three Dharma robes, a wearer of inferior Dharma robes, a hermit, a man of few desires, a man of contentment, a recluse, an incorruptible one, and a master of the entire Dharma
Monks, in terms of the ascetic practices, all my hearers should be equal or comparable to the monk Mahākāśyapa
Monks, since the monk and wearer of the three Dharma robes, Mahākāśyapa, does not even wish to speak with the gods, what need is there to mention his disinterest in human conversation.
When the Blessed One saw Mahākāśyapa arriving from afar, he said
“Kāśyapa, come here. Be welcome here, Kāśyapa
Ah, the elder Kāśyapa has traveled far to be here
Take this free seat, Kāśyapa.” As soon as the Blessed One had thus given a seat to the elder Kāśyapa, the Blessed One caused a tremor to arise from that seat, so that the entire trichiliocosm quivered, shivered, and trembled; vibrated, quaked, and moved; and rattled, shook, and convulsed. At the same time, the world became engulfed in a great light
Just as a jar of alloyed metal produced in Magadha emits a deep, reverberating sound when it is struck with an iron hammer, so too from the tremor arising from the seat he had just given to the venerable Mahākāśyapa, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the Truly and Completely Awakened One likewise now caused a great sound to reverberate throughout the entire trichiliocosm
The venerable Mahākāśyapa then draped his Dharma robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and, bowing toward the Blessed One, joined his palms in respect
He approached the Blessed One, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet, and said
“Blessed One, you are my teacher, and I am your hearer. Thus, for us hearers it would not be appropriate to enjoy the Dharma robe, alms bowl, cushion, or any other object used by the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha himself
And why is that so
Because, Blessed One, for the entire world including its gods, humans, and demigods these serve as a basis for worship. Nor, Blessed One, shall I use the refuse rags that the Blessed One dons, because such garments serve as a basis for the worship of the Blessed One
“Blessed One, from now on I shall not entertain any thoughts of desire, ill will, or malice. I shall not bring to mind any of the torments of desire, anger, or delusion
Blessed One, in short, for as long as I train, and until I have reached the ground of no more training, I shall place the Blessed One’s refuse rags at the crown of my head
Blessed One, such garments I do not receive for my enjoyment but for the sake of practicing the instructions and advice
Blessed One, as I take up such garments I think myself neither superior nor inferior
Blessed One, I do not think of the refuse rags as something to be worn on the body in the absence of Dharma robes
Blessed One, I do not think of the refuse rags as something that should be touched by unwashed hands
Blessed One, wherever I may be, I will always prostrate to the refuse rags
Blessed One, I do not think of the refuse rags as something that should be touched by any unclean limb
Blessed One, I bear the refuse rags as a basis for worship
Blessed One, that which I bear is what the Blessed One has relinquished and granted
“Apart from the recollection of the buddhas, I do not engage in any attainment for the sake of abiding in some other state
As for the way that I abide, I do not identify earth as earth, water as water, fire as fire, or wind as wind. I do not have any notion of either this world or something that is beyond it. Blessed One, I do not form any notion about anything seen, heard, distinguished, cognized, conceived, or contemplated. Blessed One, the state free from perception, the state of the attainment free from perception, the state of the transcendence of perception, the state of the transcendence of freedom from perception, the state of perception, the state without perception, as well as the state of training and the state of no more training—none of these do I truly perceive
Blessed One, within this state I do not perceive any thus-gone ones, any qualities of the thus-gone ones, nor any state of the thus-gone ones. That is how I abide
“Blessed One, take as an analogy the various names, signs, and designations for open space. Blessed One, in terms of such an application of names, signs, and designations, we may say ‘space’ and so employ a convention, sign, or representation. Blessed One, likewise, just as we may speak of ‘space,’ we may also say ‘the open,’ ‘the empty,’ ‘the void,’ ‘the hollow,’ ‘the essenceless,’ ‘the ungraspable,’ ‘the limitless,’ ‘the unsupported,’ ‘that which cannot be adopted,’ ‘that which cannot be discarded,’ ‘the bodiless,’ ‘the actual,’ ‘the completely pure,’ ‘mid-air,’ ‘the unimpeded,’ ‘the insubstantial,’ ‘what cannot be shown’—or any other such convention. Nevertheless, Blessed One, no name, sign, or representation can be employed to successfully delineate, determine, compare, or distinguish space
Blessed One, wherever we may look, we will not find any color, shape, or objective referent whereby space can be demarcated or contained
“Similarly, Blessed One, we may say ‘the Thus-Gone One,’ ‘the Buddha,’ ‘the Teacher,’ ‘the Refuge,’ ‘the Protector,’ ‘the Support,’ ‘the Guide,’ ‘the Leader,’ ‘the Perfect Leader,’ ‘the Doctor,’ ‘the Healer,’ ‘the Revealer of the Path,’ ‘the Teacher of the Path,’ or make use of some other name or convention. In that way the learned may praise, venerate, extol, laud, and applaud the Blessed One. Yet whichever mundane quality they may express through words and conventions in this way, this will not make me cognize, regard, or perceive the Blessed One
And why is that so
Because, Blessed One, all phenomena are by nature hollow and without essence
“Blessed One, take the analogy of a magician who conjures a universal monarch—a king who has received the royal anointment, is the master of the four divisions of the army, and is in possession of the seven precious treasures
Blessed One, that magically produced monarch may then be engaged in the subjugation of all the beings that inhabit that universe of four continents, and he may succeed in vanquishing that infinite amount of beings
Blessed One, the monarch’s body is distinct, and the bodies of the sentient beings are likewise seen as distinct. However, Blessed One, the magically conjured universal monarch will certainly not be thinking, ‘I shall be the master of this great army! I shall rule this world of four continents!
And the four divisions of the army will certainly also not be thinking, ‘That universal monarch is our leader, so we must follow him!’ And yet they do follow him
“Similarly, Blessed One, that which is the intrinsic nature of phenomena does not exist as a blessed thus-gone one, a hearer, someone training, someone not training, a solitary buddha, or an ordinary being
Blessed One, within the intrinsic nature there is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the thus-gone ones’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the solitary buddhas’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the hearers’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of ordinary beings’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the intrinsic nature of form. Likewise, there is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the intrinsic nature of feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness
Blessed One, within the intrinsic nature, form is empty, form is empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of empty form. Likewise, herein feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are also all empty, they are empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of them as empty. Similarly, herein the thus-gone one is empty, the thus-gone one is empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of the thus-gone one as empty. In the same way, the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone one is empty, the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone one is empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone one as empty
Blessed One, in the same way, there is no hearer either, and no intrinsic nature of the hearer. There is no ordinary being and no intrinsic nature of the ordinary being
“Blessed One, in the analogy of the magically produced universal monarch and his divisions of the army, there is neither any universal emperor nor any divisions of the army
They are not to be found within the illusion itself, the intrinsic nature of the illusion, or within the magician
They are not in earth, not in water, not in fire, not in wind, not in space, and not in consciousness
They are not within the elements of earth, water, fire, wind, or space. Nor are they within the element of consciousness
Blessed One, all phenomena are this way
Blessed One, I do not think about them, I do not produce them, and I do not speak of them
Blessed One, as I am in this way disengaged from desirable qualities, I recollect the qualities of the thus-gone ones
“Blessed One, this is the path, this is the way
The noble sons and daughters who abide upon and have attained this path will not think, ‘I must engage in other trainings. I must search for other teachers. I shall follow other mendicants or brahmins as they teach. That other venerable one knows with insight, sees with vision, and applies the true view with mastery.’ Such thinking is not appropriate
Blessed One, since I have become certain about this, that is how I am
Since I have attained that gateway of the Dharma, that is how I am
This is how all phenomena are: they all share the same nature in terms of their voidness and unborn nature
“Blessed One, I wish to bring my doubts about the Dharma before the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha, an
as the Thus-Gone One has given me the opportunity
I have come here to the Kalandaka­nivāpa from the Indra­śailaguha cave
Blessed One, I am here, and the Blessed One has granted me a seat
When he granted me a seat, this entire trichiliocosm reverberated and the ground trembled and shook in six ways
“Blessed One, this is how I think: The Thus-Gone One is a tremendously great being in possession of the Dharma, the vast Dharma. Without any master, the Thus-Gone One is self-arisen, and yet he follows the way of great compassion. Free of special pride, without any pride, he has granted me a seat. This, I find, is a wonder
“Blessed One, I think of the analogy of a poor man, who has been struggling to maintain the most basic livelihood. That man may toil hard and so end up with a fine home
At that point he may go before a king who has received the royal anointment and is the commander of an army of four divisions—he may go before such a king in order to see him, prostrate before him, pay him respect, and ask him questions
If, when the man arrives, the king then offers him a free seat the man will think
‘I came here to see the king and pay my respects to him. Even an opportunity just to see the king and prostrate before him is rare, let alone the prospects of being able to ask him questions
Still, as soon as I arrived, this monarch who has received the royal anointment granted me a free seat. What a wonder this is!
“Blessed One, you are the king of Dharma, a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, self-arisen and without master. How may I wish what even for hearers and solitary buddhas is hard to achieve and hard to imagine, let alone for the world of gods, humans, and demigods
How is it that have I come here—before the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha—to ask questions on the Dharma, to behold you, to prostrate, and to pay you my respects
Blessed One, this is how I think
I have succeeded in seeing the Thus-Gone One. I have succeeded in prostrating to him. I have succeeded in paying him my respects. I have succeeded in addressing him. I have succeeded in addressing him in full
As I now stand before the Blessed One, he has granted me a free seat. Indeed, my success is of the finest sort
“Blessed One, when the poor man beholds the universal monarch he is filled with wonder, and, Blessed One, I too must marvel. Blessed One, this is how I think
The Thus-Gone One is endowed with great love, great compassion, great joy, and great equanimity. The qualities that the Thus-Gone One possesses are only his, the Teacher’s, and no one else’s. Yet the Thus-Gone One does not think himself special, supreme, or superior. What a wonder this is
I think of how the buddha qualities that belong to the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha are not shared by any hearer or solitary buddha.
The Blessed One then spoke to the venerable Mahākāśyapa
“That is right, Kāśyapa, that is right
Kāśyapa, you are right
Kāśyapa, the thus-gone ones are boundless and endowed with boundless qualities
It is impossible to measure the extent of their generosity, and their transcendent generosity, and so on, through to their insight and their transcendent insight. Their aspiration, their transcendent aspiration, their means, their transcendent means, their activity, their transcendent activity, their liberation, their transcendent liberation, their vision of liberated wisdom, and their vision of transcendent liberated wisdom—these are all immeasurable
“Kāśyapa, four factors pertain to the thus-gone ones’ unequaled wisdom
Due to their possession of those four factors, the thus-gone ones bring forth the lion’s roar in the midst of their retinue
Which are those four
They are the equality of discipline, the equality of absorption, the equality of insight, and the equality of buddha qualities
Kāśyapa, whoever is endowed with this fourfold wisdom of equality is a thus-gone one who proclaims the lion’s roar in the midst of their retinue.
The Blessed One then spoke the following verses
“Buddhas throughout inconceivable worlds, Endowed with the infinite wisdom of buddhahood, Have purified the actions of the mind, And so proclaim the lion’s roar
“In letting the lion’s roar resound, They terrify the extremists, Who when hearing of phenomena’s intrinsic nature Fall into the abyss
“Those harboring the notion of self And the notion of a sentient being— Kāśyapa, such beings I declare To be extremists in terms of this teaching
“Those keeping the notion of an entity And of ‘my self’— Kāśyapa, such beings I declare To be extremists in terms of this teaching
“Those deluded beings Who conceitedly consider themselves disciplined, Concentrated, and learned— Those are extremists, Kāśyapa
“ ‘I am content and have few desires; I remain in solitude And adhere to the simplest of Dharma robes’— Those who think this are extremists, Kāśyapa
“Take the analogy of space: When a hand moves through space, it is unobstructed. Moreover, as for space, It can never be stained by dust
“Likewise, Kāśyapa, those who practice This Dharma that I have taught Will not be stained by the afflictions; It is just as with space and dust, or clouds
“People may offer flowers and incense, Or garlands and ointments to the sky, Yet the sky will not keep track, thinking, ‘Offerings that arise and cease are made to me.
“Space will not be stained, Its nature will not be stained— Its nature is devoid of any essence. To mendicants, so are all empty phenomena
“Space will not be threatened, Nor will it ever be abused— To mendicants, this is how all phenomena are
Like space, they cannot be tarnished by anything. “Mendicants who train well in this Dharma, While also showing others the points of training, Will never develop attachments. These I declare to be well-trained mendicants
“Just as space cannot be blocked by the hand, Nor sullied by dust or smoke, And just as its path cannot be altered, So are mendicants who trust the Dharma accordingly
“Across the cloudless sky The moon travels unhindered, Yet it does so without thinking, ‘I shall illumine this space.’ “Likewise, when, free from agitation, moon-like mendicants Visit the households of benefactors Their minds should be liberated, free from excitement and pride, And unstained by any mundane phenomenon
“Having abandoned pride they thus visit the households, An
once there they speak the Dharma
Having given up desire for pleasures and acquisitions, They live in the world by pure discipline.
The Blessed One then spoke to Mahākāśyapa
“Stand up, Kāśyapa
Stand up and go take your seat
Kāśyapa, whatever doubts you may have about the Dharma, you must bring them before the Thus-Gone One
Kāśyapa, I shall answer your questions and delight your mind.
The venerable Mahākāśyapa then rose from where he had been kneeling, bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and took a place at one side
Once more the Blessed One performed a miraculous act, so that all the monks and nuns as well as all the male and female lay practitioners in Jambudvīpa now came to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. They approached the site where the Blessed One was, and as they arrived, they bowed their heads to the Blessed One’s feet and then sat to one side
Miraculously, the Blessed One next caused all the monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas to enter the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana and
as they entered, this limitless and boundless mass of beings gained insight. The Blessed One then proceeded to perform more miraculous acts
Thereby, from the entire trichiliocosm, the four great kings, King Śakra of the gods, Brahmā, Mahābrahmā, as well as all the divine sons of the heavens of Luminosity, Unlofty, No Hardship, Excellent Vision, and Unexcelled arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha due to the power of the Buddha. As they arrived, they proceeded to the place where the Blessed One was residing. Having bowed their heads to the Blessed One’s feet, they sat to one side
facing the Blessed One with their palms joined in homage
The Blessed One then performed further miraculous acts. Thus, by the power of the Buddha, there now appeared the kings of the nāgas—Sāgara, Anavatapta, Kambaleśvara, Gautama, Nanda , Upananda, Manasvin, Takṣaka, Sundara, and Elapatra—accompanied by a billion other nāgas. They all went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet in homage, and sat to one side
In this way, by the power of the Buddha, such a vast gathering of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners had now come together at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana. Everyone entered the grove and took a place there without any anxiety about one another. Such was the Blessed One’s miraculous activity
The Blessed One now addressed the venerable Maudgalyāyana
“Maudgalyāyana, stand up and prepare a seat for the Thus-Gone One
Seated there, the Thus-Gone One shall deliver the Dharma discourse known as ‘Cutting Through All Doubts.
He will display the activity that fulfills the wishes of all sentient beings
He will deliver a teaching of the Dharma that satisfies all sentient beings
He will reveal the ocean seal that leads all sentient beings to merge with the Dharma
He will explain how to accomplish the activities of all bodhisattva great beings
He will explain the way to cultivate the qualities of the buddhas
He will explain the practices that bring sentient beings to maturity
He will explain how to practice transcendent generosity up until transcendent insight
He will explain the practice of the door to the way of all phenomena
He will show the accomplishment of the lord of all beings
He will show the accomplishment of the activities pertaining to the states of all beings
He will satisfy the four retinues
He will satisfy the retinue of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
He will teach just a fraction of the wisdom that is unhindered and unimpeded with regard to past, present, and future. He will teach just a fraction pertaining to the ripening of karmic action, as well as to activity, aspiration, and wisdom.
The venerable Maudgalyāyana rose from his seat and bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One
He then emanated a seat for the Blessed One that was as large as the world of Brahmā
In the sky above he emanated a courtyard for the Blessed One made of the seven precious substances that was as smooth to the touch as kācalindika fabric. The courtyard was as vast as a thousandfold universe, and it extended for a distance of seven hundred leagues. Surrounding the courtyard were seven fences, seven arches, seven ledges, and seven layers of lattices made of bells and bangles
To its sides he emanated trees of four precious substances: gold, silver, crystal, and beryl
The trees of gold had silver leaves, crystal flowers, and beryl fruits; the trees that were of silver had golden leaves, flowers of beryl, and fruits of crystal; the beryl trees had leaves of gold, flowers of silver, and fruits of crystal; and the crystal trees had leaves of gold, silver flowers, and beryl fruits
Between the trees were ponds filled with water endowed with the eight qualities. Leading to the water were four steps, each of them made of precious substances: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Sand of gold was strewn, and in the ponds blossomed blue, pink, red, and white lotuses. In the sky above, he emanated a latticed canopy made of the seven precious substances
The courtyard was decorated with numerous silken tassels, the air was filled with pleasant wafts of incense, and there were beds of various flowers, each the size of seven people
Within each of the blue, pink, red, and white lotuses Maudgalyāyana created a monk who looked just like himself
When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana had magically produced a seat of this sort
he went before the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, I have prepared a seat for you. Please know that the time is now right.
the Blessed One then asked
“Maudgalyāyana,” “have you finished arranging my seat?
“Yes, Blessed One, I have,” replied Maudgalyāyana
The Blessed One then addressed the bodhisattva great being Revealing the Accomplishment of Apprehending Infinite Objects
“Noble son, prepare a lion throne for the Thus-Gone One
Seated upon that throne, the Thus-Gone One shall deliver the Dharma teaching known as ‘Truly Satisfying All Sentient Beings.’ 
Paying heed to the Blessed One, the bodhisattva great being Revealing the Accomplishment of Apprehending Infinite Objects then prepared a seat, an
all the bodhisattvas who were in attendance likewise offered their own shawls to the seat, spreading them upon the lion throne
Next the Blessed One formed the following intention
“In order to dispel the doubts and hesitations of these bodhisattvas, I shall produce a miracle. Based on their own Dharma robes, I will grant them a vision of their bodhisattva activities, engagements, aspirations, display of realms, and maturation of sentient beings. I shall let them perceive the features of the realms within which they are to awaken to true and complete buddhahood. Likewise, I shall let them see their perfect hearers, their perfect bodhisattvas, and their perfect Dharma teaching. I shall show them their perfect lifespan, perfect complexion, perfect form, perfect name, perfect marks, perfect endowments, and their perfect Dharma fearlessness.
Then, with his wisdom mind thus inclined, the Blessed One sat down upon his seat and entered the buddhas’ absorption known as revealing the accomplishment of apprehending infinite objects 
As soon as the Blessed One had entered this meditative absorption, all the bodhisattvas who had placed their upper garments upon the Blessed One’s seat now came to perceive everything—from the perfect array of their own future buddha realm up to their perfect Dharma fearlessness—within each of their own shawls
Witnessing all this, the bodhisattvas were deeply gratified and delighted
Joyous and elated, with one voice they sang the following verses to the Blessed One
“O you of proper comportment and conduct, source of excellent qualities, Fearless master of all phenomena
Endowed with all excellent qualities, how beautiful you are
You are a masterful victor who abides in absorption
“You are free from falseness and deceit
Knowing neither pride, agitation, nor pretense
You know the deeds related to knowledge and liberation
Abiding in this meditative absorption, how beautiful you are
“With fearless mastery you remain in meditation And so display unparalleled and unsurpassable miracles
Revealing your unhindered wisdom, With mastery, today you have disclosed the future
“We now think we have attained the peace of the immutable stage
We now think we have entered awakening
We now think we have conquered the māras
We now think we have gained knowledge
“We now think we have attained the supreme eye With which the victorious ones perceive the voidness of all things conditioned
By the kindness of your unhindered wisdom The eye sees, utterly unhindered
“While perceiving distinctly, nothing is seen, And no phenomenon is threatening
When the mind is free from hostility Then that is the supreme buddha eye
“With the victor’s supreme buddha eye The three realms are known and accessed without any hindrance
With a mind in which entity and non-entity are equal You display true diligence, resting within your own vision
“When the Victorious One entered this absorption, He made everyone feel that they had gained accomplishment
All achieved these gateways of retention As well as the supreme gateway of Dharma liberation
“Having entered the gate, become skilled, and achieved purity, The mind of the Victorious One shall never decline
Such is the ripening of great generosity
Such are the qualities of great discipline
“Such are the qualities of great insight
Thus, having relied upon these teachings in the past
As you took your seat and practiced concentration
Lord of men, you shone throughout the ten directions
“Victor, all aspects of death, transference, and karmic action, As they will be for this gathering of your heart children, Became clearly evident today For all gods, nāgas, nonhumans, and kiṃnaras
“Within this illuminating absorption Arose knowledge across eons. Thus, clearing away doubts and hesitations, The best of humans will speak with the voice of a lion
“Pursuing the welfare of self and other
He has been generous in the past
Generous, disciplined, patient, and diligent— Throughout eons, he has practiced for all beings
“Without any gratitude from sentient beings He is generous, disciplined, patient, and diligent
Displaying great skill for the sake of all beings. In this way you enter absorption. “With supreme insight you master such absorption
O hero, as today you took your seat, We joined our palms and requested You to cut through our doubt and dispel our hesitation
“Today we have achieved the illumination of all phenomena. Free from doubt, we have achieved illumination. For us and for beings to come The way of the Dharma will endure for long.
This concludes the first chapter
Present within the gathering was a youth by the name of Padmaśrīgarbha
He now rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee
Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One
As he faced the Blessed One, the following thoughts arose in his mind
“I wish to request the gateways of the Dharma from the Thus-Gone One
I wish to receive the vajra words. I wish to request the words for practice that are without interruption
I wish to request the words that overcome all other statements, the words of progressive discernment, the words wherein all teachings of the Dharma are contained
If the noble sons and daughters practice such a gateway seal
they will attain the stainless eye that sees all phenomena and they will gain expertise regarding the mind
Ah, Blessed One, in the past I have borne my armor through the accumulation of intentions and practical deeds. Thus, you will be aware of my roots of virtue from the past, arisen through the accumulation of intentions and applications.
Aware of the youth Padmaśrīgarbha’s thoughts and prayers, and aware of his practice of accumulating roots of virtue
the Blessed One now looked in the four directions, an
at the same time four great light rays shone forth from his mouth
As this light emerged from the mouth of the Blessed One, it spread out into infinite and endless universes, an
wherever the light reached—whether to trees, walls, mountains, earth, or the empty atmosphere—everything became suffused with a golden color
In this way the light shone unhindered throughout all the cardinal and intermediate directions
Throughout the trichiliocosm, wherever sentient beings were touched by this light their bodies became as if made of gold
Whoever was suffering from the torments of desire, anger, or delusion felt that those afflictions decreased
All beings within the trichiliocosm who were living in hell, suffering the unbearable, ceaseless torments of heat, now experienced relief from their pain due to the power of the Buddha and the power of the bodhisattva’s past prayers
Likewise, all beings within the trichiliocosm who were affected by the obscurations of karma, affliction, and the ripening of karma were freed from their obscurations by the power of the Buddha and the power of the bodhisattva’s past prayers
Next, to intensely brighten the roots of virtue in sentient beings, the Blessed One projected great light from all the pores on his body
This great light traveled to the east, traversing infinitely many universes
Likewise, the same occurred in the south, west, north, zenith, and nadir: the light from the Blessed One shone forth and extended across infinitely many universes
The Blessed One then produced a special sound that likewise could be heard throughout all those universes
At that point, in the east, beyond innumerable universes, there was a universe known as Single Parasol . Within that universe resided the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament had prophesied that after himself the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
Now the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha approached the blessed thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament and asked
“Blessed One, who made this special sound and what is the source of that great light?
The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament replied
“Noble son, to the west of this buddhafield, beyond innumerable world realms, there is a universe known as Enduring
Within that universe resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering a Dharma teaching that belongs to the Bodhisattva Collection, known as ‘Truly Satisfying All Sentient Beings.
Present in the gathering of the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni’s retinue is the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha
That bodhisattva wishes to request the gateway for accomplishing all syllables—the seal whereby one truly engages with all dharmas
“Jālinīprabha, in that buddha realm, the retinue contains bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor, the armor of undifferentiated activity
Jālinīprabha, the bodhisattva great beings who have donned such armor also benefit other buddha realms
Jālinīprabha, anyone born within the buddha realm of the thus-gone Śākyamuni will, upon seeing or hearing those bodhisattva great beings, be protected and cared for by them
Jālinīprabha, needless it is, then, to mention what will be the case when someone, upon seeing these bodhisattva great beings, proceeds to pay them respect, reveres them, venerates them, worships them, and asks them questions.
The bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha then addressed the thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament
“Blessed One, I wish to go to that universe, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, and so that I may see those bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor.
said the thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time is right, then go. But act with mindfulness when you remain in that buddha realm
Why do I say so
Because, noble son, the bodhisattva great beings of that realm are hard to approach.
The thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament then gave an utpala flower that was like a hand to the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha
“Jālinīprabha,” he said, “you should offer this hand-like utpala flower to the thus-gone Śākyamuni
Tell him that the blessed thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament inquires whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease.
The bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha bowed his head to the feet of the thus-gone one, the blessed buddha Single Jewel Ornament, and then circumambulated him three times
Accompanied by bodhisattva great beings beyond number and count, he next traveled to the world of Enduring, arriving there in a single instant of the mind
Once here, he proceeded to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha, and the place where the Blessed One was residing
Bowing his head to the Blessed One’s feet, he said
“Blessed One, the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha bows his head to your feet in homage
Blessed One, I am Jālinīprabha
Bliss-Gone One, I am Jālinīprabha, an
in homage I bow my head to your feet.
replied the Blessed One
“Jālinīprabha,” “you shall live long, an
you shall be happy and healthy.
Having in this way bowed to the Blessed One’s feet, the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha sat to one side and from there addressed the Blessed One
“Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament inquires whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease
The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament also sends a hand-like utpala flower for the Blessed One
Blessed One, please therefore accept this hand-like utpala flower from the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha.
The Blessed One accepted the flower and then gave it to the bodhisattva Ajita
Holding the hand-like utpala, the bodhisattva Ajita turned to a group of five hundred that included the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla
“Kinsmen,” said the bodhisattva Ajita, “the Thus-Gone One has given us this hand-like utpala.
Bhadrapāla, leading the group of five hundred bodhisattvas, now held the hand-like utpala and addressed the Blessed One in the following way
“Blessed One, we have undertaken proper practices and carry out bodhisattva activities. Therefore, is anyone who hears our names certain to awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
Blessed One, the bodhisattva Ajita has given us this hand-like utpala
Blessed One, relying on the power of our aspirations, activities, intentions, and resolve never to abandon sentient beings, we shall today toss this hand-like utpala in supplication of the Thus-Gone One
Blessed One, we likewise toss it before all the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas who remain and reside in the east. We also toss this flower before the blessed ones who have not yet appeared there, before those who are still to appear there, before those who are now appearing, and before those who are disappearing
We do so, likewise, in all the universes located in the south, west, north, nadir, and zenith, as well as in the intermediate directions—we toss this flower before all the blessed buddhas who are present there, or who will appear there
Blessed One, may each and every being who sees this hand-like utpala also experience its fragrance
May each and every one of them be certain to awaken to unsurpassable, true, and perfect buddhahood
May they also journey throughout all buddha realms.
Then, as they tossed the hand-like utpala, the Blessed One touched the flower with his right hand
As soon as he touched it a half-sized body of the Thus-Gone One appeared within the utpala. Moreover, within each of the utpalas there was again a half-sized version of the Thus-Gone One
All these half-sized bodies of the Thus-Gone One now declared, “The teachers of those who do not know all phenomena to be like an illusion, and who are not inclined to think so; the teachers of those who do not know all phenomena to be stainless and devoid of characteristics, and who are not inclined to think so—the teachers of all those who have no such comprehension are neither thus-gone ones, nor hearers of the thus-gone ones.
Speaking such words, they departed
They also spoke the following verses
“Illusion-like phenomena cannot be grasped, And all that cannot be grasped is like the moon in water
Because they are empty, they do not possess any empty nature. Thus, this intrinsic nature has been taught by the victorious ones
“Absence of characteristics is the true characteristic of all phenomena
With such a nature, devoid of characteristics, Upon examination all phenomena are empty and devoid of self. They cannot be grasped, nor serve as grounds for dispute
“Whenever beings wish for this intrinsic nature Their wish occurs by the blessings Of the victorious teachers of great power, And their activities throughout the worlds in the ten directions.
After the Thus-Gone One’s emanations had proclaimed these verses, they moved ahead, into the ten directions
Now the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, those noble sons are perfectly trained in aspiration. Any sentient being who hears their prayers, or pronounces their names, will be entirely freed from the experience of numerous pains, and they will become destined for unsurpassable and perfect awakening. What a wonder this is
But, Blessed One, such blessed ones and such noble sons are not suited for this universe
Why not
“Blessed One, as an analogy, a man or woman may have heard of the fame of a priceless and flawless jewel, a jewel that can deliver all possible benefit and happiness
That person may then wish to search for the jewel, and he or she may also have learned the specific characteristics of that precious jewel
Now, imagine that this man or woman sees that immaculate jewel in the middle of the dirt in a latrine pit, or some other filthy place. Around that spot there are some bamboo cane workers, untouchables, outcastes, or some other hard-laboring people of low caste
Those people have never heard of that jewel, so they obviously do not know about its qualities either
it would be out of the question
Now, the first person who sees the jewel in the filth may remark that the place where that precious jewel is kept is not a very beautiful one
But the others will just respond
‘Which precious jewel do you have such praise for?
Even though the first person may explain about and even point to the jewel, the ignorant people will not understand. They will say, ‘Hey you, why are you talking about the qualities of a precious jewel
That “precious jewel” does not have any good qualities
You are a liar and a trickster
We do not believe anything you say.
The first person may then extract the jewel and lift it out from the dirt
As soon as the jewel emerges the poor people will become extremely upset at each other, an
from then on they will be surrounded by numerous harms. “Blessed One, we are here in the world of Enduring, a place where poor beings of lesser roots of virtue are born
Blessed One, the way we perceive you within this world is similar to the way the person of learning in the analogy sees and recognizes the precious jewel in the midst of the filth
Blessed One, we see the blessed thus-gone ones and the bodhisattva great beings who don the inconceivable armor to be like perfect and completely pure jewels, capable of granting all manner of happiness
Yet, Blessed One, other beings within this world regard them in a way that is similar to the way the poor and lowly people of the area look at the precious jewel
“Blessed One, in the analogy a person heard about the jewel’s qualities and decided to search for it
When seeing the jewel in a pit of filth, he or she remarked that the jewel was not kept in a proper place. Similarly
Blessed One, the blessed buddhas and the bodhisattvas present throughout the ten directions also remark that the Blessed One’s buddha realm is not befitting to him. In this way they praise the blessed Buddha and all the bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor
“In the analogy, Blessed One, a man or woman heard about the qualities of a precious jewel, decided to go searching for it, found the jewel stuck in filth, and subsequently declared that the jewel was not being kept properly. We, similarly, have heard praises of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha as well as of the bodhisattva great beings who have donned the inconceivable armor
Hence we journeyed here to behold them
But being here, Blessed One
we see that this universe is plagued by hundreds of shortcomings and that sentient beings here possess inferior roots of virtue
“Blessed One, the precious jewel in the mud does not lose its brilliance and, just as in that analogy, the thus-gone ones in the ten directions and the bodhisattva great beings who don the inconceivable armor do not lose their radiance either
However, because the intentions and aspirations of beings here are of an inferior quality, the Blessed One has caused his luster to extend for a distance of no more than one fathom
“In the analogy, Blessed One, the poor people do not believe what they hear about the qualities of the jewel. Likewise
beings in this universe do not believe in the Thus-Gone One’s extreme brilliance, his vast aspirations, his emanations, and his qualities of awakening
Needless it is, then, to state that they do not have faith in the bodhisattva great beings either
“Blessed One, when the person in the analogy takes out the precious jewel from the dirt, that immediately causes the others there to experience great harm. Similarly
when the Thus-Gone One passes completely beyond suffering and the bodhisattva great beings depart for other world realms it causes bodhisattvas who retain sūtras and who pursue true retention to become extremely disturbed with one another. ‘The Dharma is no longer heard; only non-Dharma can be heard here.
And why is that
Because under such circumstances those who live here would fall into non-Dharma and pursue non-Dharmic means of livelihood
They would struggle with, defame, criticize, and disparage one another
They would cause each other to lose their virtuous qualities, and thus experience suffering. They would no longer apply themselves to Dharma and virtue
“Blessed One, no noble son or daughter in pursuit of the meaningful, committed to the pursuit of meaning, and committed to the accomplishment of a buddha’s awakening would in that case take birth in this world. As not even followers of the Hearer Vehicle would appear, what need is there to mention those who adhere to the Bodhisattva Vehicle
Why do I say so, Blessed One? Well, the beings who live in the great hell realms, such as Incessant Pain, Revival, Heat , and Intense Heat, do not experience happiness for even one moment, for even a mere instant
Blessed One, from the perspective of the bodhisattvas in Single Parasol —the realm of the blessed thus-gone one Single Jewel Ornament—the bodhisattva great beings who are born in this Enduring world are comparable to the beings born in the Hell of Incessant Pain, because they do not perceive them to experience any happiness at all
“In a buddha realm of sheer and supreme happiness sentient beings are naturally blissful
But, Blessed One, the beings who are born in this universe find it hard to believe what I say. Nevertheless, Blessed One, I have come here to clear my doubts about the Dharma and to listen to the gateway of the Dharma seal. Blessed One, we seek teaching from you
And why
Because, Blessed One, all pleasure and pain is impermanent
From the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha we wish to hear a Dharma in which there is no happiness, no suffering, no permanence, no impermanence, no thought, no conception, no entity, no absence of entity, nothing conditioned, nothing unconditioned, nothing imputed, nothing not imputed, nothing mundane, nothing beyond the world, nothing defiled, nothing undefiled, no truth, no falsity, no awakening, no branches of awakening, no powers, no light, no darkness, no consciousness, no absence of consciousness, no fruition, no lack of fruition, no path, no absence of path, no beginning, no completion, no world, and no liberation from the world
And why is that so
Because, Blessed One, the world should be taught about the happiness that arises from the accumulation of merit and from making resolutions, and all other such things
Blessed One, the qualities of buddhahood cannot be taught
That is to say, in buddhahood there are no powers, no fearlessnesses, no miracles, no miraculous displays, no advice, no miraculous advice, no teaching, and no miraculous teaching
There are no fearlessnesses nor powers, an
there is neither happiness nor suffering
Because all that is thought, all that is conceptual movement
“Blessed One, whether someone qualifies for the title of ‘thus-gone one’ is not to be decided in terms of whether or not suchness has been attained
All that is conceptual movement, thought, straying, and construction
Truth and falsity, the conditioned and the unconditioned, the defiled and the undefiled, negativity and lack of negativity, the mundane and the supramundane, being disciplined and having flawed discipline, having powers and not having powers, being fearless and not being fearless, being worthy of donations and not being worthy of donations, being a thus-gone one, being a buddha, being a bodhisattva, being a hearer, being a solitary buddha, as well as prayers, and blessings—all such thinking is completely crushed by the thus-gone ones and the path is comprehended completely
That is why the thus-gone ones are undaunted like lions. That is why they trumpet like elephants
When they make their assertions, the thus-gone ones let there be disagreement where there is disagreement and agreement where there is agreement
The thus-gone ones make their assertions with mindfulness and wisdom, and with both dwell in equanimity
“The states of the blessed thus-gone ones are states of awakening and states that are self-arisen. Since they are not even shared by hearers or solitary buddhas, they are of course not common to other lowly beings
And why, Blessed One, are they not shared with others
Because all other lowly beings cannot achieve states that are of that quality, or that are so comprehensive, or that are of the same duration, or with the same application, or that involve such bliss. Blessed One, without the thus-gone ones, no sentient being can achieve such states
Blessed One, such states are not accessible to any other being. Blessed One, states of this kind are not accessible to any hearer or solitary buddha
Blessed One, ‘not accessible’ here means that they are not effectuated or experienced
Hence they are inaccessible
And why is this so
Because such states surpass the experience of hearers and solitary buddhas
And why is that the case
Because, Blessed One, such states are infinite
And why, Blessed One, are such states infinite
Because, Blessed One, the wishes of the thus-gone ones are infinite
they cannot be matched by anything at all
And why is this so
Because, Blessed One, such states are beyond language
Being ‘beyond language’ is to be inexpressible, an
language is nothing but expression. Therefore, Blessed One, these states are self-arisen
“Blessed One, beings who do not observe such states and do not understand them must go through death and transfer to other world realms
Beings who do not comprehend such states come to suffer great harm
“Blessed One, the state of the thus-gone ones is the ultimate gateway, the gateway of the Dharma
It contains sixty-eight thousand subsidiary gateways
The awakening of the thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament is limitless like space and the bodhisattva great beings gain accomplishment through the extent of the very same gateway.
When this gateway teaching was delivered and explained, seventy-seven thousand bodhisattva great beings attained the gateway of the stainless Dharma, which is the very state of the thus-gone ones
They all thus declared, “Today we have attained awakening! Today we have attained awakening!
Furthermore, one quadrillion beings set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening, an
because of their initial generation of the mind of awakening the Blessed One prophesied their attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening
Likewise, eight sextillion beings attained the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena, an
three thousand monks liberated their minds from defilement with no further perpetuation
At this point the Blessed One smiled, an
as soon as he did so a magnificent light shone forth in the world and the great earth shook
The venerable Ānanda now draped his Dharma robe over one shoulder and knelt on his right knee
Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and inquired
“When the Blessed One smiled, a magnificent light shone in the world and the great earth shook. What were the causes and conditions for this to happen?
the Blessed One replied
“Ānanda,” “when the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha taught and explained this gateway of the Dharma
seventy-seven thousand bodhisattvas attained the gateway of the stainless Dharma seal
Ānanda, the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha has obtained this teaching of the Dharma seal from eight thousand buddhas at locations throughout the expanse of space
Having thus obtained this stainless Dharma gateway, he has gained deliverance by means of it, and so he has become skilled in journeying from buddha realm to buddha realm.
At that time, beyond seventy-eight innumerable buddha realms to the west, there was a world known as Single Heap of Jewels. Within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Infinite Jewel Leader
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma to a retinue of many hundreds of thousands
Present in that gathering was also the regent of the blessed one Infinite Jewel Leader, the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader
Hearing a clear voice, and perceiving the light from the thus-gone Śākyamuni, the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader asked the thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader
“Blessed One, whose is this clear voice, and whose is this radiance?
Then the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Infinite Jewel Leader said to the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader
“Purposeful Compelling Leader, to the west, beyond seventy-eight innumerable universes, there is a world known as Enduring
Within that universe resides a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is now teaching a gathering headed by incomparable bodhisattvas
He is delivering a Dharma teaching belonging to the Bodhisattva Collection that satisfies all beings and is known as ‘Cutting through the Doubts of All Beings.
At this point the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader said to the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Infinite Jewel Leader
“Blessed One, I wish to go to the world known as Enduring, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, and so that I may see those incomparable bodhisattvas.
replied the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time has come, then go. But act with mindfulness as you remain in that buddha realm
Why do I say that
Because, Purposeful Compelling Leader, the bodhisattva great beings born in that world are hard to approach
When you arrive, ask on my behalf whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease
You must also offer this hand-like lotus flower to the Thus-Gone One.
The bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader then rose from his seat, and bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one
After he had also circumambulated that blessed one, he left for the world of Enduring, accompanied by seventy-eight thousand other bodhisattvas
As soon as they arrived, all the flowering trees and fruit trees in Enduring bore flowers and fruits regardless of the season
A rain of flowers and scented water fell from the sky, an
numerous musical sounds could be heard
The bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader proceeded to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha
Arriving there, he bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One
Holding on to the Blessed One’s feet with both hands, an
touching them to his head, he said
“Blessed One, the bodhisattva Purposeful Compelling Leader bows his head to your feet in homage.
replied the Blessed One
“Purposeful Compelling Leader,” “you have offered your respect, worship, and veneration.
Then the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader stood up and
standing before the Blessed One, he said
“The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Infinite Jewel Leader inquires whether the Blessed One may have encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease
Blessed One, he also sends you a hand-like lotus flower, requesting that out of your great love you accept it from the bodhisattva Purposeful Compelling Leader.
Having in this way received the hand-like lotus flower from the bodhisattva, the Blessed One inquired
“Purposeful Compelling Leader, has the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and does he remain unchanged?
replied Purposeful Compelling Leader
“Blessed One,” “the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader has encountered but little hardship. He is strong and remains unchanged, happily enjoying his buddha realm.
Then the Blessed One gave the hand-like lotus flower to the bodhisattva great being Ajita
Holding up the lotus, the bodhisattva great being Ajita offered the following prayer
“Blessed One, by this root of virtue, may the buddha realms of all noble sons and daughters who set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening be perfectly pure, an
may sentient beings gain maturity
Why do I express this prayer
Because, Blessed One, it is hard to teach the Dharma to beings who are not mature, who have not engendered roots of virtue, who possess lesser roots of virtue, or who are inspired by what is inferior
“And what is here the objective
The objective is, Blessed One, for this hand-like lotus flower to enable beings to perceive whichever realm of the world they may wish. The objective is for the flower to enable the perception of the world known as Heap of Jewels , the buddha realm of the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader. It is to enable the perception of the bodhisattvas of that world, who have truly entered their vehicle, as well as the perception of the perfect hearers there, who for the most part are endowed with the threefold or sixfold knowledge
“In that blessed thus-gone one’s buddha realm the lotus flowers are produced through a great ripening of karma
Hence, Blessed One, I dedicate this root of virtue so that bodhisattvas may be free from obscuration with regard to any phenomenon
Blessed One, I dedicate this root of virtue so that those bodhisattvas who have not yet engendered the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening may do so
I dedicate this root of virtue toward the thus-gone ones’ perfect awakening to the suchness of all phenomena and their perfect awakening to the suchness that is free from disturbance.
Then the Blessed One asked Bhadrapāla
“Bhadrapāla, do you understand what Maitreya has said
What are the phenomena to which the thus-gone ones perfectly awaken?
replied Bhadrapāla
“Blessed One,” “there are no phenomena that pertain to the thus-gone ones’ perfect awakening to suchness and their perfect awakening to freedom from disturbance
Blessed One, the thus-gone ones do not apprehend any such phenomena, since there are no such phenomena, nor is there an absence of such phenomena
Blessed One, if such a phenomenon was apprehended, it would only be the apprehending of the perception of the phenomenon by the thus-gone ones; but the thus-gone ones do not apprehend any such perception
Why is that
Because, Blessed One, there are no perceptions at all
Since the thus-gone ones do not even apprehend themselves, it goes without saying that they do not apprehend any perception
let alone having any authentic engagement in the perception of phenomena as phenomena
“Blessed One, the Blessed One has not said that any phenomena at all are grasped, nor that they are relinquished, nor that they are transcended, nor that they are attained, by those phenomena being perceived as they are and because they are so
What, then, does this mean
Blessed One, if the thus-gone ones were to seek phenomena, where would they seek them
Those phenomena are suchness, and within suchness there is no thus-gone one
Moreover, the thus-gone ones are suchness; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of suchness
For the thus-gone ones there are no marks; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of the absence of marks
The thus-gone ones are free of marks; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of freedom from marks
The thus-gone ones know minds; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of knowing minds
The thus-gone ones are free from disturbance. They are thus-gone ones by virtue of freedom from disturbance
Moreover, all phenomena are just like the thus-gone ones. They are thus-gone ones by virtue of being just like them
“In this way, Blessed One, all phenomena are thus-gone ones
That is why, Blessed One, the thus-gone ones remain within the lotuses, and just as they remain within the lotuses, so likewise they remain in the state of a thus-gone, and in the state of awakening
Those who neither grasp nor apprehend that in which they remain in that way are to be classified as worthy recipients of offerings in this world.
asked the Blessed One
“Bhadrapāla,” “where do you remain as you speak these words?
replied Bhadrapāla
“Blessed One,” “I remain exactly where the world remains, and I speak these words from there
However, this is not the way childish beings grasp it
How, then, do childish beings grasp
They grasp disturbance, and because they grasp disturbance, they are disturbed, and very disturbed
Blessed One, the world does not remain
In what sense does it not remain
In the sense that an illusion does not remain
Yet childish beings argue, saying, ‘My place, that is the world.
However, this is not the realm of childish beings
The world does not remain within that which is an optical illusion, nor does it remain within that which is impermanent
Yet this frightens childish beings
The world does not remain within that which is a hallucination, an
this is not any different from noble beings
The world does not remain within the repulsive, ye
childish beings are motivated by karma
Here, Blessed One, where the world remains, there is no occasion for any of the disturbance of the world
Hence, Blessed One, the place where I remain is here alone, where the world remains.
The Blessed One now asked the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla
“Bhadrapāla, do you say this through truly seeing phenomena?
replied Bhadrapāla
“Blessed One,” “whatever is a phenomenon is only not what the Blessed One has perfectly awoken to.
The Blessed One then inquired of the bodhisattva great being, Bhadrapāla
“Bhadrapāla, have I not perfectly awoken to all phenomena?
answered Bhadrapāla
“Blessed One, have you perfectly awoken to all phenomena?
“Blessed One, that to which which you have perfectly awoken, is that phenomena, or is it not phenomena?
replied the Blessed One
“Well said, Bhadrapāla,” “well said
That which the thus-gone ones fully awake to is neither phenomena, nor is it an absence of phenomena
Bhadrapāla, my wisdom does not move somewhere, and my eyes do not engage something
There is no cognition of beings, nor any engagement of the mind
No appearance is cognized, yet neither is any exclusion cognized or apprehended
That is because this is neither affliction, nor purification
“However, Bhadrapāla, even if I explain to sentient beings about the notion of the experience of no characteristics, and the phenomena of the experience of no characteristics, they become bewildered
Bhadrapāla, apart from thus-gone ones and bodhisattva great beings in their final existence, you will not be able to find or observe anyone who can accept this
Bhadrapāla, even when bodhisattva great beings who are in their final existence, held back by just that single birth, hear this Dharma it still frightens them
So what need is there to mention the case of lowly sentient beings
It is impossible for them to comprehend this Dharma
“Bhadrapāla, there will come a time when all monks and nuns and all male and female lay practitioners are physically and mentally untrained, and lack training in discipline and insight
Bhadrapāla, when such persons hear the teaching of the Dharma treasure and the treasure of the thus-gone one, in which the awakening of the thus-gone ones, being beyond thought, affliction, and perception, is not accessed
they will be frightened, scared, and afraid. And thus they will fall into the abyss
The reason for this is that, while it is taught that ‘the thus-gone ones have perfectly awakened to all phenomena,’ there is also the teaching that, ‘my wisdom, eyes, and mind do not have any access to it.
“Therefore, such monks who teach the sūtras will develop the wish to harm, hurt, kill, and cause unrest
Bhadrapāla, at that time, those who rise up against me in this way will be in control
How unfortunate that time will be when those who teach my true wisdom will be castigated
“Bhadrapāla, the Thus-Gone One has no teacher and is self-arisen. Such fools do not understand the Thus-Gone One as he now lets his lion’s roar be heard within the circle of disciples, and they do not understand the intrinsic nature of the Thus-Gone One
Consider how, lacking knowledge and vision, they will fail to recognize that which is a praise to me, and instead take something that actually is no praise to be just that
“Bhadrapāla, you may wonder what that which is no praise entails
Bhadrapāla, any teaching concerned with grasping at something is no praise to me
That is why I say that at that time those people will defame me, rise against me, and undermine virtuous mendicants. Mendicants of that kind are corrupted and putrid, like rotting trees. Their way of looking at things is that of an extremist, a dualist, an adherent to permanence and annihilation. Theirs is the way of the arrogant Dharma teachers who suffer from Dharma conceit, of those involved in mental construction, of those involved in the formation of notions, of those fond of materialism, of those partaking in saṃsāra, and of those who turn their backs on the path of the true view
“At that time such persons will develop the notion of the ultimate; adhere to the sacrificial fire ritual, becoming unbraided; profess to objects, and profess to agents
However, Bhadrapāla, if they possess the proper absorption, they will also realize awakening
“Bhadrapāla, when I have passed into nirvāṇa, such people will perceive flaws in terms of object and agent, and thus regress
When they then go forth in my teachings they will make that Dharma fade away
“Thus, Bhadrapāla, after I have passed into nirvāṇa
such fools will perform the sacrificial fire ritual. They will become like the braided, like those who are old and the dull witted
“Bhadrapāla, such people are involved with reference points, constructs, and karmic formation. By means of a mundane view they engage with my objects and agents and teach but little in terms of the wisdom of the buddhas
I say that what such people teach is no praise to me and is not emancipation
And why not
Because, Bhadrapāla, such people make use of an impure and insignificant fire that discards the awakening accomplished through millions of incalculable eons
Bhadrapāla, such people defame the Thus-Gone One and rise up against him
“Bhadrapāla, you may then wonder what it is to praise the Thus-Gone One and proclaim his words
Bhadrapāla, those who do so do not grasp, construct, or develop karmic formations with respect to any phenomenon. They do not pursue the three times, but are beyond statements and beyond abandonment
Such people, Bhadrapāla, utter praise to the Thus-Gone One, and they do not impute. Those are the offspring of the buddhas, the children of their minds. They are born from the Dharma
“Bhadrapāla, teachers and upholders of such sūtras proclaim the words of the Thus-Gone One. They proclaim the Dharma and have entered the Thus-Gone One’s teaching in accord with the Dharma. Those are my children, the children of my heart, the children of my voice. They are blessed by me and appointed by me. I have brought them true delight and they have established the shrine of the Dharma
They have beaten the drum of the Dharma and blown the Dharma conch
They have raised high the Dharma’s victory banner
Inspired by the blessed buddhas such beings have accumulated proper activities
They adhere to the garland of the excellent qualities and are appointed as their guardians
They defeat adversaries and are like flowers in the world
Encountering such beings is extremely rare. Their vision is pure an
they are vessels of awakening. The bodhisattvas bring them joy
The thus-gone ones bring them joy
They have opened their vision of the Dharma and are not obscured with respect to any phenomenon
They rightly please the thus-gone ones and repay their kindness
Adorned with the ornaments of the Dharma, they are saturated with wisdom
Letting the rain of Dharma fall, they satisfy the heart children of the victorious ones
Causing the qualities of buddhahood to increase, they display the foliage of excellent qualities
Blossoming with the flowers of the branches of awakening, they produce the fruits of freedom from desirous attachment
Residing on the seat of awakening, they attain unexcelled and perfect awakening
They are the guides who show the path
they are immersed in Dharma generosity
In short, Bhadrapāla, even if all the thus-gone ones explain the qualities of such noble children, people will find it hard to trust
Bhadrapāla, such beings are the ones who proclaim my praises. Those are teachers who speak in accord with the Dharma
“Bhadrapāla, this is how it is. Think of a man who has seen Lake Anavatapta and heard its praises
That man may then see another great lake and say
‘The dimensions of that lake are exactly like those of Anavatapta ! I shall sing the praises of Anavatapta !
Yet what he then proclaims is not going to be a praise. “Bhadrapāla, the people of the aforementioned kind are similar fools. While deprived of the right kind of qualities and the right kind of wisdom they nevertheless say, ‘We shall sing the praises of the Thus-Gone One!
Thus, while abiding by the mundane view, engaging in formation, and engaging all the aggregates of defilement, they maintain this conduct yet declare, ‘The wisdom of the thus-gone ones is unimpeded! Let us offer our praise!
Yet what they proceed to say is certainly no praise
“Think, Bhadrapāla, of this analogy. A person may know the word gold , and may also have heard descriptions of the yellow, radiant color of gold
But even if that person sees the golden color of the Jāmbū River, and hears about its precious value
he might ignore it. He might also scold the people who informed him, saying, ‘That which you are talking about does not have the yellow color of gold!
“Likewise, Bhadrapāla, the aforementioned blind fools may have heard the name of the Thus-Gone One, and they may also have heard the word Dharma. They may have heard that the name for the Dharma is the true view , and they may have heard it said that the Thus-Gone One’s name, family, dominion, retinue, comportment, and conduct are all perfect
But they have not heard of the characteristic of the Thus-Gone One’s wisdom—the characteristic that makes him a thus-gone one, a blessed one, a perfect buddha. Neither have they heard of the characteristic of the Dharma—the characteristic through which the Thus-Gone One delivers all teachings, the characteristic of the Thus-Gone One’s wisdom
Moreover, when at some point they do in fact hear about the characteristic of the Thus-Gone One’s wisdom, such fools proceed to reject it
“Bhadrapāla, somebody may have heard the word ocean yet not be aware of the ocean’s qualities
The same person may then be told that the ocean is eighty-four thousand leagues deep and limitless leagues wide. He or she may likewise hear that the ocean abounds with numerous jewels, that it is of a single taste, and that it neither increases nor becomes depleted. When hearing such descriptions of how the ocean does not fill up although fed by the rivers, how they are the source of so many jewels, and how its extent is limitless, this person may object that ‘the ocean could not possibly have such characteristics!’ “Likewise
Bhadrapāla, those fools have heard the name Thus-Gone One and the word buddha . But they have not heard about the qualities of the thus-gone ones or the qualities of knowing the Dharma
However, at some point they may come to hear Dharma teachings concerning the omniscient wisdom, full of limitless jewels of the Dharma. They may hear of how the precious Dharma is free from desire and how it provides boundless means for achieving great liberation. They may hear of the unobscured buddha eye, how the undefiled qualities know neither increase nor decrease, and how they are hard to fathom and free from disturbance. They may come to hear that all phenomena bear the seal of wisdom. Likewise, they may be told that just like the ocean will not retain a human corpse, the thus-gone ones will not rest with beings who are spoiled by dense, dark views. Similarly, they may hear the teaching that just like the ocean is always salty, the liberation of the thus-gone ones is also always of one taste
Yet they do not understand this and they do not believe it
Not trusting it, they deny that any of this could be the case
“Consider, Bhadrapāla, how fools never question their own knowledge or the extent of their training
However, I declare that there will come a time when they say, ‘We do not know the proper conduct and practice. We do not understand karmic action and the way karma ripens. We do not know what actions led us to birth here, and where our present actions will bring us. We do not know what the realm will be, nor what our features and practice are going to be. Neither do we know whether or not we will be able to act based on insight.
Such unquestioning fools may develop the idea that these Dharma teachings are neither Dharma, nor any praise to me
In that case my words will have become the reason for such fools not to rely on the sūtras
“When, after my passing, someone expresses a praise to the Thus-Gone One, or to the Dharma, or to the Saṅgha, the
you must not be disrespectful or distrustful
You must not let your mind turn away, and you must not be displeased. This is how the Thus-Gone One instructs you
“My instruction, here, is that a hostile mind is not the way of mendicants; it is common to those who are not mendicants. Moreover
not being a mendicant and following the ways of those who are not mendicants is flawed in numerous ways
The awakening of the thus-gone ones is hard to fathom
Hence, my instruction is that only the applications of mindfulness should be taught
“Bhadrapāla, the way all phenomena essentially abide is beyond abiding, an
this way of abiding is nonconceptual
Bhadrapāla, in this context, the three gateways to access, realization, and liberation are the gateways to the applications of mindfulness
“Bhadrapāla, tenable and untenable are duality
Bhadrapāla, in the true view and the relinquishment of extremes that comes from not observing any extremes there is no attachment to duality
Bhadrapāla, the thus-gone ones’ relinquishment of extremes is not due to a failure to identify such extremes
Rather, the thus-gone ones have abandoned extremes because they do not observe any
Bhadrapāla, the wise do not understand the qualities of the thus-gone ones’ relinquishment in the same way that childish beings take them to be
Those qualities, Bhadrapāla, are characterized neither by relinquishment nor transcendence
Their characteristics are neither in terms of abandonment nor attainment
“Bhadrapāla, once a deity came before me and asked
‘Mendicant, are you in high spirits?
I replied
‘Deity,’ ‘what should I have gained?
Again the god asked, ‘Mendicant, are you depressed?
I replied
‘Deity,’ ‘what should I have wasted?
At this point the god exclaimed
‘A mendicant who is neither in high spirits nor depressed is indeed an excellent mendicant!
Bhadrapāla, that god is now present in this gathering
He has, Bhadrapāla, comprehended how all phenomena are of the nature of nirvāṇa
In the past he has served five hundred buddhas, an
as the result of such service his superknowledges are agile
“Bhadrapāla, I do not say that beings who lack roots of virtue, or whose roots of virtue have not matured, will be inspired to pursue the training in this Dharma teaching
Nor do I perceive any such inspiration in the listeners either
“Bhadrapāla, when someone hears these teachings and becomes inspired and develops faith and trust, the associated roots of virtue are of a lesser, inner kind
Above that stage, as the wisdom of great insight unfolds, one will experience wisdom. The roots of virtue that arise from that are vast.
Bhadrapāla and the others among the five hundred bodhisattvas then tossed the hand-like lotus flower before the Blessed One, offering it with the following words
“Blessed One, may all who witness this Dharma teaching of the hand-like lotus flower and pursue or apply themselves to it become destined for unexcelled and perfect awakening
Blessed One, may all the blessed buddhas who reside, remain, and flourish throughout the ten directions—all such thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas—apprehend this Dharma teaching and teach it for the sake of ripening the factors of awakening within sentient beings.
Aware of all this, the Blessed One now said to the bodhisattva great being Bhadrapāla
“Bhadrapāla, you bear your armor for the sake of ripening the factors of awakening within sentient beings, and you request the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas to teach the Dharma to these sentient beings. Does this mean that sentient beings are of some benefit to you?
In reply, the bodhisattva great being Bhadrapāla addressed the Blessed One
“Blessed One, I have no wish to send those who benefit me to buddha realms. Nor do I feel disinclined to do so with those who harm me. I do not bear my armor for sentient beings in order to harm or benefit anyone
Blessed One, the armor donned by bodhisattvas is not of that kind
“Blessed One, let us take the analogy of a perfect, wish-fulfilling tree with blossoming flowers on all its branches, a tree that is of great delight to the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. As they perceive this heavenly, wish-fulfilling tree in full bloom
the gods of the Thirty-Three will, to their hearts’ content, enjoy and revel in superhuman sense pleasures
But, Blessed One, do the gods of the Thirty-Three then harm or benefit that perfect, wish-fulfilling tree that is in full bloom
As they see the perfect, wish-fulfilling tree the gods of the Thirty-Three will be delighted
To their hearts’ content, they will enjoy and revel in superhuman sense pleasures, and touching that heavenly, wish-fulfilling tree in full bloom, they will be overjoyed
Yet the gods of the Thirty-Three certainly neither benefit nor harm that perfect, wish-fulfilling tree in any way at all
But to partake of their enjoyments the gods of the Thirty-Three are required to be near that perfect, wish-fulfilling tree, whose branches are all in full bloom. “Similarly
Blessed One, by no means do sentient beings either harm or benefit me
However, in terms of the accomplishment of wisdom, the wisdom of the buddhas
it is as in the analogy of that perfect wish-fulfilling tree in full bloom. All these infinitely and innumerably many sentient beings must by all means be present. Hence I don my armor for the sake of sentient beings
Moreover, by means of the five masteries of the thus-gone ones, who themselves are not subject to being pleased, sentient beings will experience joy. Just like the gods of the Thirty-Three, they will be happy, frolic, and revel to their hearts’ content
“Blessed One, we bear our armor in order to disengage from sentient beings—not for the sake of observing them
We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the self—not for the sake of observing it
We bear it for the sake of disengaging from phenomena—not for the sake of observing them
We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the aggregates—not for the sake of observing them
We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the elements—not for the sake of observing them
We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the sense sources—not for the sake of observing them
Such is the armor of disengagement that we bear
“Blessed One, this is an armor of disengagement
It is not an armor and does not bring the results of an armor
Hence, it is not worn for the sake of obtaining anything at all. Neither is it worn for the sake of giving up anything. We do not think of it as an armor, or assert it to be so
We do not assert it to be in any particular way, as having any particular extent, or as having any particular purpose. Such is the armor that we bear
“Blessed One, if we were to assert the armor in any way, we would also perpetuate the self. But
Blessed One, we do not perpetuate the self
We do not perpetuate it; bodhisattvas do not apprehend there being or not being a self
Blessed One, if there is abiding on there not being a self, that implies nothing but abiding on the existence of a self
This is because, Blessed One, all phenomena are beyond abiding
Blessed One, this is how we train with our armor in the world
That is to say, this is not a training in anything at all.
The bodhisattva great being Bhadrapāla then spoke as follows to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, I do not perceive the qualities of ordinary persons to be ‘far away,’ nor do I perceive the qualities of the buddhas to be ‘nearby.
I do not perceive the qualities of training to be ‘distant,
nor do I perceive the qualities of the buddhas to be ‘close.
I do not perceive such a thing as ‘the qualities of buddhahood,
nor do I perceive in terms of anything being ‘in accord with the qualities of buddhahood.
Blessed One, I neither perceive any benefits, nor do I perceive any flaws. Such is the armor that I have donned
Such is the armor that I bear in the world.
Bhadrapāla and the others among the five hundred bodhisattvas who had tossed the lotus flower before the Blessed One then journeyed out into the worlds of the ten directions
They let a rain fall on the blessed buddhas, and they brought sentient beings to maturation
At that time there was in the east, beyond countless and innumerable universes, a universe known as Marks of Royal Splendor, and within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha called Roar of Signlessness
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
This blessed one had prophesied that following himself the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
Now, having seen the great light and heard the special sound, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin addressed the blessed thus-gone Roar of Signlessness
“Blessed One, from whence comes this special sound, and what is the source of this great illumination?
replied the Blessed One to the bodhisattva great being
“Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin,” “west of this buddha realm, beyond countless and innumerable world realms, there is a universe known as Enduring
Within that universe resides the thus-gone one Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering a Dharma teaching that belongs to the Bodhisattva Collection and is known as ‘Truly Satisfying All Sentient Beings by Eliminating Their Doubts.
That is the source of the light and the distinctive sound
In that buddha realm have arrived, within the circle of the retinue, infinite and unfathomable bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor.
In response, the bodhisattva said to that blessed one
“Blessed One, I wish to visit that universe so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni
I also wish to see those bodhisattvas
And why
Because it is hard to even hear about such beings. Needless it is, then, to mention how difficult it is to behold and venerate them.
The thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Roar of Signlessness then said to the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin
“Noble son, if you know that the time has come, then go
The Thus-Gone One grants you permission.” The bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin then rose from his seat
He bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one and circumambulated him
Upon his departure, the Blessed One then placed a lotus flower in the bodhisattva’s hand and told him, “Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin, you must offer this lotus flower to the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni on my behalf.
Thus, the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin came to the world of Enduring with that lotus flower in his hand
Then, from that great lotus flower appeared all the superior beings who had been part of the retinue of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Roar of Signlessness, when he engaged in bodhisattva activity
Moreover, so that this could be experienced by the sentient beings there, similar such great lotus flowers now spread throughout the universe
Holding the lotus flower, the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin thus came to the universe known as Enduring
At the very moment he arrived there, all the trees, fruits, flowers, and leaves that existed in Enduring—down to the size of just four finger widths—appeared from Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin’s hand
Moreover, in each of their own languages all beings in Enduring began to speak of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self
They also spoke of the masteries, the powers, the branches of awakening, the concentrations, the liberations , the absorptions, and the attainments
Witnessing all this, the venerable Śāradvatī­putra exclaimed
“Ah, how wondrous that the Thus-Gone One, the Foe-Destroyer, the perfect Buddha performs such miracles!
said the Blessed One
“Śāradvatī­putra,” “these miracles are not of the Thus-Gone One
Śāradvatī­putra, these are the miracles of the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin
Śāradvatī­putra, to the east of this buddha realm, beyond innumerable and countless universes, there is a universe known as Marks of Royal Splendor
Within that universe resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Roar of Signlessness
From the realm where that buddha abides and remains present the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin has arrived
All this appears due to the ripening of that bodhisattva’s past actions.
asked Śāradvatī­putra
“Blessed One,” “which numerous roots of virtue did the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin gather, so that he now, through their ripening, has achieved such mastery?
replied the Blessed One
“Śāradvatī­putra,” “it is excellent that you thought to ask the Thus-Gone One about this matter
Śāradvatī­putra, such eloquence is exclusively due to the power of the Thus-Gone One
Listen, Śāradvatī­putra, I shall explain this to you
When all the blessed buddhas in the past awoke to perfect buddhahood and resided upon the seat of awakening, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin was the one who initially supplicated them and requested them to teach
This is how he accumulated the virtuous roots for unsurpassable and perfect awakening
As he went before them, he would sometimes become Brahmā and so make requests and supplicate
Other times he would do so in the form of Śakra, universal emperors, kings, or sages
“For example, Śāradvatī­putra, when I had first awoken to true and perfect buddhahood
Mahābrahmā invoked and supplicated me, saying, ‘There are beings whose karmic obscurations are minor, who suffer from not having heard the Dharma, and who act in accord with the teachings of the thus-gone ones. Blessed One, please therefore teach the Dharma. Bliss-Gone One, please turn the wheel of Dharma.
Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin has invoked and supplicated all the past buddhas in the same way, requesting them, ‘Please teach the Dharma. Please turn the wheel of Dharma.
All the roots of virtue that he gathered he has dedicated exclusively to the supplication for the turning of the wheel of Dharma
“Śāradvatī­putra, let me provide you with an illustration that establishes this point fully
Within this trichiliocosm a billion suns and moons are in movement. Four billion oceans surround the continents, of which there are likewise four billion. There are seven billion islands, a billion tall surrounding mountains, and a billion inner circles of mountains
Śāradvatī­putra, now imagine that this trichiliocosm becomes like the ocean, eighty-four thousand leagues deep and wide
Imagine then, Śāradvatī­putra, that the thousandfold universe is filled up with sesame seeds, and that some strong, powerful, and diligent person comes by
This person takes up the sesame seeds by the handful and tosses them in the four directions
As the seeds are carried by the wind
each one of them produces an entire universe
Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think
As they thus appear from each sesame seed, how many universes are there?
replied Śāradvatī­putra
“Blessed One,” “there are innumerable universes
Blissful One, there are universes beyond count.
said the Blessed One
“Śāradvatī­putra,” “try to imagine and understand this
Let us say that all these universes that arose from the sesame seeds were to turn into a single city
Imagine that the city reaches as high as it is wide, and tha
it is surrounded by a solid, stable, unbreakable, and indestructible wall
Śāradvatī­putra, now imagine if that great city became a granary, full of grains
Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think
How large would the heap of grains then be?
replied Śāradvatī­putra
“Blessed One, it would be immeasurable,
“Blissful One, it could not be fathomed.
said the Blessed One
“Śāradvatī­putra,” “try to imagine and understand this
It is in fact possible that some mathematicians, or master mathematicians, could calculate the extent of such a mass of grains
Yet the amount of thus-gone ones, residing on the seats of awakening, to whom the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin has paid worship, invoked, and supplicated to turn the wheel of Dharma when they first attained perfect buddhahood is indeed beyond count
And there are even many more blessed buddhas for whom he has prepared and offered a Dharma wheel made of the seven precious substances
And again, compared to that amount, there are far more blessed buddhas to whom he has offered a flower wheel or a wheel of incense without having dedicated it to unsurpassable and perfect awakening
Why then even mention the exquisitely adorned wheels of gold, silver, and wood that he has offered to the blessed buddhas
All such offerings to the blessed buddhas he has dedicated toward the turning of the Dharma wheel, and thus he has supplicated, again and again
“There was a time when the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength appeared in the world
At that time there was a king by the name of Blazing with Famed Power
who reigned as a universal emperor within the trichiliocosm
There, within the retinue of his queens, or residing in his parks, the king would pursue the pleasures of the senses, frolicking and reveling
Yet one time, as he asked his queens to entertain him with song, dance, and music, he instead heard the words of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self
Immediately the king became disenchanted with his pleasures
Having lost his desire, he became frightened and sad, and in such a frame of mind he went before the thus-gone Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength
Having bowed his head to the Thus-Gone One’s feet he took a place before him. “Upon the king’s arrival the Blessed One spoke on roots of virtue from the past, an
as the king listened, he thought
‘The Blessed One sees with wisdom free of any obscuration, an
he has realized roots of virtue for so long
As for myself, compared to him I am not aware of any virtuous roots
Before so many buddhas I have created roots of virtue, yet they were all polluted by the muck of sense pleasures, politics, and power. Thus I did not recognize them, an
I did not dedicate them to awakening. May all the roots of virtue that I now form be dedicated to the welfare of all beings
Throughout all places, realms, and buddha realms, may words be spoken in the languages that beings understand, an
may all beings thus come to hear of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self
In all worlds, may all plants and trees, even the smallest ones, resound with the words of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self, an
may all beings hear those words
May all accumulated roots of virtue cause all beings to equally enter the Great Vehicle with a wisdom that is just like that of the thus-gone Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength.’ “With this understanding King Blazing with Famed Power then rose from his seat
Standing before the Blessed One, he said
“Blessed One, all of my possessions throughout my entire realm I offer, without exception, to the buddhas and so forth, so that the noble saṅgha may partake of them.
“Having made this offering, King Blazing with Famed Power then went forth from his household and became a homeless monk
Moreover, as they heard of the king’s going forth all four divisions of the royal army subsequently also went forth
So did the four billion ladies from the royal harem
Hearing of these goings forth, the townspeople and farmers also went forth
Śāradvatī­putra, in short, there were eight billion people who thus went forth and
as soon as they had done so, they practiced diligently
“Thus, as they all fervently pursued virtuous qualities, it did not take them long to acquire the five superknowledges
In that very life and body they all became able to travel by the power of their superknowledges and miraculous abilities. Traveling east in this way they visited as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges and met as many buddhas. Before each of them they prayed, ‘Blessed One, please teach the Dharma. Blissful One, please turn the wheel of Dharma.
In that same way they also traveled to the south, west, and north, as well as above and below, and in all the intermediate directions. In each of those directions they visited as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges and supplicated as many buddhas, ‘Blessed One, please teach the Dharma. Blissful One, please turn the wheel of Dharma.
“Since then the bodhisattva great being Blazing with Famed Power has never been born in an impure buddha realm, nor has he ever taken birth from a womb
Whenever he visits a buddha realm, all the branches, petals, leaves, trees, and forests within that buddha realm will speak of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and the absence of self
Likewise, in all the worlds that he visits, sentient beings will understand each other’s languages, and they will hear the words of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self
“Thus it was, Śāradvatī­putra, that the universal emperor Blazing with Famed Power once heard the thus-gone Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength teaching on past roots of virtue, and so decided to leave his household to become a homeless monk
Sharing his roots of virtue with all beings
he dedicated them toward unexcelled and perfect awakening. Within that very same body he developed the superknowledges and the power of absorption, and so he journeyed to the east, visiting as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
Visiting as many blessed buddhas, he stood before them, as they resided upon their sacred seat of awakening, invoking and supplicating them to turn the wheel of Dharma
Indeed, in this way he traveled in all the ten directions
Now, Śāradvatī­putra, you should not think that the universal emperor Blazing with Famed Power was someone else
Because, Śāradvatī­putra, he is none other than the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin.
The bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin then proceeded to the city of Rājagṛha and to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana where the Blessed One was residing. Going before him
he bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and took a place in the gathering
Then he addressed the Blessed One with the following words
“Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Roar of Signlessness inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease
And he also sends you this great lotus flower, which I request you to accept.
At this point the Blessed One accepted the lotus flower from the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin and then said to him
“Noble son, does the blessed thus-gone Roar of Signlessness remain strong, healthy, unchanged, and happy within his buddha realm?
“Blessed One,” answered the bodhisattva great being, “the thus-gone Roar of Signlessness remains strong, healthy, unchanged, and happy
And why is that
Because, Blessed One, in that buddha realm pure beings assemble, who are endowed with three factors of purity
What are those three factors
Pure roots of virtue as they are dedicated to the truth, pure boundless discipline due to aspirations, and pure boundless view due to dedication by means of special insight that is not fixed on any phenomenon
Blessed One, in that buddha realm there is not a single being who has a corrupted discipline, view, or comportment
Blessed One, in that buddha realm even the terms for such flaws do not exist
Compared to that world, Blessed One, this world known as Enduring is like a prison filled with murderers, where people are constantly killing each other
Come, Blessed One. Come along to that other world.
In response the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin
“Noble son, why would I go to that world
It is fine to stay in this world, teaching the Dharma to beings here.
Once more the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin called on the Blessed One
“Blessed One, come along. Come along to that world
If, Blessed One, you decline to come along I shall pull you there by the power of my own miraculous abilities and the force of my aspirations
I shall take you through space and into that world.
So that the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin’s powers would be known, and so that sentient beings would engender roots of virtue and become inspired, the Blessed One at this point remained indifferent
Then, as if he had become a potter, or a potter’s apprentice, who is spinning his wheel with a stick so fast that it blurs visual perception, the bodhisattva now transformed the trichiliocosm and lifted it up
As he lifted up the world and shook it, the venerable Śāradvatī­putra cried out to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, the world is moving
Blissful One, the world is moving!
In response, the Blessed One spoke in a way that was delightful, gentle, harmonious, pleasant, compelling, courteous, widely agreeable, profound, comprehensive, instructive, and guided by wisdom
Thus he said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, in this regard I am powerless,” an
he made this known throughout the entire trichiliocosm
Hence, at this point all beings who were attached to, confined to, or dependent on the view of the transitory collection became saddened and weary
All four assemblies saw the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect Buddha, surrounded by bodhisattvas, teaching the Dharma while residing on the Dharma throne like a universal emperor. They saw him as Brahmā, the lord of Enduring, seated upon his Brahmā-throne and surrounded by Brahmā deities, teaching the Dharma
The bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin now also revealed other buddha realms
Then, at this point, the Blessed One performed a miracle
bringing forth a strong swirling wind that caused the buddha realms to touch one another
The worlds became hollow and perforated, so that they fell apart and were destroyed
As the Thus-Gone One performed this miraculous feat, the Brahmās and Mahābrahmās of this world, who had otherwise conceived in terms of views, permanence, and the everlasting, now witnessed the collapse and complete destruction of their Brahmā abodes
It was as if a great mass of water had produced an abundance of bubbles and foam, which a storm then scattered, breaking everything into particles. In this wa
the Brahmā deities witnessed the loss, demolition, and collapse of their abodes
Seeing all this they despaired, an
in despair they all prostrated to and gathered around the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One said to Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, I have explained this before, and I shall now do so again
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is defiled and polluted
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this world is futile and like an illusion, and hence it is like a water bubble that cannot be grasped
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is falsely conceived, and hence it is like a magic trick
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is discerned by the swift thoughts in space, and hence it is like a mirage
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence contains nothing solid to be grasped, and hence it is like a hallucination
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is conjured up by the actions of thought in space, and hence it is like an echo
Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is false and, by realizing that, the Thus-Gone One has attained perfect buddhahood
Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is fake, and so
by not being attached to this world, the Thus-Gone One has attained perfect buddhahood
“Śāradvatī­putra, I have exact knowledge that this worldly existence has no experience to savor, and many shortcomings up to having no emancipation
In this way I have full knowledge of how to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
I have exact knowledge of this world, Śāradvatī­putra, just as I have clear knowledge of its origin and the path that leads to its cessation
At this moment, Śāradvatī­putra, I possess clear knowledge of how to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
“Śāradvatī­putra, you may wonder what the world is
Śāradvatī­putra, the so-called world is the five aggregates
What are those five
They are the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness
Śāradvatī­putra, you may then wonder what is understood by the aggregate of form
Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One has relinquished the aggregate of form in all its past, future, and present manifestations
However, while I have relinquished the aggregate of form in all its past, future, and present manifestations, it would be wrong to say that the sentient beings in the past, future, and present are not the aggregate of form
Śāradvatī­putra, whether inner or outer, large or small, good or bad, distant or close, the Thus-Gone One teaches that all the aggregate of form, as contained within the three times, is devoid of characteristics
As an analogy, just as the aggregate of space possesses the features of wind, water, fire, and earth, the same can be said with respect to the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness
“You may wonder, Śāradvatī­putra, why it is referred to as the aggregate of form 
Śāradvatī­putra, childish, ordinary beings are in darkness
They do not recognize the full extent and nature of the characteristics of form as found in the body
Thus, they think instead, ‘I am form’ or ‘Form is me.
Thus, they cognize and structure things in terms of ‘I.
This produces arrogance and, in turn, craving for things
Yet, Śāradvatī­putra, when the nature of things is known, that is not the case
“Childish, ordinary beings do not comprehend that neither the eye nor form is an entity
Instead, their thoughts are based on holding on to entities that do not exist as such
Childish beings who think in this way thus engage with entities and so take birth within flawed realms
Those who thus experience nonentities, the colorless, that which has no color, are indeed greatly bewildered
Such bewildered beings pursue agriculture, and engage in the use of all sorts of weapons
The factor that conditions them is delusion
“Due to the sameness of things, the Thus-Gone One has a view of sameness. Having thus gained awakening he has formulated the true view
Because that view is equality, it is referred to as the true view 
It is called the true view because it is adhered to by those who are truly diligent and truly liberated
Śāradvatī­putra, the true view that I declare cannot be taught through language
Its teaching is hard to bear
Practice it, Śāradvatī­putra. If you do, you will also be free of darkness
“Śāradvatī­putra, this section of the Dharma is said to be accompanied by eighty-four thousand Dharma teachings
This is the gateway to all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, an
it is the way of all phenomena.
When the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha delivered this teaching of the Dharma, seven hundred and seventy billion beings gained the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees all phenomena
Within the desire realm a billion gods attained this, as did innumerable human beings
Among the billions of such humans who lived on Jambudvīpa, those who were bodhisattvas also gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn
Innumerably many beings set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening
Then the Blessed One withdrew his miraculous activity, an
thus the four assemblies, the Brahmā assembly, the assembly of the gods of the desire realm, as well as the other gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas all saw the world as it is
At this point the venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee
Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin’s mastery of supernatural powers is amazing
Blessed One, he took this world, including the Blessed One himself, and hurled it into another world
At that time I was unable to identify the characteristics and I could not even remember the names of any supernatural powers, so, needless to mention, I was unable to muster any such powers 
Ah, Blessed One, I find it truly amazing that this bodhisattva possesses such supernatural powers
Blessed One, when I carefully scan the changing times I do not recognize even a moment or an instant of such hauling and transportation being performed by any of us
If even a bodhisattva can possess such supernatural powers, then what to say of the powers of the thus-gone ones?
replied the Blessed One
“Maudgalyāyana,” “you should not think that this world was hauled or that the Thus-Gone One was transported
Maudgalyāyana, I do not perceive any mendicant, priest, hearer, or solitary buddha, nor anyone from among the gods up to and including the mahoragas either, who is capable of moving even a fold in the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe
What then to say about actually lifting up the Thus-Gone One
That is clearly impossible
For the time being, Maudgalyāyana, set aside the world with its gods, and imagine instead, Maudgalyāyana, the following scenario
Within the trichiliocosm there are beings with form just as there are formless beings. There are beings involved in perception, beings not involved in perception, and beings neither involved nor not involved in perception. Imagine now that they all achieve a human body, and with that human body they go forth
Having gone forth, they also achieve the state of a worthy one and they gain the six superknowledges
Maudgalyāyana, to illustrate this, imagine that they gain just as great miraculous abilities as the ones you possess
Maudgalyāyana, what do you think
Will that gathering of beings with miraculous abilities then have increased?
replied Maudgalyāyana
“Yes, it will, Blessed One,
“Maudgalyāyana, these hearers may lift up a thousandfold universe, or millionfold universe, or a trichiliocosm, and transport it beyond as many universes as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. Ye
even those who have attained such perfect supernatural powers will not be able to move even a fold in the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe as he resides in the midst of space
“Maudgalyāyana, let us leave aside such a gathering of beings like you
Imagine instead, Maudgalyāyana, that a being has been born who possesses supernatural powers sufficient for conjuring up a storm that can scatter, pulverize, and destroy any trichiliocosm that has not been blessed by a thus-gone one
Imagine then that with each of the particles that thus emerge from one trichiliocosm he further plunges universes into darkness and destroys as many of them as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, and that the particles emerging thereby are scattered throughout trichiliocosms
Maudgalyāyana, what do you think
Would such a being have perfected supernatural power?
answered the venerable Maudgalyāyana
“Yes, Blessed One, he would,
continued the Blessed One
“Maudgalyāyana,” “even if this trichiliocosm were full of such beings with perfect supernatural powers—as many as there are plants on a field of sugar cane, reeds, grass, paddy, or sesame—they would still not be able to move even a fold in the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe
Needless it is to mention, then, that it would be impossible for them to lift up the Thus-Gone One
“Maudgalyāyana, while remaining at this very place, upon this very lion throne, the Thus-Gone One may stir, move, and shake as many innumerable and unfathomable universes in the east as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
Yet the sentient beings there will not think, ‘Our universe is being dislocated and transported!
Neither will they think, ‘Alas, this universe is subject to destruction and formation!
Nor will they think, ‘This universe is being scattered and destroyed!
However, for the sake of taming sentient beings, sometimes forms of the buddhas will teach beings the Dharma beyond marks
but other times forms of hearers, gods, humans, nāgas, boys, or girls will deliver the teaching
“Maudgalyāyana, you must trust in all the different Dharma teachings on the buddhas’ powers, fearlessnesses, unique qualities, and preeminent miracles
This is how it is throughout all the ten directions
----
“Maudgalyāyana, to the monk Ānanda I have taught the gateways for the retention of the sūtras, songs, prophecies, parables, past-life stories, elaborate teachings, marvels, narratives, and established teachings. However
Maudgalyāyana, the monk Ānanda is incapable of understanding the domain of the Thus-Gone One
And why is that
Because, Maudgalyāyana, even if they try for an eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons, or a hundred thousand eons, hearers will not be able to fully understand, conceive of, or comprehend even a single syllable of the Thus-Gone One
What then to say of their understanding of the Thus-Gone One’s full domain
“Maudgalyāyana, the thus-gone ones instruct sentient beings by means of numerous referents, activities, and modes of conduct. In this way, they teach the Dharma to sentient beings. However
Maudgalyāyana, although wearing the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe accomplishes the aims of all beings and spawns the teaching of the Dharma, none of the hearers fully comprehend this
Maudgalyāyana, if you cannot even accommodate this teaching, then how could you possibly grasp the domain of the Thus-Gone One? That is clearly impossible.
Having thus accepted the great lotus flower, the Blessed One next posed questions to Bhadrapāla and all the other bodhisattva great beings, who were guardians of the city of Dharma
“Noble sons, can you protect the treasure of the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma? Can you conceal it? Can you comprehend the full domain of the Thus-Gone One? Can you express it? Can you teach it? Can you teach it in full?
they replied
“Blessed One,” “yes, we can.
continued the Blessed One
“Noble sons,” “you should therefore consider whichever Dharma teaching you give to be the treasure and domain of the thus-gone ones
Noble sons, all that is expressed with respect to the buddhas’ perfect wisdom, the buddhas’ perfect awakening, the buddhas’ accomplishment of wisdom, and the buddhas’ accomplishment of awakening is the domain of the Thus-Gone One. Thus it must be expressed
Noble sons, wherever an objective referent is seen, it is viewed as the Thus-Gone One’s domain and definitively taught to be so
That Dharma teaching by the Thus-Gone One is delivered by viewing the activities of sentient beings, wherever they are seen, as the Thus-Gone One’s domain
Thus, the activities of the Thus-Gone One’s teaching of the Dharma are not displayed for the sake of stopping the activities of sentient beings
“The ninety-nine thousand faculties of the Thus-Gone One’s knowing are as follows: the activities of those engaged in desire, or anger, or delusion; the activities of those engaged in contrived desire, anger, or delusion; the activities of those engaged in desire and anger; the activities of those engaged in contrived desire and anger
the activities of desire and delusion; the activities of those engaged in contrived desire and delusion; the activities of those engaged in anger and delusion; the activities of those engaged in contrived anger and delusion
the faculties for purifying the mind; the faculties for purifying the production of things; the faculties for purifying the production of existence; the faculties that emerge from application
the faculties for purifying activities; the faculties that activate black qualities; the faculties that activate white qualities; the faculties that activate black and white qualities
the faculties that accord with the path; the faculties that accord with tranquility ; the faculties that accord with special insight
the faculties that accord with exhaustion; the faculties that accord with birth; and the faculties that accord with the truth
Maudgalyāyana, in this regard, the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct motivate actions that are either black, or black and white. Such actions produce dark complexion, fair complexion, attractive complexion, unattractive complexion, crippled legs, missing hands or fingers, impaired movement, deafness, blindness, or a missing tongue
The twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct also cause shapes that are long, short, thin, fat, or indistinct
Engaging the faculties of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct are those associated with desire, anger, delusion, absence of desire, absence of anger, or absence of delusion
The thirty thousand faculties that produce birth activate the time of death
They become apparent when they create changes or signs
such as shaking of the limbs, changes in one’s faculties, bones breaking, or deterioration of the vital signs, which in turn causes loss of one’s luster. These signs finally stop when the voice is choked
Such faculties lead to the realms of hell, animals, or starving spirits
To attain buddhahood one is led to birth among humans, gods, or within different worlds. Or one is led to actualize the exhaustion of defilements
There are seventy-seven thousand faculties that should be considered if one is interested in the features of roots of virtue
There are twenty thousand faculties that lead to roots of nonvirtue and these should be known to facilitate death
The treasure of the thus-gone ones is the domain of the thus-gone ones
Dwelling within that domain the Thus-Gone One explains the Dharma without ever tiring or running out of things to say.
This concludes the second chapter
Present in the gathering was a certain Dṛḍhamati­kumāra­bhūta, who now rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee
Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, with this gateway of the Dharma I have discovered something very precious
Blessed One, I shall henceforth practice this gateway of the Dharma in order to accomplish the Dharma
How so
From today on, Blessed One, I shall don a suitable armor to pursue and accomplish these Dharma teachings
In the future, in times to come, I shall never let my diligence wane until I have listened to the Dharma treasure of the Thus-Gone One’s domain.
replied the Thus-Gone One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “this is excellent. It is excellent that throughout innumerable millions of eons you will continue to exert yourself in the pursuit of the practice of my great wisdom
Well done, Dṛḍhamati
Now, Dṛḍhamati, imagine that all at once, in one moment, in one instant, all beings in this trichiliocosm without exception—whether they are those with form, or those who are formless, and whether they are those with perception, or those without perception, or those with neither perception nor non-perception—were to attain a human body
Then imagine that a man appears who provides all those beings with enjoyable things
He is able to lift them up and hold them by his hand for an eon or more, faithfully providing them with whatever forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures they might wish for
Meanwhile, he uses his other hand to collect all the feces and urine of all those beings, depositing it all in a different universe
And why does he do that
Because he does not want any of them to experience any unpleasant odor
Dṛḍhamati, what do you think
Does that man render proper service to all those beings, providing them with desirable things?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Indeed, Blessed One,” “he serves them with an extremely vast amount of enjoyable things.
continued the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “that man serves each of those beings, providing them with pleasant things
“Now think of a noble son or daughter who, regardless of whether the Thus-Gone One is present or has passed beyond suffering, develops the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening for the sake of all beings
This person wishes to hear the teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection
He or she is intent on accomplishing the wisdom of the buddhas, the great wisdom, thus eliminating desire, anger, and delusion. So that all beings may go beyond birth, aging, sickness, death, lamentation, suffering, mental pain, and disturbance, this person pledges to teach the Dharma to sentient beings
When thus involved in the process of maturing a bodhisattva’s roots of virtue, that person may search for the Dharma and find just one single verse
Dṛḍhamati, as that person provides delightful service to sentient beings, he or she creates merit that is much larger than the former person’s merit. The former merit would not even match one hundredth, or one thousandth of that
In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice
“Dṛḍhamati, the Thus-Gone One is clearly aware of the different ways in which bodhisattva great beings provide delightful service to sentient beings
But who can trust this, Dṛḍhamati, apart from my hearers who have seen the truths, or the bodhisattva great beings with their superior intent
“Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattva great beings feel, ‘We shall be the support of those who have no support, the savior of those who have no savior, the refuge of those who have no refuge, the protector of those who have no protector
We shall accomplish the wisdom of the buddhas, the great wisdom, and lead sentient beings beyond all limits and numbers to the undefiled qualities.
Such is the armor that they wear
“It may then be that in the morning they must provide sentient beings with a heap of jewels as large as Mount Meru, an
it may be that they have to do the same at noon, and in the afternoon, or throughout the day and night
However, beings may still not be satisfied an
the gifts may thus become a circumstance for their depravation. In that cas
bodhisattvas will think, ‘We shall pursue the Dharma whereby sentient beings will consider the entire trichiliocosm filled with precious substances to be like a glob of spit.
Needless then to mention what their perception of vile substances will be like
“Wise bodhisattva great beings will think, ‘This heap of jewels is the root of desire, anger, and delusion; the root of the sufferings of hell, animals, and hungry spirits; and the root of numerous karmic manifestations.’ Starting out in this way, they attain the mind of transcendence of suffering and have no concern for any heap of jewels
In fact, wise beings do not consider heaps of jewels to be just that. Instead
they see them as heaps of beings in hell
because they understand that anyone who develops attachment to such things will fall into misery
“Now, Dṛḍhamati, let us no longer consider just all the beings within a single trichiliocosm
Imagine instead the following
Think of all the universes that extend toward the east, as abundant as the grains of sand in the river Ganges. And then think of all the universes that in the same way extend in each of the ten directions. Within all these universes are beings with bodies, beings without bodies, beings who are involved in perception, beings who are not involved in perception, and beings neither involved nor not involved in perception. Think of all that we in this way call ‘the realms of sentient beings.’ Then imagine that, all at once, each one gains a human body
Imagine also that a man appears who always immediately provides them with whatever they might wish for in terms of enjoyable forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures
For an eon or more, that man takes care of all these beings, carrying them on his shoulders and head
Whatever they wish him to do, he does. And
with one hand he sweeps away all these beings’ excrement and urine, disposing of it all in a different universe
Well, Dṛḍhamati, what do you think
Does that man render proper service to those beings, providing them with numerous desirable things?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Indeed, Blessed One, he serves them with a vast amount of enjoyable things.
continued the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “pay attention and understand what I say
That man serves all those beings, providing them with pleasant things
But think now of a noble son or daughter who wishes to provide all beings with refuge, and so sets his or her mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
This person wishes to listen to the teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection, the teachings whereby bodhisattvas’ roots of virtue ripen into unexcelled and perfect awakening, and may therefore diligently pursue the Dharma of the bodhisattvas
If, Dṛḍhamati, that person takes even just a single step toward the pursuit and diligent practice of the bodhisattva Dharma, then the ensuing roots of virtue will not wear out or come to an end before the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening
And why
Dṛḍhamati, the former person’s way of providing delightful service cannot match even one hundredth, or a thousandth, one hundred thousandth, or a millionth part of what is rendered by the latter. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice
And why
Because, Dṛḍhamati, all of the former type of service is based on substance, and hence is limited and imperfect
“Dṛḍhamati, diligent pursuit of the Dharma causes an increase in discipline, absorption, and insight
It ripens the qualities of buddhahood
It ripens inconceivable skillful means and purifies buddha realms
Hence, the Thus-Gone One has taught that unexcelled and perfect awakening depends on abundant learning
“Dṛḍhamati, imagine that this trichiliocosm is full of thus-gone ones—as full as a grove of reeds, a paddy field, a sesame field, or a bamboo grove
Imagine then that someone spends his or her entire life paying respect to, honoring, venerating, and worshiping all those thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas, offering them garments, foods, bedding, mattresses, medicines, and other material things
Moreover, if any one of those thus-gone ones passes completely beyond suffering that person will construct a memorial for them that measures a league in circumference, is made of the seven precious substances, is sheltered below parasols, is adorned with altars, shines for an eon with the blazing light of oil lamps, and is adorned with beautiful offerings
Dṛḍhamati, what do you think
Will such a noble son or daughter engender abundant merit?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Blessed One, that person will produce merit beyond number and measure,
“Dṛḍhamati,” said the Blessed One, “try to imagine and understand this
That person indeed accumulates such merit
However, a noble son or daughter may develop the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening, and so diligently seek to listen to, teach, read, and master the sūtra teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection, the teachings that ripen the factors of awakening
In this regard, Dṛḍhamati, the heaps of merit that are acquired by the former person cannot match even one hundredth, or a thousandth, a hundred thousandth, or a billionth part of the mass of merit that is achieved by this latter person. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice
“Therefore, Dṛḍhamati, if you intend to don your armor for the sake of listening to, recollecting, reading, and mastering such sūtras in the future, during the final five hundred years, then, Dṛḍhamati, I shall not state any measure regarding the amount of merit that you will obtain
I shall mention neither limits nor an end to it
“Dṛḍhamati, if you wish to hear an analogy for the amount of merit that is obtained by developing the awakened mind, or if you wish to gain just a sense of what it is like, the
let me ask you whether you have heard of the thus-gone ones’ supernatural powers, and if you are capable of believing in them.
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Blessed One,” “I can accept the powers of the Blessed One.
asked the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “what do you think
Is the trichiliocosm large?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Blessed One, yes it is,
asked the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “what do you think
What if the trichiliocosm were full of sesame seeds, and each of those sesame seeds itself became a container the size of a trichiliocosm, all filled up with sand
Dṛḍhamati, what do you think
Would all that amount to a large pile of sand?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Yes, Blessed One,” “it would.
continued the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “what then if a man appeared who would grab handfuls of this sand and toss it in the four directions, and if, whenever he did so, a wind would catch each individual grain of sand and carry it into its own distinct universe
Dṛḍhamati, what do you think
How many worlds would there be in the east, an
how many would there be in the other directions?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Blessed One, this would be beyond measure,
“Blissful One, it would be beyond measure.
continued the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati, try to imagine
Dṛḍhamati, try to understand,
“Dṛḍhamati, in the case of the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas, their conduct, path, transcendent discipline, transcendent miraculous abilities, and transcendent insight are all beyond measure
Dṛḍhamati, if he so wishes, a thus-gone one may traverse all those universes in a single step, and ye
neither will his conduct be rushed
nor will he have displayed the full extent of his transcendent, supernatural powers
Within the time of a finger-snap and with just one single step a thus-gone one can walk across all those universes—one universe for each grain of sand
He can do so in the east, as well as in all the rest of the ten directions, an
he can do so for a day, a fortnight, a month, a year, a hundred years, a thousand years, or a hundred thousand years
He can walk throughout each direction for a hundred billion years
Well, Dṛḍhamati, would you say that the worlds that can thus be crossed by a thus-gone one are many?
replied Dṛḍhamati
“Yes, Blessed One, they are many,
continued the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “if such merit had form it could not even be contained within all those universes
It would be even larger
Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas know all these heaps of merit completely
Such merits are beyond measure, innumerable, limitless, ineffable, and beyond count, and yet the thus-gone one knows them completely
Dṛḍhamati, I am not aware of any number of syllables, or any number of letters, or any number of digits that can convey the knowledge of such heaps of merit
In the end there would be nothing but innumerable numbers, numbers beyond measure.
This concludes the third chapter
At that time there was in the east—beyond countless and limitless universes—a world known as Sound of Renown. Within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Majestic Mountain
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Majestic Mountain had just prophesied that following himself the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor, who was present in the gathering there, would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
The bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor had witnessed the great light, heard the special sound, and sensed the ground quaking
Now he approached the blessed thus-gone Majestic Mountain and asked
“Blessed One, who is behind this light, this special sound, and the ground shaking?
The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Majestic Mountain then said to the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor
“Noble son, to the west of this buddha realm, far beyond countless and limitless universes, there is a world known as Enduring
There resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering Dharma teachings on the Bodhisattva Collection to a retinue that contains incomparable bodhisattva beings
Noble son, in the ten directions, throughout universes as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Ganges, there is nobody who wears an armor as strong as the one that is borne by those holy beings
Noble son, even coming to hear of these beings is extremely difficult, let alone beholding and venerating them.
said the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor
“Blessed One,” “I wish to go to that world known as Enduring, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, and so that I may see those bodhisattva great beings who bear such inconceivable armor.
“Noble son, if you know that the time has come, then go,” replied the blessed Majestic Mountain
“Offer that blessed one these seven lotus flowers, an
tell him that the blessed thus-gone Majestic Mountain inquires whether he has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease.
The bodhisattva great being Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor then looked at the thus-gone Majestic Mountain
He bowed his head to the Thus-Gone One’s feet and then left
As fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor now disappeared from that universe and instantaneously appeared here in the world of Enduring
Arriving at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha he went before the Blessed One
He bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side
Then he addressed the Blessed One
“Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Majestic Mountain inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease
He also sends you these lotus flowers.
The Blessed One accepted the flowers and asked
“Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor, is that blessed one free from ailments? Is he strong and does he remain unchanged and happy?
replied Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor
“Yes, Blessed One,
“he is free from ailments and strong. He remains unchanged and happy within his buddha realm.
The Blessed One now gave the lotus flowers to the bodhisattva Ajita and said, “Ajita, so that you may perfect the branches of awakening, take these lotuses and use them to engender roots of virtue.
The bodhisattva Ajita, receiving thus the seven great lotus flowers, in turn passed them on to Bhadrapāla and other such incomparable bodhisattvas

Thus, in all, seventy-seven thousand bodhisattvas received the seven lotus flowers. The Blessed One said, “Elders, the Blessed One gives you these seven lotuses so that you may bring the factors of awakening to maturation
Noble sons, take these great flowers, transform them, and offer them to the Blessed One
As you transform the flowers, display your individual skillful means.
Thus, when the seventy-seven thousand bodhisattvas had taken the seven lotus flowers, they offered them to the Blessed One, so that they could each display their skillful means
With great love the Blessed One accepted the seven great lotuses, and then said to the bodhisattva great being Ajita
“Ajita, the Thus-Gone One has practiced diligently so that you may give rise to roots of virtue
He has practiced with supreme diligence
Ajita, a thus-gone one, a blessed one, a perfect buddha is extremely difficult to find, supremely difficult to find
Ajita, bodhisattvas are also extremely difficult to find
And why
Because, Ajita, buddha qualities manifest from bodhisattva activity
Ajita, would I now possess the ten powers of a thus-gone one if I had not earlier aroused the mind of awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, you would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the four types of fearlessness be present now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“Blessed One, they would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the great love of the Thus-Gone One be present in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, it would not be present,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the great compassion of the Thus-Gone One be present in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
Or would there be any great joy, or great equanimity?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, there would be none of these,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would there be any of the eighteen unique qualities of the Buddha in the world now, if I had not earlier, when I was engaged in bodhisattva activity, set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, there would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would any of the Thus-Gone One’s meaningful strides be manifest in the world now, if I had not earlier, when I was engaged in bodhisattva activity, set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, they would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Could the lion’s gait of the Thus-Gone One be witnessed in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, it could not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the Thus-Gone One’s elephant gaze be manifest in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, it would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the lion-like posture of the Thus-Gone One be seen in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, it would not be,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the Thus-Gone One’s indiscernible crown protuberance appear in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, it would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would any of the thirty-two marks of a great being be perceptible in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, there would be none,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would I turn the wheel of Dharma in the world now, if had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, you would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would the conch of Dharma be present in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“Blessed One, it would not,
asked the Blessed One
“Ajita,” “what do you think
Would there be perfect hearers in the world now, if I had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening?
replied Ajita
“No, Blessed One, there would not,
the Blessed One continued
“Thus, Ajita,” “each and every element of awakening depends on the initial engendering of that mind
Ajita, the reason there are so few thus-gone ones is that bodhisattvas are so rare
Ajita, consider this analogy. If there were no butter there would no longer be any clarified butter. Likewise
Ajita, if the mind is not set on awakening one will never become a thus-gone one
Ajita, consider this analogy. When there is butter there is also an uninterrupted supply of clarified butter. Similarly
Ajita, when there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thus-gone ones
Ajita, consider this analogy. When there is a seed there can also be a sprout. Likewise, Ajita, if there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thus-gone ones
Ajita, the reason thus-gone ones are so rare is therefore precisely because bodhisattvas are rare
“Ajita, consider this analogy. Compared to the priceless jewels in the ocean, there is a greater number of valuable jewels in general. Similarly
among sentient beings there are only a few who abide by the mind of awakening
In comparison, those who keep the mindset of a hearer or a solitary buddha are so many
“Thus, Ajita, those who give rise to the mind of awakening are rare. They are extremely rare
Being so extremely rare, they are like the uḍumbara flower
Those who engender the mind of awakening are priceless, like priceless jewels
Those who engender the mind of awakening are greatly superior, like Mount Meru
Those who engender the mind of awakening are utterly unmoving, like space
Those who engender the mind of awakening are deep, like the ocean
“Ajita, those who engender the mind of awakening surpass a trichiliocosm filled with precious jewels
Ajita, when those who engender the mind of awakening have a physical form they are worthy of homage, and
Ajita, they will be protected by hundreds of thousands of mundane beings—gods and others
Therefore, Ajita, persist in the practice of engendering the awakened mind. Do so joyfully, forcefully, clearly, boldly, and with commitment
“Ajita, you may then wonder what it means to engender the mind of awakening
Arousing the mind of awakening is not something that can be counted or measured
Nevertheless, Ajita, for the sake of comprehension I shall give you just an illustration, just a single example
Long ago in the past, before limitless and innumerable eons, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone wise and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman taming beings, an unsurpassable one, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha by the name of King of Bliss
Ajita, the lifespan of that blessed one was eighty-four thousand years
Ajita, the first assembly of that blessed one’s hearers numbered seven hundred sixty million
The second assembly contained nine hundred sixty million, and the third one billion hearers
Without exception, they were all foe-destroyers who had brought an end to defilement, completed their task, completed their work, laid down the load, achieved their own objectives, exhausted the bonds to existence, and achieved liberation through the mind of equality
At that time there was a royal palace known as Immense Vista, and within that palace resided a king of royal descent who had received anointment. He was known by the name of Lion Glory, an
his eminent queen gave birth to two twin boys, one named Aśoka and the other Vigataśoka
“Ajita, one day in the palace, when the two boys had grown to be seven years old, they saw the thus-gone King of Bliss enter the royal palace together with a gathering of hearers
The boy Aśoka then asked his brother, 
Vigataśoka , do you see the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect buddha King of Bliss, as he approaches from afar?
replied Vigataśoka
“ ‘Yes, brother, I see him,
continued Aśoka 
“ ‘ Vigataśoka ,’ ‘I want to become just like the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect buddha King of Bliss.
Prince Aśoka then spoke the following verses to his brother
“ ‘Behold the protector, supreme among humans, As he heads the saṅgha of monks, Leading them here. Vigataśoka , watch King of Bliss
“ ‘The one thing I must do is to become Just such a perfect leader of men
I shall engender the mind of awakening And liberate beings from fear
“ ‘Through craving, conceit, anger, and desire The world engages in painful acts
Through such acts they fall into the abyss of hell
Yet I shall free them from the lower realms
“ ‘I shall be the world’s guide. Like the uḍumbara flowers of the world, This is the rarest of the rare.’ This is the wish you should make.
“In reply, his brother Vigataśoka spoke the following verses
“ ‘Even if words are many They do not make things happen
I remain in practice And say nothing at all
“ ‘If, despite so much talking, The body does nothing
It is all fruitless, And the words become lies
“ ‘If words would make things happen People would shine like a jewel
Although their good qualities decrease, They declare themselves to be supreme.
“Young Aśoka then spoke these verses to his brother Vigataśoka
“ ‘It is for the sake of oneself, and not others, That one would say such things
Therefore, if one does not say anything at all One’s mind is suffering from stinginess
“ ‘I invite sentient beings to be my guests
I shall delight them
For me there is no stinginess to get rid of
May I be the guide of living beings
“ ‘The wise ones of the past Did not say such things
Some speak at great length But do not act accordingly
“ ‘Such people were also Stingy in the past
Hence they wonder Whether things are actually going to happen.
“Young Vigataśoka then spoke again to his brother in verse
“ ‘Brother, we should go together To ask the Protector Whether your way of developing The mind of awakening, or mine, is the greatest.
“Young Vigataśoka then descended from the upper story of the palace and
wearing sandals made of jewels and garments worth millions
he went to the place where the thus-gone King of Bliss was residing
There he bowed his head to the thus-gone one’s feet and took a place in the gathering
Young Aśoka , on the other hand, jumped from the upper story, and in this way went before the thus-gone King of Bliss
He also wore precious garments, and he carried a jewel as his crown ornament
But as he arrived, Aśoka offered his garments and jewel to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One accepted those gifts from the boy’s hand
“In this way, young Vigataśoka in fact arrived in the Blessed One’s presence later than young Aśoka , who had gotten there much earlier
When Vigataśoka noticed young Aśoka in the gathering around the thus-gone King of Bliss he asked him
‘ Aśoka , which way did you take to have arrived here before the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect buddha King of Bliss so much earlier?
replied Aśoka 
“ ‘Brother,’ ‘I jumped from our palace to this place where the Blessed One resides
Without any harm or injury to my body, I got here with great convenience.
“When he had heard young Aśoka ’s reply, young Vigataśoka offered his sandals and precious garments to the Blessed One and spoke the following verse
“ ‘May we not take inferior paths, But behold the guide of the world
May we always follow The path taught by the buddhas.
“In verse, young Aśoka then addressed his brother
“ ‘People who protect Their bodies and lives Are constantly looking for the path
Brother, you are just like such people
“ ‘Those always in pursuit of happiness Do not pursue the happiness of others
When they leave their present body and life They come to suffer in numerous ways
“ ‘We must be of great service to people And liberate them from the web of suffering
That very path leads to seeing buddhahood. When buddhahood is seen one will no longer search for the path
“ ‘ “We shall take the path that leads to happiness.” Thus think ignorant and unwise people
Yet they proceed on such inferior paths
They do not know the true path
“ ‘Those traveling inferior paths while thinking of the ultimate Proceed along paths of misfortune. Tied up by the demons as they are, Such people are far from this supreme path
“ ‘May we always meet with buddhas
May we always wear the ochre colors
May we always observe pure conduct
May our lives be extremely beneficial to others
“ ‘May we always abide by the practice of the sacred Dharma
May we always uphold the Dharma
May we retain the Dharma of all the victorious ones forever
May we always do good to living beings
“ ‘May we constantly foster steadfast diligence
May we never let the words we hear be wasted
May our equipoise be constant
And may we forever be adorned with all excellent qualities.
“Ajita, when young Aśoka and young Vigataśoka had spoken these verse
they both went forth from their homes to become monks under the thus-gone King of Bliss
As soon as they had gone forth, each one of them claimed that he would become a thus-gone one much earlier than the other
The monk Aśoka then asked the monk Vigataśoka 
‘What sort of mindset have you aroused, since you claim that you will be the first to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?
replied Vigataśoka 
“ ‘ Aśoka ,’ ‘I think in this way: until I have awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, I shall never give up the mind of awakening, even if I must bring every single being to maturation by remaining in hell for a hundred thousand eons
Such is the quality of the mind that I bring forth
Aśoka , even if people come from the east, and from all the other directions, and place upon my head piles of feces, fire, or dirt, or a pot of excrement, fire, or dirt
I shall not allow that to make me angry and lose my temper
I shall not scowl angrily at such people
nor shall I speak spitefully of revenge
Instead, I shall practice the perfections for the sake of those very people who attack me
Therefore, all their acts serve only to generate the wisdom of the buddhas
All their acts serve only to engender the qualities of the buddhas
If I, in the face of such abuse, were to abandon my equipoise, the
how would I be able to accomplish the perfection of patience
What should be extraordinary about this, if such circumstances for ill will would not come up
Therefore, in order to mature those very beings and cause them to pass beyond suffering, I shall don my armor. Thinking in this way, I bear the armor of patience
If, when such beings seek to harm me, I attempt to retaliate, then how would I be any better than them
Aśoka , such is the armor that I bear.
“The monk Aśoka then said to the monk Vigataśoka 
‘Brother, have you seen that mind of yours, which bears such armor?
“The monk Vigataśoka replied
‘If there were no mind there would not be any donning of such armor either
If there were no armor, then neither could it be shown
Aśoka , because there is mind the armor can also be shown.
“The monk Aśoka then told the monk Vigataśoka 
‘You must not say “Just as there is mind there is also armor”
And why not
Because, Vigataśoka , the mind is subject to arising and destruction, and is therefore like an illusion
And an illusory mind that is subject to arising and destruction is neither there nor not there
Vigataśoka , a view is involved whether something is there or not, and any such view of presence or absence is a wrong view
Whenever there is wrong view, one is on an errant path, a wrong path
One is not on the path of awakening, and hence one is far from awakening, not near it
Reaching awakening will be hard
“ ‘Therefore, Vigataśoka , all that is mental construction
Anything that involves mental construction and conceit is not something for a bodhisattva to rely on
What, then, should a bodhisattva rely on
A bodhisattva should not rely on anything
And why not
Because if one relies on something, one does not properly rely
Thus, a bodhisattva should not be attached to anything
And why not
Because awakening is baseless
And should a bodhisattva conceptualize this, that would not be right
Why not
Because awakening is beyond concepts
If a bodhisattva should become fixed on this, that would not be right
Why not
Because awakening is beyond fixation
Should a bodhisattva think in such ways, that would not be right
Why not
Because awakening knows no concepts
If a bodhisattva determines this, that would not be right
Why not
Because awakening has no characteristics
If a bodhisattva comprehends this, that would not be right
And why not
Because awakening does not change
Should a bodhisattva believe that there is something to actualize
that would not be right
And why not
Because there is no awakening and because awakening is beyond syllables.
“The monk Vigataśoka then said to the monk Aśoka 
‘ Aśoka , why should there not be any awakening
Let me explain
Vigataśoka is here and, since I am here, there is also awakening.
replied the monk Aśoka 
“ ‘Brother,’ ‘please do not think that nonconceptual awakening either exists or does not exist
And why
Because as long as there are concepts there is no awakening
And why
Because awakening does not involve any concepts
This is how it is
Or, in other words, the more constructs, the more awakening.
said Vigataśoka 
“ ‘Brother’ ‘I do not understand what you mean by saying “the more constructs, the more awakening.” 
“The monk Aśoka then said to his brother
‘Brother, for that reason let us together go before the blessed thus-gone King of Bliss.
“The two of them then went to the place where the blessed thus-gone King of Bliss was residing
Having bowed their heads to his feet, they sat to one side, an
from there they conveyed their entire conversation to the Blessed One
In response, the Blessed One expressed his approval to the one monk, saying, ‘Excellent, Aśoka .
“The blessed one then turned to Vigataśoka and said
‘ Vigataśoka , this is how it is
The more constructs, the more awakening
Why
Because all constructs are void, and so is awakening
What then is voidness
Voidness is a construct
And what are constructs
They are thought
That is to say, there are the constructs of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness; the constructs of discipline and absorption; the constructs of few desires and contentment; and the constructs of being easily satisfied and being distinct
Where do constructs come from
They come from thinking, that is to say, from the thought of form to the thought of absorption—each thought is construction
Whatever is thought has no form, and thus thinking is not something with form
That which is thought is absence of thought
That which is thought is neither discipline nor anything else, up to and including contentment
And awakening is the emptiness of form
Awakening is the emptiness of feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness
So also with discipline, absorption, few desires, contentment, being easily satisfied, and being easily nourished—all are emptiness
And emptiness is neither sameness nor difference
That, precisely, is what awakening is.
“When the monk Vigataśoka heard this teaching of the Dharma he gained the acceptance that phenomena do not arise
He also clearly understood what kind of mind makes someone a bodhisattva; he understood what the mind of awakening is
In this way the monks Aśoka and Vigataśoka developed special insight into, and clear knowledge of, all phenomena. With such conviction about all phenomena they persisted diligently, without any weariness or sleepiness, for eighty thousand years
whereas before they had always been involved in nothing but the pursuit of their desires
Thus, they did not give rise to any desire, anger, or dullness
Upon their death and passing, their next birth in the world took place in the buddha realm known as Harmony with a Thousand Buddha Realms , the realm of the thus-gone Saṃvṛtta­skandha, an
there they continued their diligent pursuits
“Ajita, in this way those two bodhisattvas went on to serve six hundred and eighty million buddhas, an
in each life they lived they would always go forth and practice diligently
Then, finally, the bodhisattva great being Aśoka awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and appeared in the world as the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha known as Array of the Perfect Assembly
After that the bodhisattva Vigataśoka awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and he became the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha known as Supreme Accumulations 
Ajita, the teachings of those two became extremely vast
Ajita, the lifespans of those two thus-gone ones were unfathomably long
“Ajita, the mind of a bodhisattva is not transferred anywhere, nor is it adopted in any way
It cannot be engendered and it cannot be stopped. It does not abide
It cannot be interrupted. It does not come and it does not go
Ajita, that mind, as well as the bodhisattva, is supremely difficult to find.
Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses
“Throughout millions of eons, The world illuminators are so rare
Like the flowers of the uḍumbara, They appear in the world only sometimes
“Also, bodhisattvas who practice In pursuit of awakening are rare
The hero’s mind Will manifest in the world only sometimes
“Thus, the ones who bring forth Such an extremely pure mind Will witness the powers of a buddha As well as the types of fearlessness
“They will roar like a lion, And declare the speech of the sage
As I turn the wheel of truth, They will turn the wheel of Dharma
“My eighteen unique qualities, Complete without anything lacking, As well as all the marks of the buddhas, You must look here to see them
“The movements free from delusion, The elephant’s gaze, And the imperceptible crown— All must all be seen through that mind
“Transcendent discipline, Transcendent meditative absorption, Transcendent insight, as well as the mind of awakening, Are all to be seen through this
“All buddha qualities And any other qualities taught Reside, without exception, within that mind, And within its initial arousal
“The discipline of the hearers, The absorptions of the hearers, And their insight and miraculous ability— You must see them all here
“If you do not engage The mind that you earlier brought forth, The
how will you ever be able To engage the unexcelled wisdom
“If the buddha qualities are not seen, Then how could there be any hearing
The hearers then could not possibly Appear within the world
“The armor of the virtues Of suffering’s transcendence, Just as it is borne by the perfect, solitary buddhas— Also that you must see through this mind
“All the happiness of sentient beings, Whether mundane or transcendent, Resides without exception within this mind, And within the initial mind
“That mind’s ripening Is vast, and it is said that once seen It will not wear out, Even over billions of eons
“Arising and ceasing, The mind is brought forth by conditions
Watch the ripening Of its empty nature
“The mind is produced by conditions But the mind itself is not an entity
Watch the ripening By the mind that is devoid of any entity
“Based on what is apprehended The mind never arises, Ye
watch the ripening of that Which is praised for never decaying
“How could a person of steadfast mind, Who clearly understands such a mind And constantly remains within the true vehicle, Ever be lost
“There are those who remain Fixed on eye and form, As well as feeling, perception, and formation, And who do not know their own nature
“Such miserable minds that believe That by thinking they can purify space, Will for long not experience any purification, And so they will remain, unskilled, within existence
“Therefore, the mind is false and fake
Having understood that it does not exist
Do not ascribe to it any importance
For it is devoid of any essence
“The mind that arises in dependence Will never come to nothing
Yet all its conditions Are empty of their own essence
“Phenomena empty of their own essence Are not to be accomplished
All phenomena are imaginary
This is how their nature is taught
“Those who understand this clearly Receive the prophecy of awakening
Their prophecy is not delivered by means of form, Nor does it take place in terms of feeling
“Prophecy does not occur through perception or formation, Nor is it granted by means of consciousness
Here no phenomena are observed, Yet neither do such beings lack prophecy
“Those who recognize that here All phenomena are devoid of marks, And who are free from arrogance based on such understanding, They receive the prophecy of awakening
“Such acceptance has arisen Through precisely the teaching of intelligence
As dirt is broken, weapons are broken, And thus they will not be subject to forgetfulness
“Whoever truly develops An acceptance of this kind Will be able to endure wealth and honor
Remaining free from conceit based on riches
“An acceptance of this kind Is undertaken by the wise
Having subdued the two extremes The wise practice by means of the middle
“Hence, one must develop firm acceptance
Phenomena are devoid of essence— This is the path of awakening Upon which I have also relied.
This concludes the fourth chapter
At that time there was in the east, beyond sixty-eight thousand innumerable universes, a universe known as Susthitamati , and within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Sky Family
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
This blessed one had prophesied that a bodhisattva great being by the name of Candra would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
Also this bodhisattva great being, Candra, had noticed the light and heard the sound of the clear voice
Now he approached the perfect buddha Sky Family and asked
“Blessed One, whose is this clear voice that we hear, and to whom does this radiance belong?
replied the blessed thus-gone Sky Family
“Noble son,” “sixty-eight thousand innumerable universes away from this buddha realm lies a universe known as Enduring
Within it resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering Dharma teachings that are known as the Bodhisattva Collection
The clear voice and radiant light both belong to that blessed one.
the bodhisattva Candra then declared
“Blessed One,” “I shall travel to Enduring and go before the blessed Śākyamuni.
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time has come, then go.
Having been granted permission
the bodhisattva Candra looked toward that blessed one, bowed his head to that blessed one’s feet in homage, and prepared to leave
The blessed thus-gone Sky Family then gave a hand-like kumuda flower to the bodhisattva Candra and said
“Noble son, offer this hand-like kumuda flower to the Blessed One
Tell him that the thus-gone one Sky Family inquires whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease.
“Very well,” agreed the bodhisattva Candra, and so he left
In an instant, as fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, the bodhisattva Candra arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha
Going before the Blessed One, he bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet in homage and then sat to one side
From there he addressed the Blessed One
“Blessed One, the thus-gone one Sky Family inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease
He also sends you this hand-like kumuda flower.
The Blessed One received the hand-like kumuda from the bodhisattva Candra and asked
“Candra, has that blessed one encountered but little harm, is he strong and happy, and does he remain unchanged and well?
answered the bodhisattva
“Indeed,” “that is how it is.
At that time there was in the east, beyond forty thousand innumerable universes, a universe known as Kṣitigarbha, an
within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as the buddha King of Renowned Power
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
This blessed one had prophesied that a bodhisattva great being by the name of Wisdom Renown would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
Also this bodhisattva great being, Wisdom Renown, had noticed the light and heard the sound of the clear voice
Now the bodhisattva Wisdom Renown went before the perfect buddha, King of Renowned Power, an
having bowed his head to his feet, he asked
“Whose is this clear voice that we hear, and to whom does this radiance belong?
replied the blessed thus-gone King of Renowned Power
“Noble son,” “forty thousand innumerable universes away from this buddha realm lies a world known as Enduring
Within it resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering Dharma teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection that satisfy the wishes of all sentient beings.
said the bodhisattva
“Blessed One,” “I wish to go to that world, so that I may see, venerate, and serve that blessed one, and so that I may behold the incomparable bodhisattvas.
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time has come, then leave.
Thus, having been granted permission
the bodhisattva Wisdom Renown bowed to that blessed one and prepared to journey to Enduring
The thus-gone King of Renowned Power then gave him a bundle of red sandalwood and said

Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
This blessed one had prophesied that a bodhisattva known as Unimpeded Armor would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
Why, one might wonder, was this universe known as Lamp Maker
In that universe there were innumerable great and vast pools of utpalas, kumudas, and white lotuses
Whenever a lotus flower would open and unfold its thousand petals, it would shine a light reaching eighty thousand leagues into the sky, an
each petal of the lotuses would shine with a hundred thousand light rays, radiating above, below, and in all directions
That universe was of a checkered design and adorned with jewel garlands and jewel threads
In each of the squares grew jewel trees that reached a height of seventy-seven thousand leagues. To the sides the trees would extend their branches, twigs, and leaves, spanning a distance of eighty-four thousand leagues, an
on each tree grew eight hundred million jewels
In that buddhafield there were trees of this kind beyond number and count
All the lotus petals and jewels would shine with a constant brilliance, and yet their light was eclipsed by that of the Blessed One
Now, the bodhisattva Unimpeded Armor had also noticed the great light and heard the sound of the clear voice
He therefore went before the blessed one Numerous Manifestations and asked
“Blessed One, whose is this radiance and clear voice?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “in the west, beyond a thousand innumerable universes, lies a universe known as Enduring
Within it resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering the Dharma teachings that are known as the Bodhisattva Collection
What you witness is his power.
The bodhisattva then said to that blessed one
“Blessed One, I wish to go to that universe so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni.
The blessed thus-gone Numerous Manifestations then placed a great lotus flower in the bodhisattva Unimpeded Armor’s hand and said
“Noble son, offer this to the Blessed One, an
inquire with him appropriately on my behalf.
Thus, having received his permission, the bodhisattva bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one
As fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, he disappeared from that world and arrived at once, in one instant and in one moment, here in the world of Enduring
There he went to the place where the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni was residing, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet in homage, and said
“Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Numerous Manifestations inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease
He also sends you this great lotus flower
Please accept it out of your love for us all.
The Blessed One received the lotus flower and then asked
“Noble son, is that blessed one free from discomfort? Is he strong, happy, and does he remain unchanged?
answered the bodhisattva

Situated beyond that universe, beyond as many universes as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, was a universe known as World Endowed with All Qualities
There resided the thus-gone Leader Who Displays the Body of the Buddhas to All Māras
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
This blessed one had prophesied that a bodhisattva great being known as Bearer of the Armor of Courage That Comes from Roots of Virtue Definitively Directed toward All-Seeing Buddhahood would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
That bodhisattva great being had also noticed the great light and heard the sound of the clear voice
He therefore went before that blessed one, bowed his head to his feet, and asked
“Blessed One, whose is this radiance and clear voice?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “in the west, beyond a thousand innumerable universes, lies a universe known as Enduring
Within it resides the thus-gone Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering Dharma teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection
What you witness is his power.
The bodhisattva Bearer of the Armor of Courage That Comes from Roots of Virtue Definitively Directed toward All-Seeing Buddhahood then addressed that blessed one
“Blessed One, I wish to go to that world of Enduring, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni and listen to his teachings.
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time has come, then leave.
Then the bodhisattva Bearer of the Armor of Courage That Comes from Roots of Virtue Definitively Directed toward All-Seeing Buddhahood took up eight lotus flowers and cast them toward the world of Enduring and the place where the Blessed One was residing
The lotuses passed through all the universes and landed precisely at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha, right where the Blessed One was residing
As the gatherings of the fourfold retinue of the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni beheld the lotuses they were filled with wonder
The lotuses circled around the Blessed One three times and then landed before him
As soon as the Blessed One touched the lotuses with his right hand the bodies of bodhisattvas emerged from them
Those bodhisattvas then recited the following verses of praise, after which they disappeared
“Master of infinite knowledge, foremost leader, Limitless and self-existing, you comprehend all phenomena
How vast are your infinite miracles
All the realms of the world you illumine
“Having heard the name of the Buddha
All these wise beings have made requests and expressed their wishes, And so they have arrived here through their supernatural powers That they might see and venerate the Buddha
“The heroes present who wear the robes of awakening, Remaining here in the world of Enduring, Are held back by just a single birth And endowed with superior names, bodies, and fame
“The armor they bear makes them fearless And so they apply themselves to mature others
Of the supreme guide for the world They ask how he reached supreme awakening
“To the question of why you first pursued the Dharma
You reply that it was to conquer the māras and attain awakening. Thus, when requested by these emanated beings Śākyamuni replies
“Our guide explains in words of truth
As they hear the words of the one supreme among humans
They become delighted and content, and rejoice; Prostrate to the Blissful One; and happily take their seats
“As the emanations disappear from where they were, They proceed to ask questions of the Thus-Gone One
When they are asked about where they are from and what their names are The hairs on the bodies of the retinue stand on end
“When the fourfold retinue feels disinclined To ask questions of the Victorious One out of respect
The Protector of the World will send forth emanations, An
thus the monk Ānandabhadra appeared
“Having asked his questions to the Protector He vanished and disappeared
Who are these beings and to whom do they belong
Please explain, O Protector, and dispel our doubts.
“Behold the armor of beings endowed with aspiration and courage
These beings have arrived here by the blessing of that armor
They have arrived from the east, Traveling across innumerable universes
“The heroes who have come here for the good of the world Have arrived with great consideration
Their intentions are pure and they act for the sake of awakening. Such is the character of their aspirations
“Their virtue ensures their vision of buddhahood, An
they will not feel dejection here
Nor will their discipline weaken
For they are learned and master superior transcendences
“Their skill in means is extremely vast
Without entering the womb They remain in saṃsāra, from one life to the next, Without ever forgetting the continuum of the mind of Dharma
“Constantly they encounter the buddhas
Constantly they keep company with the noble
Thus, when the beings here behold such heroes, It constantly leads to the attainment of deliverance
“The virtue that ensues from seeing such beings will immediately Surpass untold amounts of other forms of virtue
The qualities of these heroic beings Are famed in numerous ways, yet ultimately immutable
“When the name of such a perfect hero Is heard by a woma
She will never again become female, But always be a holy being of the highest kind
“When men or women hear their name, They become happy and form the aspiration To be born in that buddhafield
When their body dies, they will indeed take birth there
“Thus being born into a perfect realm
Whenever a man, woman, or anyone else Hears their name and feels faith They will never regress from the pursuit of awakening
“Apart from the beings that go naked, Anyone who hears that name yet feels no joy, And does not receive any word from a buddha either, Will nevertheless become endowed with merit
“Just as when an elixir dispels all flaws, Whoever intentionally listens to that name Will thereby also come to see them And without doubt achieve certainty regarding the nature of awakening
“If someone takes the leaves of the palāśa tree And produces elixirs from them
Then the power of such medicine Will ensure that one remains unharmed by fire
“If a fierce and potent snake venom Is used to neutralize poison, And this method taught across the earth
Then why would anyone dig for such medicine
“If brought to smell snake venom All snakes will die
Similarly, people who resemble such a medicinal elixir Will perform buddha deeds by means of their names
“Whoever hears the names of such heroes, As they resound in all directions, Will thereby be affected
Thus, no woman will touch such beings
“And so they will obviously be held in esteem and respected
The monk who is an emanation of the victorious ones And is known by the name Ānandabhadra, A name given to him by the victorious ones, “Is someone to whom anyone in pursuit of awakening should turn
Ānandabhadra, the one with a name of excellent armor — As I now hear that he is in this world I shall pronounce his name undauntedly
“Beings of lesser virtue, who find it hard to trust The profound teaching of the blissful ones And the victorious ones’ awakening, have arrived
Now my life will last only for a short while
“Ānanda, there are supreme beings Who have arrived in this retinue only today
The fame of the armor of those world protectors who have arrived here Is unstoppable throughout the ten directions
“Ānanda, Bhadrapāla, Ratnākara, Ratnākara , Susārthavāha, Guṇagupta, Pravīṇa, As well as Hero and Balabhadra—behold them all
“ Water , Varuṇa, and Bhadrapāla, Along with the monks, Who all are protectors—behold them all
Their armor is inconceivable
“Those famed under the name Amogha Are all bearers of the meaningful armor, An
they are all meaningful to behold
So what need to mention serving them
“Ānanda, whoever sees them Or hears their names Can never be turned back from awakening, And will never fall into the lower realms
“All of them will gather with diligence
All of them will gather with insight
All of them will observe the body of discipline, An
all of them will thus venerate the supreme vehicle
“Ānanda, all heroes in this buddhafield And throughout the worlds of the ten directions Who aspire to that armor Will be praised by all the victorious ones
“The victorious ones who bring forth such praises Will then be known to the bodhisattvas
Thus they behold the leader of the Śākyas, the protector of the world, As well as the heroes in pursuit of awakening
“Having heard this they supplicate, And the Protector is present in the world of Enduring
Having circumambulated the bodies of the victorious ones
All these bodhisattvas have arrived here
“The monk who hears their names Will develop the wish for supreme awakening, An
the one who pursues awakening through names and wishes Will receive the prophecy of awakening from the victorious ones
“People who have acted in unvirtuous ways Throughout innumerable eons Will, for this reason, in the dark age Journey to buddha realms together with me
“Even though I attain this supreme awakenin
I will have no joy in seeing sentient beings at that time
The monks who will appear in the future Will be savage, wild, and brutal
“Those who then, having heard of the terrors, Again and again bring forth the power of diligence And offer raw food at times of starvation Possess a savage generosity
“Those who here show great respect, Thinking, ‘In the future times of great fear I must do what is meaningful even at the cost of my life,’ Will propagate and uphold my supreme Dharma
“At that time the aspirations associated with unvirtuous acts Will remain and be present in the world
Those who now engage in such acts Will also at that time be flawed
“When they then hear a Dharma such as thi
They will believe that it is not the Dharma, Declaring, ‘The Victorious One did not teach this.
Behold the errors of the world, Ānanda
“The monks who train will then become saddened By the thought that ‘conditioned things never last.
As if their heads had caught fire They will focus all their efforts on attaining the deathless
“Hearing of the destruction of the teachings Even the gods will experience suffering
Appalled by the sights of destruction They will feel that even dying would be easier
“Today we perceive such a great sage, Who dauntlessly makes proclamations
We behold the countenance of the supreme guide, And, as we beseech him to teach, we rejoice
“Likewise do we witness monks who practice concentration
Who have gained mastery and possess skill through supernatural powers, Who have accomplished transcendent absorption and insight
How might we in the future be able to see any of that
“Evil monks will be the ones in power, An
those of discipline will be destroyed, Quickly coming to live within a household
At that time the gods will be extremely displeased
“Alas, alas, the teachings will be destroyed
Those who then commit themselves and undertake hardships Will be subdued by evil monks
Behold this destruction of the teachings
“While people enjoy each other They will defame the gentle ones
They will raise disagreements with the Buddha And take up the life of a householder
“Mixing with female lay practitioners They will act in the same way as them
Those who become disrespectful of the Buddha’s teaching Will also abandon supreme awakening
“They bring the worst harm upon the Three Jewels, Thus they will be shunned by the honorable
Such unworthy beings who defame the Leader Will likewise be shunned by those who have discipline
“At that time those of discipline will be blamed And monks will be brought down by evil
At that time of great fear and perversion You must develop sadness and be careful
“Arouse diligence in the teaching of the Blissful One
At that time there will be great terrors
Do not associate with evil monks
That time will be one of suffering.
As fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, the bodhisattva Bearer of the Armor of Courage That Comes from Roots of Virtue Definitively Directed toward All-Seeing Buddhahood now disappeared from that universe in an instant and emerged here in the world of Enduring
He proceeded to the place where the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni was residing, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet in homage, and said
“Blessed One, the blessed Leader Who Displays the Body of the Buddhas to All Māras inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease.
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “is that blessed one free from harm, is he strong, and does he remain unchanged?
answered the bodhisattva
“Yes, indeed,

These and innumerably many other bodhisattvas who were also held back by just a single birth arrived in this way at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. Proceeding to the place where the Blessed One was residing, they bowed their heads to his feet

“Blessed One, whose is this clear voice that we hear?
replied the Blessed One
“Nakṣatravali,” “to the north of here, beyond innumerable and unfathomable universes, lies a universe known as Enduring
Within it resides the thus-gone Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering Dharma teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection
In his retinue are bodhisattva great beings who bear an inconceivable armor. They have arrived there to receive the teachings
Nakṣatravali, in other worlds you will not find sentient beings who bear such an armor.
said the bodhisattva great being Nakṣatravali
“Blessed One,” “I wish to go to that universe so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni, and so that I may behold the bodhisattvas who bear that inconceivable armor.
replied the blessed Single Jewel Treasury
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time has come, then leave
On my behalf, ask that blessed one whether he has encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease
But, noble son, act with mindfulness in that buddha realm
Why do I say so
Because, noble son, the bodhisattva great beings of that realm are hard to approach.
The bodhisattva Nakṣatravali then prostrated to the feet of that blessed one, circumambulated him, and left
As fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, the bodhisattva Nakṣatravali now disappeared from that universe and emerged here in the world of Enduring
Arriving at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha, he bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, the thus-gone Single Jewel Treasury inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease.
answered the Blessed One to the bodhisattva Nakṣatravali
“Noble son,” “is that blessed one free from harm, is he strong, and does he remain unchanged and at ease?
replied the bodhisattva
“Yes indeed,
Innumerably and unfathomably many other bodhisattva great beings, who like Nakṣatravali were held back by a just a single birth, similarly arrived from the south at the place where the Blessed One was residing

As this bodhisattva arrived in the world of Enduring, he proceeded to the place where the blessed thus-gone Śākymuni was residing
Having bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet
he inquired whether the Blessed One had encountered but little harm and distress and then sat to one side
asked the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “what purpose did you perceive in coming to this world of Enduring?
replied the bodhisattva
“Blessed One,” “I have come to this place by the blessing of the thus-gone ones
But, Blessed One, although I am present in this universe
I still perceive all other realms of the world. I see all the thus-gone ones and I see all the bodhisattvas
Bodhisattvas do not think, ‘We should go to a different universe. We should meet another thus-gone one.
And why
Because they remain in one world, yet perceive all thus-gone ones
Thus, Blessed One, it is simply due to the thus-gone ones’ cultivation of the mind of awakening, and because of their powers, that we have arrived in this universe
All the other bodhisattvas who are present here have likewise arrived due to the past aspirations of the thus-gone ones, and because of their powers.
Now arrived innumerably and unfathomably many other bodhisattvas, all held back by just a single birth, from the western buddha realms of thus-gone ones such as Nectar Flower, Nectar Light, Unfathomable Array, Unfathomable Light Rays, Amitābha, Unfathomable Leader, Unfathomable Subduer, Single Heavenly Body, Nakṣatravali , Ratnacchatra, Tārarāja, Luminous Disk, King of Light , Splendor of Superior Light Rays, Infinite Light Rays, Vṛṣabha, Subjugating Infinite Leader, Unhindered Melody, Light Rays of Great Clouds, Jālinīprabha , Light Rays of the Buddha Flower, Flower of the Lotus Leader, King of Mountains , Lord of Moon Qualities, Great Radiance , Susaṃ­vṛttas­kandha, Amoghadarśin , King of the High Summit, and King of the High Lotus Summit. Arriving in the world of Enduring
they proceeded to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha and the place where the Blessed One was residing
There they bowed their heads to the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side
At that time there was in the north, beyond innumerable and unfathomable universes, a universe known as Nakṣatravali 
There resided the thus-gone Propagator of the Meaningful Name
Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma
This blessed one had prophesied that a bodhisattva known as Definite Armor of Turning the Irreversible Dharma Wheel Immediately upon Rousing the Mind would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
That bodhisattva had also noticed the great light and heard the sound of the clear voice
He therefore went before the blessed Propagator of the Meaningful Name and asked
“Blessed One, to which thus-gone one does this omnipresent light and clear voice belong?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “to the south of this buddha realm, beyond innumerable and unfathomable universes, lies a universe known as Enduring
There resides the thus-gone Śākyamuni
Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering a Dharma teaching known as the Bodhisattva Collection

said the bodhisattva Definite Armor of Turning the Irreversible Dharma Wheel Immediately upon Rousing the Mind to the thus-gone Propagator of the Meaningful Name
“Blessed One,” “I wish to travel to that world of Enduring, the buddha realm of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni.
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “if you know that the time has come, then leave
Ask that blessed one on my behalf whether he has encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease.
The bodhisattva then bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one and circumambulated him
Then, as fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, he disappeared from that universe and arrived at once, in one instant and in one moment, in the world of Enduring
There he proceeded to the place where the blessed Śākyamuni was residing, bowed his head to his feet in homage, then sat to one side and said
“Blessed One, the blessed Propagator of the Meaningful Name inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease.
asked the Blessed One in return

replied the Blessed One

Emerging from that absorption, he next entered the one known as producing roots of virtue by means of great love throughout all buddha realms 
Emerging from that absorption, he next entered the one known as the immovable 
Then, while the Blessed One was dwelling in the immovable absorption, the gods of the pure realms praised him in these verses
“Having discovered the immutable, you are beyond movement and fluctuation
Forbidding, majestic mountain —how beautiful you are
Having subdued all hostile attacks You accept the billionfold universe
“The mind of a buddha never takes any support
Supreme is the person who practices concentration without support
‘Being concentrated’ is just a name, for there is no remaining in anything
Such are the inconceivable qualities of the buddhas
“The sages escape the three realms and possess the three classes
Constantly in equipoise, they have no qualms
Please sever all doubts and dispel all qualms
Please teach the Dharma for the good of all beings
“The sage is resting, free from all qualms
The bodhisattvas gathered here Are heroes, masters of the Dharma who abide within it
We request that you cut through qualms and dispel all doubts
“Buddhas do not practice concentration with the support of the eye
Buddhas practice without the eye’s support
Support, no support, and eye—none of these apply
Such is the concentration that is praised by noble beings
“If the sages practiced concentration with the support of the ey
The victorious ones would not be pleased
When here concentration is practiced without the ey
There is no buddha and no supported meditation
“Buddhas do not practice with the support of the six faculties
Victorious ones do not have faculties and are not supported
About this point the extremists and many others remain in delusion
The world of the wanderers, including the gods, all fail to realize this.
Now the Blessed One emerged from the immovable absorption and looked upon the gathering of bodhisattvas. The
he said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, for those who have entered the Great Vehicle, four qualities serve to protect from degeneration. These four qualities likewise serve to gather the merit of all roots of virtue; accomplish the wisdom of the buddhas beyond focal points
accomplish the power of generosity; accomplish the power of discipline; accomplish the power of patience; accomplish the power of love; accomplish the power of compassion; accomplish the power of absorption; accomplish the power of insight
accomplish the ten powers of the thus-gone ones without impediment; accomplish the discernment of insight; accomplish unhindered eloquence; accomplish the eloquence that is uninterrupted, joyous, sharp, and profound
attain retention; attain vision of the buddhas; attain renunciation without ever separating from the appropriate virtuous accumulations
ensure that one’s enjoyments are not deficient
ensure that one’s circle of helpers is not incomplete
ensure that one’s body is not deficient
ensure that the major and minor parts of one’s body are not incomplete
ensure that one’s eyes, nose, ears, tongue, and body are not deficient
ensure that one’s mind is not deficient
ensure that one does not take a bad path
ensure that one’s mind is not disturbed
ensure that one’s mindfulness is not obscured
ensure that one remains mindful
ensure that one possesses supreme mindfulness
ensure that one is conscientious and decent
ensure that one refrains from negative acts; ensure regret of wrongdoing
ensure that one’s mindfulness is unbroken
ensure that birth is reversed
and ensure that one will remain mindful. “Thus
because one is very mindful, one’s past aspirations will not dissipate
Because one produces roots of virtue in relation to the blessed buddhas, one will engender unfathomable accumulations of roots of virtue in a way that does not grasp and is free from a sense of ‘mine.
Such stores will be shared with all beings, and yet one will be skilled in disengaging from observing any beings
One will achieve realization with respect to all phenomena, yet one will not take the support of any phenomenon
Since one takes no such support, one remains indomitable by māras, gods of the māra class, or any other being who has entered an unfortunate path
Instead one will become the guardian of the seat of awakening
“Residing upon one’s seat one will enter the absorption of the stainless seal of mastery with regard to all phenomena
Thus, in a single instant of insight one will understand, view, attain, and actualize everything, down to the smallest object of knowledge
All will be actualized, an
one will understand everything
There will be nothing but realization of everything, nothing but comprehension of everything, an
all the linking of habitual tendencies will be attained without exception
“What, then, are those four qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, one starts by donning the great armor of entering the Great Vehicle
Thus, one thinks, ‘All these sentient beings are full of desire, anger, and bewilderment; they are dying without a protector; they are quickly approaching death; they are falling from a great precipice; they are gripped by death and can hardly be brought to life.
Thinking in this way, one dons the armor of seeing sentient beings by means of the great view
“Thus, one pledges to accomplish the Great Vehicle that frees from the three realms so that one can teach it to sentient beings
Understanding that sentient beings must be healed, one pledges to care for them, even when not being entreated or asked to do so
‘I shall nurture all beings by helping them attain the immutable nature of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness, as well as the immutable nature of the path that transcends suffering.’ Thinking in this way, one dons the armor and persists in the pursuit of Dharma
“Which Dharma does one then pursue
The maturation of the factors of awakening and the qualities of buddhahood
That is to say, one pursues the Dharma in order to apprehend those Dharma teachings that eliminate the doubts of all beings and satisfy them, and in order to accomplish the fully developed faculties
“As one diligently pursues the Dharma
one should, at a minimum, carry upon one’s body a profound verse that includes the name of a buddha. Even if one carries just such a single four-lined skillful and profound verse
one must also teach it to others, even if it is just to one single person
And when one teaches it, one should pray, ‘May all beings comprehend the meaning of this teaching and the meaning of this verse.
“By the power of the associated roots of virtue, four things ensue that are supreme, paramount, and consummate. They are granted by the buddhas and by noble beings, praised by the learned, and beyond reproach from the wise
What are those four things
Undivided mindfulness
certain recollection of the qualities of the buddhas
becoming a proper vessel of the Dharma
and becoming a support for the blessed buddhas
Based on those, the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas will teach the Dharma
From the attainment of the second of these qualities
the attainment of retention will follow
As one reverses the process of taking birth, one will reach the full attainment of the buddhas’ awakening
One will be born into a family of people who do not have an evil view
one will go forth in and follow the teachings of the blessed buddhas, an
one will relinquish the five sense pleasures
“From the attainment of these four qualities
the associated roots of virtue will also bring forth a set of ten qualities
What are those ten
They are the accomplishment of eliminating the doubts of all sentient beings
the attainment of the support for all sentient beings
the attainment of the buddhas’ liberation free of obscuration
achieving the stage of a thus-gone one through the gateways of liberation ; shining forth billions of light rays, beyond number and count, from each single hair follicle on one’s body
illuminating hundreds of thousands of buddha realms with every single light ray
emanating hundreds of thousands of lotuses with each single light ray
emanating the body of a thus-gone one from each of those lotuses
letting each of those thus-gone ones ripen trillions of beings through teaching the Dharma
thus ripening them in accord with the attainment of the immutable intrinsic nature of form
and employing such freedom from obscuration to the effect that mountains of fire can blaze forth from each body hair, and rivers equal to the amount of sand grains in the river Ganges can gush forth from the very same body hairs
all the while employing such perfect freedom without obscuration to the effect that the thus-gone ones may penetrate an entire trichiliocosm with the tip of a hair and hurl that entire universe away, beyond more universes than there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, without any of the sentient beings living there getting the sense that their world has been transferred
“Śāradvatī­putra, endowed with such unobscured and perfect freedom, the thus-gone ones are aware of everything that is said throughout all directions
They are aware of all that has transpired within the minds of all beings throughout a trillion years
They dispel each of the doubts regarding the Dharma that may have arisen within sentient beings throughout a trillion years
Where no thus-gone one has appeared and no Dharma remains their perfect freedom enables them to know when the minds of sentient beings are destroyed, upheld, connected, or in movement
“Śāradvatī­putra, thus-gone ones who have gained this perfect freedom without any obscuration are aware of the factors that individually obscure all phenomena
The fact that they alone have penetrated the ultimate, that they know the emptiness of all entities to be itself without entity, or that they care for all gives rise to no self-oriented perception
They recognize as close to them those who think only of the Dharma, but with that exception they have no self-oriented perception of any close ones at all
Recognizing as not close to them those who engage in what is not the Dharma
they see not even a single good quality within the entirety of conditioned things
They know all conditioned things to be devoid of good qualities and full of flaws
Such are the qualities that they attain
“They also obtain another set of four qualities
What are those four
The thus-gone ones are able to interrupt the continuity of habitual tendencies
When they walk along a path, all the living creatures that are touched by the thus-gone ones’ feet will be guided toward happy states
A thus-gone one need glance no more than a wheel’s width ahead for the whole earth within sixty-two leagues to the southwest to start moving
Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones never have their minds not in equipoise
Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones are always in equipoise
Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones know no diminishing of their absorption; they know no departure from their absorption
“In short, Śāradvatī­putra, all the qualities of the thus-gone ones depend on the pursuit of the Dharma.
Then the Blessed One spoke these verses
“Through having compassion for all beings As well as respect for the Dharma, One will reach the other shore of wisdom In the vehicle intended for that goal
“Those who wish to understand the minds of beings And realize supernatural powers That are unwavering throughout the three worlds Should have respect for the Dharma
“If they have respect for the Dharma
They will always be worthy of reverence
They will connect with the most supreme Dharma Among the infinite qualities of the buddhas
“If they have respect for the Dharma, Their mindfulness will not diminish
But develop exponentially Over each and every lifetime
“If they have respect for the Dharma
They will not decline in beauty, Bu
all the main and minor parts of their body Will be exquisite, always pleasing
“They will always delight the guides And be inspired when beholding them
With a devout frame of mind, They will revere the guides of the world
“And their faith will grow exponentially, Over each and every lifetime
They will not indulge in negative desires, But abandon them and promptly go forth
“They will also be skilled in perpetually observing The collection of ethical precepts, But without conceit in their ethical discipline
They will pursue meditative absorption
“And always remain in equanimity, But without conceit in their meditative absorption
They will rely even more on insight, Which is supreme throughout all worlds
“They will become ever endowed with wisdom, But without conceit in it
Without being conceited about that wisdom, They will pursue the Dharma of the buddhas
“They will obtain the light of the Dharma, The power of retention so praised by the buddhas
The teacher, understanding them as vessels for the Dharma, Will authorize them
“Thus authorized to preach the Dharma, They will teach the Dharma to benefit living beings
With unobstructed expression and eloquence, They will attain discernment and become powerful
“They will become experts in the Dharma, At its beginning, middle, and end
They will perpetually be praised by the buddhas, And act for the great benefit of humanity
“They will likewise be praised by the gods, And revered by yakṣas and nāgas
With the buddhas’ constant praise, Their reputation will spread throughout the ten directions
“Without shirking their practice of the Dharma, Their renown will not diminish
Without ever hankering for non-Dharma, They will rely upon the Dharma of the buddhas
“Resolving the doubts of beings, They will spread the light of the Dharma
Engaging in the ways of spiritual practice, They will purify the dispositions of beings
“They will not teach the wrong path, But the correct one
With conviction in the Dharma of the buddhas They will practice it by means of the supreme of dharmas
“That is, mind is devoid of basis, And lacks any foundation
By means of the mind devoid of basis, They will practice the conduct of bodhisattvas
“Even as they course through villages of the land, Their mind does not abide
It will always lack any basis, And not have any foundation
“It is not craved by formations
Even the authentic teacher does not exist
Who would not revere Those irreproachable bodhisattvas when they are beheld
“Luminous like space, Where does such a mind exist
It does not appear in the world, For it has no foundation whatsoever
“Therefore, listen to that Dharma
I will deliver a discourse on it
Since it accomplishes the benefit of beings, I will teach on the Dharma of the buddhas
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, a bodhisattva engages in learning for the pursuit of Dharma and pursues expertise in learning
Śāradvatī­putra, what is learning ? What is expertise in learning 
Śāradvatī­putra, learning is to be imparted a message from another
Expertise in learning is to consider it properly for oneself and understand it well
Śāradvatī­putra, what is meant here by a message from another 
It is the Dharma in all its facets
the sections of sūtras, expressions in mingled prose and verse, prophetic declarations, verses, special aphorisms, narratives, parables, tales of past lives, extensive teachings, miraculous accounts, established instructions, and legends
Śāradvatī­putra, that is what is called a message from another
“Śāradvatī­putra, what is it to be expert in learning 
It is to consider it properly for oneself
And what is it to consider something properly for oneself 
It is to be expert in the aggregates, the elements, the sense sources, dependent arising, and positive and negative qualities
it is to comprehend visible and invisible phenomena, defiled and undefiled phenomena, objectionable and unobjectionable phenomena, and what is and is not to be relied upon
It is to properly understand, to be expert in, to properly comprehend, and to discern these
It is to understand well the proper Dharma, the unmistaken Dharma, and its nature
Śāradvatī­putra, that is what is called considering properly for oneself
“Śāradvatī­putra, what is the expertise in the aggregates that was taught by the Thus-Gone One
Śāradvatī­putra, he taught nothing on this whatsoever
Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise in the elements that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not taught by him at all
Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise in the sense sources that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not taught by him at all
Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise in dependent arising that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not taught by him at all. 
And, Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise in dependently originated phenomena that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not taught by him at all
“Śāradvatī­putra, when told that you should unerringly recount the meaning, how, then, should you do so
It is through reciting the meaning, not the words
Śāradvatī­putra, only the childish follow the words
The wise follow the meaning
What, then, Śāradvatī­putra, are words 
Words are terms that serve as the bases of language, communication, and expression
Words, Śāradvatī­putra, are anything that can be gleaned, understood, or mastered, such that they can be expressed, glossed, assigned, put forth, followed, analyzed, investigated, dissected, and pursued. They are the Dharma to be pursued, any Dharma, and all the Dharma and signs included in them, which can be considered, pondered on, and mentally expressed, as well as any Dharma, for that matter, that can be an object of doubt, hesitation, regret, engagement, or certainty
Now, Śāradvatī­putra, what is meaning 
It is the comprehended significance of the words
Śāradvatī­putra, ‘meaning’ is inexpressible
What is it, Śāradvatī­putra, that the immature grasp in terms of meaning? Well, it is the words, not the meaning
It is in this way, Śāradvatī­putra, that meaning is inexpressible
Śāradvatī­putra, I do not speak in conformity with the world
Thus I taught the statement, ‘The world speaks in conformity with me,’ with an indirect intention in mind
Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not taught by him at all
Therefore, the Thus-Gone One is, in this way, an expert in the aggregates, the elements, and the sense sources
Since there is no expertise in them at all, the Thus-Gone One has taught expertise in such things
“Such expertise goes as follows: The Thus-Gone One teaches the examination of phenomena
But what, Śāradvatī­putra, is phenomena and what is its examination
Śāradvatī­putra, the eyes are said to be phenomena, as are the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind
So how, Śāradvatī­putra, are the eyes phenomena
Śāradvatī­putra, eyes are so known in the past, future, and present, bu
since they are emptiness, they are not perceived
Why is that
Because that is their nature
And just like the eyes, so is the nature of the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind also emptiness
What, then, is an examination into the eyes
It is a searching inquiry into the eyes
And how does one inquire into the eyes
Well, the eyes are not perceived in the eyes
Why is that
Because if the eyes had eyes, then there would be two sets of eyes and there would be a person present within
In that way, that which is the designation of ‘eyes’ consists of a designation, a phenomenon, and eyes
“Bodhisattvas who maintain a proper vision of this matter will investigate it as follows
‘Among the eyes, the designation of eyes, and phenomena, is there any true foundation?
When investigating it in that way, they will think, ‘These all belong to the domain of language and possess no basis for a true foundation
Why is that
What is comprehended and communicated through language is mundane
What is mundane is not transcendent
What is not transcendent is a position held by the nirgranthas
It is an expression of the nirgranthas
The expressions of the nirgranthas are not the speech of the Buddha
for the Thus-Gone One has taught the transcendent
What is not transcendent was not taught by him
Although the Thus-Gone One is accomplished in speech, he teaches the Dharma in order to end speech, not to accumulate expressions.
“Furthermore, bodhisattvas will investigate it as follows
‘Through what virtue are the eyes formed
It is through definitive virtue
Why is that
It is because the eyes are limbs of existence
And why are they limbs of existence
They are called limbs of existence due to their cause
How, Śāradvatī­putra, are they termed existence 
They come into existence because of beings
That is how they appear as eyes
The effect of delighting in the eyes is that beings manifest as a result of thinking that the eyes are the self and belong to the self
Therefore, they are called existence 
One begins to grasp based on them
What is grasping
It is taking on suffering
And what is suffering
It is grasping to “I” and “mine.
Both are limbs in this context, an
that is why the eyes are called limbs of existence .
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this analogy: when sound comes from a drum, what do you think, Śāradvatī­putra, does it come from the outside or the inside?
“Blessed One, that sound is a combination of the two.
“Well, Śāradvatī­putra, do you understand their confluence?
“I do, Blessed One
It is an assemblage.
the Blessed One then said
“Well, Śāradvatī­putra, existence is just that,
“So, Śāradvatī­putra, the eyes are empty of eyes
The eyes are devoid of eyes
When it comes to them, the immature are attached to untrue objects
Likewise are the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind empty
Śāradvatī­putra, through just such a process does one seek the eyes thoroughly.
The Blessed One now spoke the following verses
“The eyes are taught to be emptiness
The eyes do not exist
If the eyes do not exist
To whom does the impermanence belong
“The ears are taught to be impermanence
They are not perceived
If the ears do not exist
To whom does the impermanence belong
“The nose is taught to be impermanence
It is not perceived
If it is not perceived
Who could speak of the impermanence
“The tongue is taught to be impermanence
The tongue does not exist
If the tongue is not perceived
To whom does the impermanence belong
“The body is taught to be impermanence
It is not perceived
If the body does not exist
To whom does the impermanence belong
“The mind is taught to be impermanence
It is not perceived
If it is not perceived
To whom does the impermanence belong
“The twelve sense sources have been taught, And they have that many names
Yet, if there are no sense sources
To whom do that many names pertain
“The elements themselves are four
They are solid, but what are they like
Like a dog pelted with lumps of dirt, They are chased by names
“Those who are not chased by names, Who do not impute a self, And experience the absence of a being, Are said to have reached nirvāṇa
“Those who have reached nirvāṇa, Do not perceive any phenomena there
For although it is called ‘nirvāṇa,
Nirvāṇa is inexpressible
“It is nowhere that can be reached, For ‘going’ too does not exist
Whoever has realized accordingly, Understands nirvāṇa
“It has no application, and no undertaking
It has no explication, and no language either
It has no person, nor any life force
Thus, it is called ‘nirvāṇa.
“Whether thinking of it as existing or not existing
Even such thoughts do not exist
And even that notion is empty
For it is considered to be nirvāṇa
“Distant phenomena are not seen, An
neither are close phenomena seen
What the nature of phenomena is, Is understood when dying
“Whoever hears such a Dharma, And understands it properly, Will become free of doubt, An
their ignorance too will vanish
“Those who guard their sublime vision are free of doubt
Unafraid of any Dharma, Their hesitations will be removed, And they will become free of doubt
“The fearless bodhisattvas, Out of compassion for all beings, Resolve their doubts about Dharma By resolving their own doubts
“The seal of all phenomena Is taught with the supreme speech In order to free others from all speaking
Have no doubt about this
“ ‘Bring an end to disputation,’ so it is taught
Because through this one will travel to the lower realms
Whoever dwells in caves Will no longer be embodied
“That is taught for accomplishing the goal, For one who attains the goal has no fixed abode
Whoever wanders, traveling in that direction, Will get closer to awakening
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are firm in their resolve on four matters: going forth
dwelling in the forest; seeing the Thus-Gone One; and, when seeing suffering sentient beings, donning the armor of thinking, ‘The time will come when I shall accomplish the vehicle of the Great Vehicle and teach the Dharma in order to liberate those beings from all suffering.
“Śāradvatī­putra, listen well and keep in mind what I will now tell you about exactly how firm bodhisattva great beings are with respect to unexcelled and perfect awakening, and just how bodhisattva great beings, through their resolve, accomplish the wisdom of awakening
“Śāradvatī­putra, long ago, immeasurably vast and countless beyond countless eons ago, there appeared in the world a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone wise and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman taming beings, an unsurpassable one, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha by the name of Sukharāja
Śāradvatī­putra, Sukharāja’s lifespan was seventy thousand years
The thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Sukharāja had three assemblies of hearers: the first consisted of two hundred million arhats
the second was four hundred million arhats, an
the third was six hundred billion arhats
“Back then, that Jambudvīpa was broad and vast, extending across nine million leagues
It had eighty-four thousand cities an
all of them were brilliant and exquisite, fashioned from the seven kinds of precious substances: gold, silver, crystal, cat’s eye, coral, emerald, and red pearl
The cities were twelve leagues in length, and seven leagues in width
They were all wealthy, healthy, happy, pleasant, abundant in food, and well populated
All the cities were surrounded by seven walls and seven moats
All the moats were filled with water that was flowing all around, covered with blue, red, pink, and white lotus flowers, and resounding with the sounds of ducks and various other birds, like geese, herons, peacocks, parrots, myna birds, cuckoos, and pheasants
“All the banks of the moats were filled with trees composed of the seven precious substances
trees of gold with branches of silver, leaves of cat’s eye, shoots of emerald, flowers of crystal, fruits of coral, and stalks of red pearl
trees of silver with branches of gold, leaves of crystal, shoots of cat’s eye, fruits of coral, flowers of emerald, and stalks of red pearl
trees of crystal with trunks of cat’s eye, shoots of gold, leaves of silver, flowers of coral, fruits of emerald, and stalks of red pearl
trees of coral with trunks of emerald, shoots of red pearl, leaves of silver, flowers of gold, fruits of crystal, and roots of cat’s eye
trees of emerald with trunks of red pearl, shoots of silver, leaves of gold, flowers of crystal, fruits of cat’s eye, and roots of coral
and trees of red pearl with trunks of gold, shoots of silver, leaves of crystal, flowers of cat’s eye, fruits of coral, and roots of emerald
“Each one of those cities had eighty thousand parks, each of which was twenty leagues square
Each of those eighty thousand parks was surrounded by moats, seven tiers of arched doorways, seven layers of lattices with tiny bells, and seven rows of altars
In accordance with the previous description of the moats of the cities
it should be understood that the moats of the parks appeared in just the same way
In addition, however, those parks had sandal tree shoots, seasonal trees, musical trees, ornamental trees, flowering trees, food-bearing trees, and drink-bearing trees
Those parks, moreover, had trees composed of gold, silver, crystal, cat’s eye, coral, and red pearl
On them grew flowers, such as atimuktaka flowers, campaka flowers, vārṣikī flowers, dhānuṣkari flowers, aśoka flowers, black flowers, valla flowers, taraṇi flowers, gotaraṇi flowers, both kinds of mandārava flowers, five-colored flowers, candrotaraṇi flowers, and many other different kinds
Each of those parks also had seven thousand ponds
all of which were filled with water replete with the eight qualities, measured half a league across, were formed from the seven precious substances, were strewn with golden sand, and had four sets of steps
All those ponds were also covered with jewel nets, and filled with blue, red, pink, and white lotuses
“At that time there was a king called Vīradatta
Śāradvatī­putra, King Vīradatta had eighty-four thousand houses in his eighty-four thousand cities, with a harem of eighty-four thousand women in each house
In that Jambudvīpa, at the center of those eighty-four thousand cities was a large city that was eighty thousand leagues in length and forty thousand leagues in width, composed of the seven precious substances, wealthy, healthy, happy, abundant in food, pleasant, and well populated, just as previously described
In the center of that large city was built one of Vīradatta’s houses, made from the seven precious substances and ten leagues square
That house had an enclosure made of gold and multiple stories
At the center of that house was built a palace like Vaijayanta, the palace of Indra
It was called Dharma 
The king had a garden called Dharmabhadra
In the center of the house there was also a park, which was decorated throughout with different kinds of incense-bearing trees, musical trees, ornamental trees, and fabric-bearing trees, all composed of the seven precious substances
The park, moreover, was divided into multiple square sections
The house also had four sides, which were each adorned all around with brilliant and exquisite upper chambers made of the seven precious substances, and ornamented with balconies with elevated arched doorways, lookout points, and windows
“Once, King Vīradatta’s main wife gave birth to a son, a bodhisattva who had revered previous victorious ones. He was exquisite, beautiful, powerful, renowned for his great influence, and shone with glory and majesty
As soon as he was born, King Vīradatta gave him that city, saying, ‘This will be his to enjoy.
King Vīradatta then took for the boy’s pleasure all the four million maidens that existed
The king, his wife Precious , the townspeople, and the country people all gave him the name Puṇyottama
Why so
Śāradvatī­putra, just as soon as the king’s son Puṇyottama was born, the gods sang songs from on high and showered down a rain of divine sandalwood powder and divine mandārava flowers, exclaiming in divine cadence, ‘Supreme merit, this child is born! Supreme merit, this child is born!
It is for that reason, Śāradvatī­putra, he was only named ‘Puṇyottama.
“Śāradvatī­putra, when Prince Puṇyottama had come of age, he would embark on a sandalwood boat within the park grounds, attended by his harem, and partake in pleasures, dallying in the five sense pleasures of women
Once, while the prince was in the sandalwood boat
he saw the Thus-Gone One teaching the Dharma in the midst of an assembly of śrāvakas. His body—radiating billions of light rays the color of fire, gold, moonlight, and gold from the Jāmbū River—was replete with the thirty-two marks of a great being, shone like gold, and was adorned like jewel inlay
Seeing him, Prince Puṇyottama thought
‘May I too become exactly like that!
No sooner had Puṇyottama formed that thought, than the body of the Thus-Gone One vanished
leaving Puṇyottama anguished and in despair, unable even to dally with and enjoy his girls
Incapable of partaking of such pleasures, he did not make love to them
After he disembarked and entered his quarters
he sat down with his legs crossed and immersed himself in the thought, ‘May I one day become exactly like that thus-gone one.
“Now, whenever Prince Puṇyottama saw from afar that any girl was coming toward him
he shut the door and thought, ‘Alas! These beings, filled with desire, are afflicted with a severe illness
What if I were to enjoy such beings, who, filled with desire, are afflicted with such a severe illness
Since they are improper and I am proper, that would not suit me
Those beings, filled with anger, are afflicted with a severe illness
What if I were to take pleasure in those beings, who, filled with anger, are afflicted with a severe illness
Since they are improper and I am proper, what a difference there will be
I will strive to manifest a body like that of the Thus-Gone One
Ah! I will restrain my own mind
I will not have ill will toward those beings
Alas! Those beings, filled with delusion, are afflicted with a severe illness
What if I were to follow beings afflicted with such a severe illness
Since they are improper and I am proper, what a difference there will be
I will strive to manifest such a sublime body
Those beings, filled with jealousy and rage, are afflicted with a severe illness
What if I were to follow those beings
Since they are improper and I am proper, what a difference there will be
I will strive to manifest such a sublime body
Ah! I will remove jealousy
I will not be stingy, I will remove stupidity, and, freeing myself of desire, anger, and delusion, I will also have love and compassion for those very beings
I will seek a path that, when those beings embark upon it, brings an end to all their desire, anger, delusion, jealousy, rage, stinginess, treachery, deceit, aggression, and pride—a path by which they will discard, no longer indulge in, not habituate themselves to, nor increase any of these.
Śāradvatī­putra, thus was Puṇyottama unhappy, and immersed in despair
He neither dallied in, nor enjoyed, nor took pleasure in anything, and did not show himself to anyone
“Śāradvatī­putra, when King Vīradatta heard that Prince Puṇyottama was not dallying, enjoying himself, or celebrating, but would shut his door whenever he saw a girl
King Vīradatta and his wife Precious thought
‘It is not right that Prince Puṇyottama feels so unhappy and depressed with everything
We must by all means inquire into why he is not dallying, enjoying himself, or celebrating, but shuts his door whenever he sees a girl.
King Vīradatta and his main wife then went before Prince Puṇyottama and spoke to him the following verses
“ ‘Here in the Dharma palace and the Dharmabhadra garden, So filled with heavenly girls, And its parks adorned with a variety of trees
Why, Prince, do you not take pleasure in your home
“ ‘Here in the palace with its wooden spires, In this city that extends throughout the kingdom, And that illuminates this Jambudvīpa
Why, Prince, do you not take pleasure in your home
“ ‘Has anyone spoken unpleasantly to you today
From where did you incur such unpleasantness
Why do you ponder on only this, Like a merchant who has squandered his fortune
“ ‘I am your father, and this your mother. Please answer our questions
Since I am now the lord of Jambudvīpa
I will promptly impose a severe penalty on whomever’s responsible.
“Śāradvatī­putra, Prince Puṇyottama responded to his parents with these verses
“ ‘No one at all has spoken to me unpleasantly
Since there have been no such words, How can I inform you
Please do not punish anyone at all
“ ‘Punish my own mind
When I was coursing in the water here
I saw the sublime body of a guide, Radiating billions of golden light rays throughout Jambudvīpa
“ ‘He illuminated everything and was so beautiful That the light of the ground, the light of fire, The light of the moon, and the light of the sun Were all eclipsed in his presence
“ ‘I saw such a sublime body as that, Father, And thought, “By my mind assuming the form of wisdom, May I become exactly like that sublime body!
I will free beings from the afflictions of old age and illness
“ ‘I will bring joy to those with afflicted minds
In that very wisdom body, With its strength, power, and inconceivable nature, I will enact vast benefit for people
“ ‘I will free beings from dwelling in the lower realms
I have indulged in dallying and pleasures
I have indulged in household and girls
I will renounce it all and go forth
“ ‘I will be trained by the buddhas and become awakened
Donning the ochre robes, I will go forth and practice the Dharma
‘Father, you too should go forth
Renounce the kingdom and practice the Dharma
I will constantly pursue the Dharma
I will constantly practice the Dharma properly
“ ‘Happiness does not come from indulging in desire
Rather, it will diminish everything wholesome
Dear Father, the fetters of desire are tight
Hereafter, you will not be free from its bonds
“ ‘Renounce desire and dwell in the forest
Thereby you will attain the wisdom of awakening
There will never be any happiness, Father, For he who prevents me today “ ‘From going forth in the teaching of the Buddha— Rather, doing so will incur great fault
Dear Father, I say this for your benefit
What good is the kingdom, what good to you a son
“ ‘The kingdom is impermanent, as are enjoyments
You will part with them before long
If you do not practice the Dharma, From which so many positive qualities are gained
“ ‘You will continue to be immersed in the cycle of saṃsāra
To be born and age, again and again
There never existed a son there
For all those phenomena are empty, Father
“ ‘Those who do not reflect on phenomena as empty Adhere strictly to name and form
Do not commit negative deeds out of craving for a son
I am going forth in the teaching of the Buddha
“ ‘I will obtain perfect leisure for a long time
Dear Father, you too should immediately go forth
You will obtain this human body, And become a buddha, a lord of bliss
“ ‘Today I have gained a deep faith
Alas, dear Father, come with me and go forth!
“Having thus spoken
Prince Puṇyottama went to where the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Sukharāja was staying, bowed to his feet, circumambulated him three times, and sat before him
With palms joined, he then spoke the following verses
“ ‘I was born in the noose of Māra
I have fomented the experiences of Māra
I beg you, Lord, to sever the noose of Māra, And allow me to go forth
“ ‘Protector, I am tightly bound by fetters
Bound by great fear, I beg you to look after me
There is no taste of joy here
Desire is the root of all pain
“ ‘I have come here having cut through those bonds
And now, having cast off all those fetters of Māra
I wish to go forth in the Buddha’s teaching And become a buddha, the best of humans.
“Śāradvatī­putra, then the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Sukharāja allowed Prince Puṇyottama to go forth
Knowing that he had gone forth
eight trillion beings went forth in emulation of Prince Puṇyottama
Knowing that those beings had gone forth
Prince Puṇyottama’s harem also went forth
Knowing that they had gone forth
one billion of Prince Puṇyottama’s friends also went forth
“Śāradvatī­putra, then King Vīradatta, learning that his son had gone forth, went accompanied by his fourfold army before the thus-gone one Sukharāja, bowed to his feet, an
with palms joined, spoke these verses
“ ‘This Dharma is free of injury and pain
Its nature is peace—permanent, deathless peace
Going forth is the root of all joy
I will go forth in the Buddha’s teaching
“ ‘I will abandon the kingdom and its enjoyments, My beloved wives and dear relatives
There is no satiation with sensuous pleasures
Negative phenomena do not last
“ ‘My mind has gravitated toward the plethora of enjoyments, An experience for small-minded children
But if I practice the Dharma praised by the Victorious One
I will bring an end to all suffering
“ ‘I will give up the kingdom to the Victorious One, To enjoy together with the assembly of monks
I beg to go forth
practicing it fully, I will become a buddha, the best of humans
“ ‘I will perform vast benefit for the sake of people, And free beings afflicted with much suffering
Having renounced vastly unfortunate states
I will obtain fortunate states and the peace of nirvāṇa.
“Sukharāja replied with the following meaningful expression
‘Well done, great royal-minded king
Whenever you should desire the wisdom of awakening
You are welcome to come and immediately and promptly enter the order!
“Having heard that, the king was elated and thought
‘May I go forth in the Victorious One’s teaching
May I become a buddha, the best of humans
Sukharāja has accepted me.
“That victorious one allowed him to go forth in the teaching
Then, accompanied by his fourfold army
They all embarked on the supreme vehicle, thinking
‘May we become buddhas, the best of humans.
“They then went forth into the Buddha’s teaching
Having practiced the Dharma, they also developed patience
When their lives were over and they died
They were all born into the higher realms
“They were reborn at the time of a buddha who was a guide To two hundred million renowned blissful ones
They served them all, And practiced the Dharma according to all their teachings
“They applied diligence constantly and continuously, And
unafraid due to their powerful insight, They performed vast benefit for people And freed billions of beings
“Upholding the Dharma taught by the blissful ones, They became victorious ones capable of guiding beings, [And spread the teaching, Giving away their bodies, and even their lives.
[“Upholding the Dharma taught by the blissful ones, ]They [became victorious ones capable of guiding beings, And ]spread the teaching, Giving away their bodies, and even their lives
“They are unexcelled at ripening Whomever cannot be inducted into the supreme vehicle
They will attain unexcelled, supreme wisdom
Reaching the awakening of peaceful nirvāṇa
“Venerable Śāradvatī­putra, if you have any doubt or hesitation, thinking that the righteous Dharma king called King Vīradatta, who at that time offered his kingdom to the blessed thus-gone one Sukharāja for his enjoyment, and went forth from home to homelessness, was someone else
do not see it like that, Śāradvatī­putra
For I was King Vīradatta
And, Śāradvatī­putra, if you have any doubt or hesitation, thinking that Prince Puṇyottama was someone else
do not see it like that
For, Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dṛḍhamati was Prince Puṇyottama
“Śāradvatī­putra, the nature of bodhisattva great beings is to engender great compassion when seeing beings afflicted with suffering
Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas strive for the profound Dharma, [pursue only the profound Dharma, and perfectly teach only the profound Dharma.
[Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas strive for the profound Dharma, ]pursue only the profound Dharma, and [perfectly teach only the profound Dharma.
[Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas strive for the profound Dharma, pursue only the profound Dharma, and ]perfectly teach only the profound Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, what are the profound dharmas in which they become stable
And what, Śāradvatī­putra, is their stability
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are called stable becaus
they do not become discouraged or despondent about unexcelled and perfect awakening
Śāradvatī­putra, when it is said that they are stable, it is because they grasp the dharmas
What dharmas do they grasp
Dharmas can be grasped with the eyes
but, Śāradvatī­putra, what the eyes grasp is not dharmas, which are not something held
What, then, is the Dharma, Śāradvatī­putra
It is by nature neither inside, nor outside
It has neither a self, nor does it belong to a self
It has neither affliction, nor purification
Dharmas are grasped by the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, bu
in that respect, what the dharmas are is not the mind and so forth
Śāradvatī­putra, Dharma is something that has neither a self, nor does it belong to a self; it has neither inside, nor outside; it has neither affliction, nor purification; it has neither birth, nor cessation
Why, Śāradvatī­putra
Because that is its nature
its nature is not something made, and does not change, and therefore mind is called Dharma
“Why, Śāradvatī­putra, is grasping so termed
It enables the grasping of emptiness, and the grasping of signlessness and wishlessness
It enables the grasping of non-perception as wishlessness, for non-perception is wishlessness
Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, dharmas are neither to be removed, nor established
Those who are free of removing and establishing are called graspers of dharmas 
Therefore, they are called bodhisattvas 
Since bodhisattvas, Śāradvatī­putra, are beings ( sattva ) who are close to the buddhas, they are called bodhisattvas 
Since there is no awakening ( bodhi ), they are called bodhisattvas 
Alternatively, since the being ( sattva ) enters awakening due to the very non-existence of beings, they are therefore called bodhisattvas
“Śāradvatī­putra, alternatively, if bodhisattvas were to teach, they would teach in this way
That is why, Śāradvatī­putra, being without a teaching is being a bodhisattva
Who has nothing to teach
No one at all has anything to teach. Therefore, teaching is so termed
Śāradvatī­putra, joyous, they are inclined toward nonduality
for they preach neither Dharma nor non-Dharma. Thus are bodhisattvas so termed
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, awakening is awakening to emptiness
And emptiness , Śāradvatī­putra, is emptiness of what
It is emptiness of any phenomena
Śāradvatī­putra, if there is anything perceived as a phenomenon, there will be grasping to that perception, grasping as self, grasping as a being, grasping as a life force, grasping as a person, and the grasping of all grasping. Therefore, grasping to perception is so termed
The absence of that is termed emptiness ; an
emptiness is awakening
Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, all phenomena are awakening, and likewise, perfect buddhahood. Thus
act in harmony and do not act in disharmony with this
This is because awakening is profound—so profound that no immature, ordinary beings progress toward it
And moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, let alone ordinary beings, even worthy ones and solitary buddhas do not progress toward it, despite having actualized knowledge of non-arising, from beholding the knowledge of exhaustion and the knowledge of non-arising
Knowledge of exhaustion comes from bringing what to exhaustion
Knowledge of exhaustion does not come from bringing any phenomenon to exhaustion
Moreover, it is because all phenomena themselves are exhausted that knowledge of exhaustion is so termed
It is because that knowledge belongs to noble beings that knowledge of exhaustion is so termed
Knowledge of exhaustion is so termed because there is no knowledge such as, ‘All this was exhausted,’ ‘Such and such was exhausted,’ or ‘Everything from here on was exhausted.
Therefore, it is said that not even worthy ones or solitary buddhas progress toward awakening
“Śāradvatī­putra, why is non-arising so called
Śāradvatī­putra, it is because not even the subtlest particle has arising that non-arising is so called
Śāradvatī­putra, the knowledge of that is called knowledge of non-arising
“It is because hearers lack the knowledge that ‘that does not arise from this,’ or ‘this will henceforth not arise,’ that the limitless wisdom of buddhas is so called
Why is the wisdom of a buddha limitless
Since that wisdom has no parallel and no limit, the wisdom of a buddha is called limitless 
Since that wisdom is devoid of object, the wisdom of a buddha is so called
“Śāradvatī­putra, how is the wisdom of a buddha taught to be
Since that wisdom is awakened to, it is called the wisdom of a buddha 
Since that wisdom is sought after, it is called the wisdom of a buddha 
Śāradvatī­putra, how is buddha taught to be
Śāradvatī­putra, beings are fickle
Śāradvatī­putra, beings flee from this state, and fail to comprehend it
Yet, Śāradvatī­putra, the buddhas have awakened to all phenomena, and therefore they are called buddhas
And how have they awakened to all phenomena
They have awakened to the very fact that there are neither phenomena nor non-phenomena, neither affliction nor purification, and that there is no present, past, or future
They have awakened to the very fact that there is no arising, engagement, exhaustion, coming, going, affliction, purification, or cessation at all
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, since, being limitless and immeasurable, they are difficult to fathom and comprehend, they are awakened
Śāradvatī­putra, it is like the following analogy
The ocean is of a single taste, free of being filled or depleted, and deep
So, too, Śāradvatī­putra, is the ‘ocean’ of a thus-gone one
Because he teaches the profound Dharma with the taste of liberation, the taste of non-arising, and the taste of non-exhaustion as its single taste, he collects them progressively into his teaching of Dharma; because he resolves all doubts he absorbs all the waters of questions; because he does not forget any Dharma he is without depletion; and because he is the very presence of Dharma there is no filling him
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, when the nature of a buddha is explained, who can comprehend that topic
It is like the following analogy, Śāradvatī­putra
When the great nāga king Sāgara (Ocean) makes it rain
he does so only in his own place, the ocean
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, there is no place whatsoever, aside from a place consecrated by a thus-gone one, that can withstand the torrent of water from the great nāga king Sāgara
In the same way, Śāradvatī­putra, when a thus-gone one teaches on the nature of a thus-gone one and speaks about the characteristics of a buddha’s wisdom
I have never seen in the realms of beings any hearer, solitary buddha, or ordinary being who can understand it fully, that is, aside from a bodhisattva who has perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle and been authorized by a thus-gone one
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four things, difficult to understand and extremely difficult to obtain, that today you have
What are these four
Śāradvatī­putra, human birth is exceedingly difficult to obtain
Śāradvatī­putra, the emergence of a thus-gone one is exceedingly difficult to obtain
Śāradvatī­putra, faith in a thus-gone one’s teaching is exceedingly difficult to obtain. And
Śāradvatī­putra, having gained faith, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain an audience to inquire about what is tenable and what is untenable
Śāradvatī­putra, these four things, so exceedingly difficult to obtain and understand, you have obtained
“Śāradvatī­putra, ask me about any teaching with which you have doubt
Śāradvatī­putra, you should take this opportunity on behalf of the world with its gods
Śāradvatī­putra, since I will pass away before too long, an
since, Śāradvatī­putra, it would not be fitting for you to have regrets later, ask me!
Then the venerable Śāradvatī­putra rose from his seat, draped his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and said to the Blessed One
“If, in order to clarify questions, the Blessed One would allow me the opportunity
I will ask the Blessed One about some points.
The Blessed One said to Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, I will delight you with each answer I give
Ask whatever you wish of the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Buddha!
Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, I will ask the Thus-Gone One on behalf of beings who adhere to exalted conduct and qualities
“I ask the Thus-Gone One the following: There are some who adhere to exalted conduct and qualities, Who are exalted by way of observing abstinence, And who are gentle, patient, and filled with aspirations. “How do these skilled beings practice generosity
Having given, how should they rejoice
How should they mentally form the dedication
How should they give without any stinginess
“How should they observe discipline
How should they have patience
How should their effort be
How will they become gentle
“How, when seeing suffering beings, Should they direct their minds
Please tell me, O Guide, about the thoughts Of those bodhisattvas
“For those who wear armor For many billions of eons, How can their minds not be afflicted
How do they rejoice
“What is their absorption like
What is their insight like
And how are they learned
What is their learning like
“What are the teachings that they listen to
What are the dharmas they abandon
I ask about the experience of those Who have set out for awakening
“How should they pursue the sublime Dharma
What is their aspiration like
How do they abandon desire
How do they go forth
“How do those who go forth Experience abundant joy
How, having gone forth, Are they exalted and adorned by qualities
“How do they firmly direct their minds
What are their methods like
How do they recollect past lives
What is their recollection like
“How does the mind of awakening arise For those who have entered the womb
How will they see complete awakening there
How will their vision be unmistaken
“How will their desire diminish, And their anger diminish, and how will they become fearless
How will their delusion disappear, So that they become unconfused
“How will the skilled, born into the royal caste, Be conferred the kingdom to rule, And, having abandoned all unfavorable conditions, Become eternally respected
“How, when the kingdom is praised, Will it not turn their smiles into wrath
How will they attain a vision of buddhahood In that victory of theirs
“How will they become beautiful, Always prosperous, Accompanied by a retinue, And embark upon supreme awakening
“How, just upon birth, Will they be discontent with the household, Become intent on going forth, And lose all their craving
“How, having gone forth, Will they uphold the awakening of the Buddha
How, after the Thus-Gone One’s passing, Will they uphold the sublime Dharma
“How, in the tumultuous world, Will they not be disturbed or afraid, And, understanding the torment of the world, Become a widely renowned savior
“How will they retain what they have heard, To obtain the gate of retention, And with unobstructed eloquence Bestow upon beings the Dharma so retained
“How will they know the minds Of other beings
How will they eliminate non-virtuous mental states, So that they are always virtuous
“And if I may request, best among humans, On behalf of bodhisattvas, What is the conduct of bodhisattvas? Please teach on the questions I have asked
“Those who have engendered the altruistic attitude For the sake of the qualities of the buddhas Will have sublime joy Upon hearing the elucidation of these issues
“The wisdom of a buddha is unobstructed
It partakes of all phenomena
With my partial knowledge, I wish to ask the Guide of the World these questions
“I do not understand those teachings That I have not properly enquired about
May the teacher please teach What bodhisattvas’ conduct is!
The Blessed One then said to Śāradvatī­putra
“Well done, well done, Śāradvatī­putra
Śāradvatī­putra, you have done well to request the Thus-Gone, worthy, perfectly awakened Buddha on behalf of the bodhisattva great beings, and on behalf of those who have embraced the altruistic intention and practice wholesome conduct, patience, and gentleness
“Śāradvatī­putra, the limit of qualities cannot be fathomed
Śāradvatī­putra, the beings on whose behalf you ask the Thus-Gone One questions perform only limited hardships
For instance, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone were to bring to mind all the beings that exist throughout the trichiliocosm
What do you think, Śāradvatī­putra, would that person have performed a difficult task?
“Indeed, Blessed One, that person would have performed a difficult task.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the difficulty of that former task does not approach even one hundredth of the difficulties of a bodhisattva’s task
It does not approach even one thousandth, or one hundred thousandth of a fraction of that difficulty—there can be no comparison
“As another instance, Śāradvatī­putra
suppose the trichiliocosm were to become completely engulfed in flames—flaring, burning, and blazing—and someone were to extinguish that fire with one breath, and then [with another breath, protect the Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa mountain ranges, the great king of mountains Sumeru, and other giant mountains;
[suppose the trichiliocosm were to become completely engulfed in flames—flaring, burning, and blazing—and someone were to extinguish that fire with one breath, and then ]with another breath, protect the Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa mountain ranges, the great king of mountains Sumeru, and other giant mountains; the oceans, continents, and palaces, along with all the delightful gardens, parks, forests, rivers, and pools; and all the towns, cities, counties, and regions
Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think
Would that person have performed a difficult task?
“Indeed, Blessed One, that person would have performed a difficult task.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the difficulty of that former task does not approach even one hundredth of the difficulties of a bodhisattva’s task
It does not match even one thousandth or one hundred thousandth of the former—no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice
“As another instance, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone were to shatter, scatter, and destroy the trichiliocosm
What do you think, Śāradvatī­putra
Would such a person be diligent?
“Indeed, Blessed One
such a person would have supreme diligence.
“Śāradvatī­putra, that first diligence does not approach even a hundredth of the diligence of a bodhisattva—no comparison would suffice
“As another instance, Śāradvatī­putra
suppose someone were to climb, without falling, all the way up to the world of Brahmā, on a ladder made of the legs of mosquitoes, carrying on their shoulders as much water as could fill the trichiliocosm
What do you think, Śāradvatī­putra
Would that person have performed a difficult task?
“Blissful One, that person would have performed an extremely difficult task
that person would have diligence and great prowess.
“Śāradvatī­putra, you should trust and comprehend tha
this former strength, diligence, and skill in means would not approach so much as a hundredth of the strength, diligence, and skill in means of a bodhisattva
It does not match even one thousandth or one hundred thousandth of a portion, and no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, those sublime beings, endowed with such mental diligence, physical diligence, physical prowess, and skill in means, are equipped with aspirations and power
Śāradvatī­putra, committed to such knowledge, they are committed to the Great Vehicle, great fearlessness, great vision, buddha wisdom, and great compassion
Being endowed with such comportment and conduct, they are committed to the practice and ascertainment of qualities
“They are committed to the accomplishment of generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, absorption, and insight
They are committed to the accomplishment of skill in means
They are immersed in the accomplishment of awakened attributes, buddha manifestations, infinite supreme guides, awakened supernatural powers, and gifts of Dharma
They are immersed in the skilled accomplishment of the wishes of beings and the conduct of beings
They are intent upon and committed to the subjugation of beings’ minds
They are immersed in the accomplishment of connecting with beings’ minds
They are immersed in the accomplishment of the perception of beings
They are immersed in the accomplishment of beings’ discipline, absorption, and liberation
They are immersed in the accomplishment of the liberated wisdom vision of beings
They are immersed in the accomplishment of beings’ tranquility and special insight
They are immersed in the accomplishment of beings’ path, fruition, and truth
“The reason for this, Śāradvatī­putra, is that such sublime beings as these, who understand signs according to the languages and conventions prevalent throughout the ten directions, have attained the state of wisdom unhindered with regard to any phenomena, are immersed in accomplishing the wisdom that masters all phenomena, and are immersed in accomplishing the wisdom in which all phenomena are empty
“Śāradvatī­putra, in sum, these sublime beings are immersed in, adhere to, aspire for, and constantly cultivate such a wisdom
These sublime beings are committed to such qualities of armor-like diligence and conduct
Since they are following such a path
Śāradvatī­putra, the analogies I have explained illustrate how minor, meager, and trifling others are by comparison
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, for those sublime beings who have enacted that armor-like diligence, such analogies are individually suited
as these are precisely according to how the Thus-Gone One understands it
Those who possess such a wisdom, which is precisely the one possessed by a thus-gone one, should learn and comprehend each of those analogies
Śāradvatī­putra, hearers should approach that state through faith, for they will not comprehend it exactly as it is
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, you have posed questions to the Thus-Gone One on behalf of such beings. And yet
Śāradvatī­putra, I will provide you with only a mere introduction, a mere smidgen, a mere illustration, a mere trifling, and a mere approximation
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, understanding such things does not entail a day’s activity, a fortnight’s activity, a month’s activity, a year’s activity, a hundred years’ activity, a thousand years’ activity, a hundred thousand years’ activity, an eon’s activity, a hundred eons’ activity, a thousand eons’ activity, or a hundred thousand eons’ activity
Rather, Śāradvatī­putra, it is the activity of immeasurably many, countless eons
If, Śāradvatī­putra, one cannot cover in one hundred eons, one thousand eons, or one hundred thousand eons even the qualities of the meager, trifling, and miniscule heap of merit that constitutes the very heap of merit from first giving rise to the mind of awakening, the
there is no need even to discuss whether one could understand the extent of the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattva great beings—it is impossible
“Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas involves an immeasurable collection of merit, since it is for the purpose of great wisdom
Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas knows no end, since it matures innumerable beings
Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas is difficult to comprehend, since it is the very comprehension of the profound Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas is profound, since it is the very absence of foundation in all phenomena
Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas is free of limit or boundary, since it is itself the infinite buddha wisdom
Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas has no culmination, since it is immeasurable
“Śāradvatī­putra, one may think, ‘I will bring this many beings to nirvāṇa. I will practice this much generosity. I will cultivate this much discipline, this much patience, this much diligence, this much concentration, and this much insight. I will cultivate these for a certain period of time, but then at some point later on I will not cultivate them further.
And yet, Śāradvatī­putra, the conduct of bodhisattvas is entirely free of culmination
Śāradvatī­putra, this is because bodhisattvas only see the sole culmination of the heart of awakening, such that
having attained the absorption called stainless utter purity of all phenomena 
they fully realize all phenomena
“Śāradvatī­putra, the exalted intention of bodhisattva great beings should be regarded in terms of three points
The first exalted intention should be understood as the very action of renouncing all things
The second exalted intention of a bodhisattva should be understood as the very non-existence of any special clinging to self, even while pursuing the Dharma, receiving the Dharma, and fully upholding the Dharma
The third exalted intention, Śāradvatī­putra, is not discarding the profound Dharma and being keenly interested, without discouragement, in partaking in the awakening of all blessed buddhas
Śāradvatī­putra, the exalted intention of a bodhisattva should be regarded in terms of those three points
“Śāradvatī­putra, the exalted intention of bodhisattva great beings should also be regarded in terms of three other points
What are these three points
The constant application of diligence in pursuit of the Dharma out of a desire for the Dharma discourses of the Bodhisattva Collection
following Dharma teachers in order to refine their own and all beings’ roots of virtue; an
the third exalted intention of bodhisattvas, which is the repeated demonstration of service by presenting unexcelled service to such teachers. In this regard, when seeing that such service can be difficult, one should think, ‘This is a demonstration of my karma. Therefore, my not having heard is my own karma and there is no one to blame. Thus, I must by all means purify and sever all my karmic obscurations through service.
Śāradvatī­putra, you should therefore regard this explanation to mean that the perfection of all buddha qualities is brought about through striving by all means to pursue the Dharma, and following Dharma teachers
“Śāradvatī­putra, long ago, immeasurably vast and countless beyond countless eons ago, in the eon called Jñānottama , there appeared in the world a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone wise and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman taming beings, an unsurpassable one, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha by the name of Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa
Śāradvatī­putra, the lifespan of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa lasted a full half eon
Śāradvatī­putra, the assembly of hearers of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa numbered as many as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
Each of the hearers assembled, moreover, had actualized within their physical existence emancipation from both parts, excellent insight, and excellent view
Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone one Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa also had an assembly of just as many bodhisattva great beings as he had hearers
Since the irreversible bodhisattvas were as many in number as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, there is no need to mention the number of bodhisattva great beings who had newly embarked on that vehicle
Śāradvatī­putra, by the time the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa passed away
he had authorized one billion Dharma preachers throughout one billion Jambudvīpas
“Śāradvatī­putra, the sublime Dharma of the thus-gone one Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa remained for eight quintillion years
Śāradvatī­putra, during that time, the lifespan of beings was eight hundred million years and
since no one died prematurely
everyone could fully complete all their actions
Śāradvatī­putra, a Dharma preacher called Prabhakīrti then appeared in that Jambudvīpa
Śāradvatī­putra, the Blessed One blessed the bodhisattva Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti to remain for as long as his sublime Dharma remained
Śāradvatī­putra, Prabhakīrti attained acceptance and became irreversible
Later, Śāradvatī­putra, as the sublime Dharma was disappearing, the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti perfectly taught the perfect accomplishment of a thus-gone one’s awakening for countless millions of eons, going from village to village, town to town, country to country, and realm to realm
“Śāradvatī­putra, during that time there was in that Jambudvīpa a frontier town called Dhṛtivati
There was a householder in that town called Dhṛtisena
The householder Dhṛtisena, being in the prime of youth, performed obligations on behalf of the town
At some point, a thought occurred to him about his immersion in the town’s business
‘What kind of knowledge should I gain in order to teach others the sublime Dharma such that, upon teaching them its meaning, all their activities would be fulfilled?
“The householder Dhṛtisena then went alone to an isolated place, an
while thus contemplating, a deity appeared and said
‘Householder, there is a thus-gone one called Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa.
“The householder Dhṛtisena was instantly elated
whereupon the god said
‘However, householder, he has passed away.
The householder Dhṛtisena then started to cry bu
the deity then asked him
‘Householder, why were you first elated, but now you cry?
the householder Dhṛtisena replied
“ ‘Well, god,’ ‘I was elated because you said there was a thus-gone one, an
I’m crying because you said he has passed away
Deity, since I have never seen a thus-gone one, my life is meaningless.
“The god then said to the householder Dhṛtisena
‘Householder, there is a Dharma preacher monk called Prabhakīrti, who was authorized when the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa passed away
Householder, that preacher retains the entire Dharma taught by that blessed one, without squandering any of it
Householder, that monk retains that thus-gone one’s treasury of Dharma.
the householder Dhṛtisena asked the deity
“ ‘Where, god, does that Dharma preacher now dwell?
“The god replied
‘Householder, the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti dwells in the town of Kapilavāstu, in the king’s palace
The king’s palace is , leagues to the east of here.
“After spending the night there, the householder Dhṛtisena then set out for the palace of the king of Kapilavāstu, carrying eight hundred million cowrie shells and eight hundred million ounces of gold. Once he arrived there
he went to where the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti was, bowed to his feet, and sat to one side
Once the householder Dhṛtisena was seated, the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti delivered a Dharma discourse that resolves the doubts of all beings, a Dharma discourse that perfectly satisfies all beings, a fine speech that perfectly inspires roots of virtue among bodhisattvas
The householder Dhṛtisena, who by now had developed devotion for the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti, praised his speech and offered to him all the cowrie shells and gold
He also offered himself to serve and attend upon Prabhakīrti
“Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Dhṛtisena was perseverant in serving and attending upon the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti and in pursuing the Dharma
such that he attended upon him for six hundred million years in order to receive, write down, and recite that very Dharma discourse
But for the entire six hundred million years, he never again received that Dharma discourse to listen to, write down, or expound upon
Throughout those six hundred million years that he served the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti he was never impeded by either sloth or sleep
Throughout those six hundred million years of his service to the Dharma preacher he never ever parted from the Dharma
Throughout those six hundred million years of his service to the Dharma preacher he never had a thought of desire, ill will, or aggression toward him
Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Dhṛtisena would not sleep at the threshold of wherever the Dharma preacher was staying but
in order to protect him, would stand at attention without lying down
“Śāradvatī­putra, once a māra named Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin appeared
Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin was seeking to bring the householder Dhṛtisena down
Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin thus conjured up as an emanation a monk looking exactly like the monk Prabhakīrti making the acquaintance of a woman
Having conjured up that emanation, Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin said to the householder Dhṛtisena
‘Householder, look at the erroneous thinking and impropriety of that teacher of yours, the famed scholar among teachers, insightful, learned, a veritable ocean of learning
How can he preach to others that they should observe abstinence, and yet indulge in the very perversion of discipline
Look, householder, at how he, although promoting pure conduct, indulges in fornication
Householder, how, in doing such things and behaving in such a way, could his conduct be profound and in observance of abstinence
It is impossible! It is improper
Householder, enough with attending upon him and serving him
Abandon such a monk
Householder, you have discipline, contentment, isolation, mindfulness, and insight
And so, since he is someone with perverted discipline
how can you serve him?
“The householder Dhṛtisena now thought
‘I was inspired by what the god told me about how Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa had authorized a Dharma preacher called Prabhakīrti to uphold the treasury of his Dharma, telling me that I should attend upon him
Accordingly, I went to the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti an
he perfectly taught me the Bodhisattva Collection of teachings that resolves all doubts and perfectly satisfies all beings
Out of desire for the Dharma, I then made offerings and also offered myself to serve and attend upon him
If I have acted properly, then the words that this person is saying about the impropriety of the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti are the action of Māra
And why
Because otherwise such behavior would be unthinkable and out of the question
For it is impossible that someone who has been authorized by a thus-gone one would display such comportment
there is no doubt about it, so this must be a māra, a god from the māra realm, or a person inspired by Māra
Since the Dharma teaching that I received from the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti showed the absence of characteristics
so should I now regard that woman and the qualities of that woman, and that man and the qualities of that man
If the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti is authorized by a thus-gone one, but I fall under the sway of that improper apparition
I will be denigrating the thus-gone ones and the nature of the thus-gone ones
I will thus invoke the power of truth through the power of aspirations from my own positive intention, and the power of truth of the thus-gone ones.
“The householder Dhṛtisena then invoked the power of truth, saying, ‘Through the truth and the true words of my exalted intention to pursue the Dharma, if the Dharma preacher was authorized by a thus-gone one to teach the Dharma, may that man and woman vanish!
“Śāradvatī­putra, through the householder’s true resolve the woman and man vanished
Once those beings belonging to the realm of Māra had vanished
the householder Dhṛtisena thought
‘The fact that the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti has never again let me listen to the Dharma discourse that perfectly satisfies the wishes of all beings is my own workings of Māra
It is due to the power of Māra
for while I have followed him constantly, intent in the pursuit of Dharma
he has not permitted me to listen to the Dharma discourse of the Bodhisattva Collection
Alas! I will now ensure that I do not fall under the sway of the workings of Māra!
Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Dhṛtisena thus did not turn away, but continued to follow the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti
“Look at the householder Dhṛtisena’s excellent, exalted motivation, Śāradvatī­putra
He took delight in following the Dharma preacher for six hundred million years. An
although he faithfully, and without any dissatisfaction
followed him for six hundred million years, he only heard that Dharma discourse one single time
Although the māra Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin had conjured up that delusive apparition
he did not change his mind, but became even more truly devout toward that Dharma preacher
After the entire period of six hundred million years had passed, the householder Dhṛtisena was reborn in the world of Ratnākara , which was in harmony with a thousand buddha realms
The thus-gone one Mahāskhanda also appeared in that world
Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Mahāskhanda had an assembly of six hundred million worthy ones
“The bodhisattva great being Dhṛtisena was born into the household of a king
Immediately upon birth, the gods said
‘Child, this fruition of yours is a result of pursuing the Dharma.
“Immediately upon hearing those words, the child thought
‘Then I must make sure to pursue nothing but the Dharma!
So when he was only seven years old he went forth, an
the blessed Mahāskhanda taught him the Dharma
By the power of his previous aspirations and by the power of the Thus-Gone One, he also obtained the power of recollection
He completely retained all the myriad Dharma discourses that the thus-gone one Mahāskhanda taught
He also practiced pure conduct under the teaching of the blessed thus-gone Mahāskhanda
He ripened immeasurable, countless beings for unexcelled and perfect awakening
“As soon as he died, he immediately entered into the service of a second thus-gone one called Sumeruskandha
At seven years old he went forth under that thus-gone one’s teaching
Having thus gone forth
he obtained the power of recollection, and through the power of his previous aspirations and the blessings of the Thus-Gone One, he was able to recollect all the myriad sūtras that the Thus-Gone One had taught
Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dhṛtisena consecutively served six hundred forty million buddhas and retained the Dharma taught by them all
Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dhṛtisena came to possess an oceanic wisdom
Since it was unwavering, he came to possess an unadulterated, space-like wisdom
Since it was difficult to fathom its depths, he came to possess a profound wisdom
Śāradvatī­putra, you should not think that the householder called Dhṛtisena was someone else
for the householder merchant whose mind did not change even after following the Dharma preacher for six hundred million years was Dīpaṃkara
“Śāradvatī­putra, consider how beneficial bodhisattva great beings’ exalted intention to pursue the Dharma is
Śāradvatī­putra, in this way, bodhisattva great beings who possess that exalted intention will swiftly awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
Śāradvatī­putra, that Dharma preacher is still pursuing the blessed ones’ sublime Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, that Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti dwells in this very retinue.
This concludes the sixth chapter
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are three things that bodhisattvas should do, in terms of which to consider correctly everything there is to do and not to do
What are these three things
Śāradvatī­putra, they are as follows
“Because of the very things not to be done, the first thing to do is to pursue the sublime Dharma fully
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas should furthermore pursue the teachings of the buddhas without measuring them
so that even when they hear the profound teachings of the buddhas
they will be unafraid, enthusiastically try to penetrate to their depths, and not abandon them
“Śāradvatī­putra, the second thing they should do is not to go back on their perfect exalted intention, which increases the more they hear the profound Dharma
This they should regard as being the perfect exalted intention of bodhisattvas
“Śāradvatī­putra, the third thing they should do is not to cower, be discouraged, or turn away when hearing a bodhisattva great being tell someone who has approached them, ‘A bodhisattva who has engendered the attitude set on unexcelled and perfect awakening must abandon all possessions. There is nothing that the bodhisattva does not give away.
This too they should regard as the perfect exalted intention of bodhisattvas
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone approaches a bodhisattva and says, ‘A bodhisattva who has engendered the attitude set on unexcelled and perfect awakening should provide comfort to all beings
Thus, since I, suffering in this way, am severely suffering, then you should first provide comfort to me, an
then later provide comfort to all other beings.
Hearing such a demand, bodhisattvas should be able to ensure that person’s happiness without being discouraged
However, if they fail and become discouraged and dejected, thinking, ‘If I cannot even provide comfort to this being, what use is it for me to do so for all beings,
then such discouragement should be regarded as not being an exalted motivation
“If, Śāradvatī­putra, while providing comfort to such beings
bodhisattvas are criticized and reviled, and berated with evil, harsh words, unsuitable for polite society
those bodhisattvas should not be angry, or have ill will toward them, but engender feelings of love and compassion for them
Bodhisattvas should provide for their happiness, so that they do not suffer
Śāradvatī­putra, such an exalted intention of bodhisattvas should be known as unexcelled and perfect awakening
“Bodhisattvas who arouse a gentle and peaceful mind and the intention to comfort others will see to the cutting of immeasurable saṃsāra into pieces
They will see to providing comfort to immeasurable beings
They will see to the ripening of their own buddha qualities
Each time they give rise to the mind of awakening, they will see to the accomplishment of immeasurable buddha qualities
In that way, bodhisattvas should be regarded as possessing an exalted intention and being skilled in methods
“Suppose that bodhisattva great beings are criticized and reviled, and berated with evil, harsh words, unsuitable for polite society, by the being on whose behalf those bodhisattvas have provided comfort. In such a case, bodhisattvas who do not neglect or diminish their altruistic intention will exercise patience, thinking
‘This being is teaching me buddha qualities
So if I were to have any ill will whatsoever toward him
I would be impeded from awakening by precisely that much.’ Such thinking should be regarded as the bodhisattvas’ exalted intention that is skilled in the methods toward unexcelled and perfect awakening
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone approaches a bodhisattva and says, ‘Unexcelled and perfect awakening is difficult to attain
you will not be able to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
you will not be able to accomplish the buddha qualities.
If bodhisattvas, upon hearing that, let go of the ideas they had
this should be regarded as not being the exalted intention
And if in such a case they imagine that the buddha qualities, which are so difficult to attain, are easy to attain, that should also be regarded as not being the exalted intention
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone approaches a bodhisattva and says, ‘Noble son, if one who gives rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening has no control over even their own body and life force
then there is no need to speak of them having control over their possessions
Alas, noble son, since it is impossible for you to have control over your body and life force, give up this attitude!
“Bodhisattvas might then think
‘No one has control over the body and life force, and because they do not have control over them, everyone strives to protect them
While striving to protect them, their bodies perish and cease to be, and their life forces too come to an end
That being the case, there is no question that mine will too.’ Such thinking should be regarded as not being endowed with the exalted intention, and not being skilled in methods
“Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas might also think
‘Everyone strives to protect their body and life force, bu
they have no control over them
The bodies over which they have no control will perish and cease to be
Then they will be oppressed by the torments of birth, aging, sickness, death, and the like, fo
by striving to protect their bodies, they will have formed many different kinds of karma
So even as they try to protect their bodies and life force
they still migrate to another body and another life force
Should I have regard for my body and life force and try to protect them, the
by so doing I will commit evil deeds and come to experience suffering in saṃsāra, with its five destinies
Alas, I will thus give up all concern for my body and life force
I will not protect them
I will also abandon my body and life force
I will act for the wisdom of awakening, and not for my body and life force
I will act striving to liberate all beings
I will rid myself of craving for body and life force
I will take up craving for all the blessed buddhas
I will aspire for the unborn
I will not be weary in teaching the Dharma
I will teach the Dharma that is unbounded and unreleased!
“Bodhisattvas may also consider this as follows
‘I will tell that person this: “Listen, the very absence of control over body and life force is itself the supreme effort
It is itself the supreme armor
That is because all phenomena are indeed without intrinsic nature
All phenomena are indeed without foundation.” 
Those who say such things should be regarded as possessing the exalted intention
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose a person were to approach a bodhisattva and say, ‘One who gives rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening must act as a student of all beings, so henceforth you must act as my student.
“Bodhisattvas might then reply, ‘Listen, I am not just your student
I am the student of all beings
That is because I have taken on the burden of beings
That burden includes the burden of health, the burden of not being fatigued, the burden of happiness, the burden of gaining importance, the burden of the thus-gone ones’ teaching, the burden of listening to the sublime Dharma, the burden of accomplishing the Dharma received, and the burden of becoming liberated
Such being the burdens, they fatigue neither body nor mind
Originating neither with oneself nor others, they bring pain to neither oneself nor others. That being the case
when you tell me to become the student of yourself alone
I will ask you what you need
If you say that you need my body and life force, the
I will grant you my body and life force. Bu
I will not abandon you
You should not give rise to the idea that phenomena, which are without owner and lord, have a lord
Once you have given rise to the idea of a lord, and then commit negative deeds based on that
you will be propelled by negative actions toward unfortunate destinies
In those unfortunate destinies you will be miserable, performing negative actions
If you do not agree, then just do as you please!
“Śāradvatī­putra, if bodhisattvas observe such disregard for body and life force, then
Śāradvatī­putra, their exalted intention should be regarded as unexcelled and perfect awakening, fo
it approaches unexcelled and perfect awakening
sustains their unexcelled and perfect awakening
keeps saṃsāra at a distance
approaches omniscient wisdom
ripens beings
purifies buddha realms, an
cultivates their roots of virtue
“As a simile, Śāradvatī­putra
suppose a jeweler finely polishes a priceless, precious gem, so that it becomes correspondingly dazzling and pristine
Thinking that the king will grant him a gift for this
the jeweler might then set his eyes on his perfect possession
He might then also receive a fine reception from the king or from other experts and show them the precious gem’s qualities
The king, prince, ministers, and experts will then be elated upon seeing the precious gem, delighting in its qualities. Likewise
Śāradvatī­putra, as much as bodhisattva great beings remain in the discernment of equanimity, to that degree they cultivate the wisdom of awakening, their own roots of virtue
They too will be able to grant gifts and encounter the blessed buddhas
The blessed buddhas will instruct them an
they will cause all beings to progress
“As another simile, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose that someone were to grow a medicinal tree
The medicinal tree would develop precisely to the extent that the person digs out a hole for it and waters the tree at the proper times, and protects it from the threats of deer, birds, and wind
Once it has fully grown
it would then be able to prevent and cure the illnesses of immeasurable, countless beings, and enable healthy beings to progress. Likewise
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas develop buddha qualities precisely to the extent to which they give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening; develop roots of virtue; pursue knowledge of the Dharma; strive in pursing the Dharma; and likewise, protect against the workings of Māra and the afflictions
Once they have fully developed such qualities
they vanquish the illnesses of immeasurable, countless beings and apply the salve of wisdom; an
once they have fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
they enable beings with and without afflictions, including the worlds of gods, humans, and demigods, to progress
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone were to approach a bodhisattva great being and say
‘One who has given rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening will be born in the hells
This is because, noble son, bodhisattvas will be reborn in the hells innumerably many times, precisely to the extent that there are beings there to liberate
They alone will need to experience the suffering of all those beings
Accordingly, I must experience my own suffering alone, wherea
you alone must experience the suffering of giving rise to the mind set on omniscient wisdom, fo
you will experience suffering if you are to liberate all beings
If you give it up
then you will be able to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.
“If bodhisattvas, upon hearing these discouraging words, embrace them and become discouraged, thinking, in a state of fear and anxiety, that this is something they cannot do
that should be regarded as not being the exalted intention
Instead, bodhisattvas should have the following attitude
‘If, through being born in the hells, I were to ripen the beings there and lead them toward unexcelled and perfect awakening and freedom from the fears of the hells, the
for the sake of each being I would gladly accept birth in the hells for immeasurable, countless eons
[That is because, ]as a thus-gone one having fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and possessing, accordingly, the wisdom, strength, and fearlessness of a buddha, [I would instruct beings to destroy their desire, anger, and delusion, and thus bring an end to the succession of countless heaps of afflictions, and bring an end to the beginningless succession of the myriad of beings, protect them for immeasurable eons, and enable beings to attain the happiness that is itself free of desire—
That is because, [as a thus-gone one having fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and possessing, accordingly, the wisdom, strength, and fearlessness of a buddha, ]I would instruct beings to destroy their desire, anger, and delusion, and thus bring an end to the succession of countless heaps of afflictions, and bring an end to the beginningless succession of the myriad of beings, protect them for immeasurable eons, and enable beings to attain the happiness that is itself free of desire
in light of such a sequence of events, I would delight in dwelling in the hells for immeasurable, countless eons.
If bodhisattvas are not discouraged by such a prospect, do not retreat from it, and do not have a negative idea about it, then
Śāradvatī­putra, those bodhisattvas should be understood to be free of laziness and in possession of the exalted intention
Śāradvatī­putra, would you like to hear about the bodhisattvas’ exalted intention in greater detail?
“Indeed, Blessed One, I would
Blessed One, please tell me right away
Blissful One, please elaborate right away
Blessed One, please elaborate on the exalted intention of bodhisattvas, which allows bodhisattvas to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.
The Blessed One then told the following story
“Śāradvatī­putra, immeasurably vast and countless beyond countless eons ago, there appeared in the world a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone wise and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman taming beings, an unsurpassable one, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha called Guṇarājaprabha
That blessed one had eighty-four thousand assemblies of great hearers and eighty-four thousand assemblies of bodhisattvas
Each one of those hearer assemblies had eight hundred forty million worthy ones, an
each one of those bodhisattva assemblies had eight billion four hundred million bodhisattvas
That blessed one’s students were double the number of worthy ones of the hearer vehicle
“Śāradvatī­putra, at that time there was a prince called Smṛtilābha
Once, Prince Smṛtilābha went to where the blessed thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha was
Having approached him, he bowed to the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side
While Prince Smṛtilābha sat there he had the thought
‘How amazing is the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Guṇarājaprabha, who possesses such vast qualities
What kind of wisdom does the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha possess, and how is such wisdom to be accomplished
I will make a request to the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha in melodious verses.
He thus posed the following questions to the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha using verses replete with devotional sentiment
“ ‘Seeing a buddha, the best among humans, Inspiration is born in me—I long for awakening
You see the infinite actions beings have performed
How will I reach the ambrosia of the supreme vehicle
“ ‘Supreme Victor, your supreme body is like the moon amidst the stars
Supreme Victor, with supreme miracles you teach the Dharma always
Your insight is supreme, like the lord of the divine abodes
Omniscient Guṇarājaprabha, lord, supreme among men, I ask you
“ ‘Your wisdom is unobstructed, stainless, pristine
It knows the three times without impediment
Supreme among beings, exalted lord, great sage
Your mastery extends to everything
“ ‘You have seen buddhas in the past
You have requested the supreme awakening. Please tell, King of Dharma, About the supreme wisdom you received then for the sake of awakening
“ ‘You who see without hindrance, I ask, How does one reach sublime and supreme awakening, Become a refuge to all beings, And liberate them completely from death and birth?
“Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha then spoke these verses to Prince Smṛtilābha
“ ‘Prince, just as you have said, While accomplishing all actions with my mind
I have previously seen as many buddhas As there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
“ ‘Prince, I cannot say the names Of all the buddhas I have seen over that period
I have seen and received teachings from all those who lived, During as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges
“ ‘The thought that is the cause of awakening— “May I be a buddha, the best among humans!”— is born in you
Listen to the Dharma I will explain
Upon hearing it, apply yourself to its accomplishment
“ ‘Never be satisfied with generosity
Never be satisfied with discipline
Never be satisfied with concentration
Prince, always rely upon insight.
“Having thus briefly spoken in verse
He told the prince that for the sake of ripening others He would have to instruct him further
The prince remained, understanding with joy and devotion.
“ ‘Do not be content with generosity
Do not be content either with discipline
Do not be content with questioning
Wisdom will emerge from them
“ ‘That wisdom does not dwell as an object, For “dwelling in a place” also does not exist
By asking a complete buddha, You will attain wisdom
“ ‘Wisdom is not based in the eyes
For the eyes too are empty of essence
Since the eyes do not exist
The qualities of the buddhas are revealed
“ ‘The ears and nose are the same way, As are the tongue, body, and mind
They are all ever empty And they have no essence
“ ‘The four elements Are the state of the unborn mind
The body comes from imagination
And imaginings too do not exist
“ ‘Without dwelling on the body, Without dwelling on life force, And without dwelling on possessions
One can realize that awakening
“ ‘Apply renunciation constantly
Rely upon diligence constantly
Abandon desires constantly
You should not travel to bad destinies
“ ‘Even were you to practice generosity For the sake of all beings
You should not conceptualize any beings, Nor dwell on any generosity at all!
“Śāradvatī­putra, Prince Smṛtilābha then replied in verse to the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Guṇarājaprabha
“ ‘You who have risen above the circuit of saṃsāra, Please resolve my hesitation, remove my doubt
Through the Victorious One having taught me the Dharma here
Many qualities are brought together for me
“ ‘According to the Dharma taught here by the Protector of the World
I believe that all the fetters of Māra will be cut And I will attain supreme awakening
I believe I will reach the essence of awakening
“ ‘Through this Dharma taught here by the Protector of the World, I believe I will show miraculous displays
I believe I will shake the earth
I believe I will gather a vast saṅgha
“ ‘I believe I will give up my life today
I believe I will attain nirvāṇa now
All phenomena being empty, I do think that these will be quelled today
“ ‘I long for the exhaustion of all these phenomena
The exhaustion of phenomena is not perceived anywhere at all
You have taught that the nature of everything is exhausted and empty
I long for the nature of the exhaustion of all natures
“ ‘I will go to my parents, Beg for their forgiveness, and then return
Constantly pursuing the Dharma of the buddhas, I will go forth in the teachings!
“He then bowed to the feet of the Thus-Gone One, Circumambulated the Victorious One three times, And set out to see his parents
Yet an evil māra, sitting by the roadside, [thought: “ ‘This prince has here set out for awakening. He wishes to go forth under the Victorious One. So I should seek out his weak point today. I will rouse in him complete delusion today.’

“Seated on the road, he asked the prince
‘Prince, where are you coming from
Why are you going so quickly
Sit for a moment! I will ask you something!
“The prince said to the man
‘I have just paid my respects to a buddha
He taught me the supreme of all dharmas, An
I will now cultivate that Dharma of the buddhas.
“ ‘Prince,’ said the māra, ‘your application of effort In pursuit of the Dharma of the buddhas is outstanding
But if you desire by all means to go forth
Partake of desires now and go forth later
“ ‘You have obtained vast pleasures and a kingdom
It is not suitable to have regret upon going forth, Thinking, “I did not indulge in fine pleasures at all!” Thus
first indulge in pleasures, and then go forth
“ ‘Your pleasures are grand and your kingdom supreme
Such excellent leisure is difficult to obtain
If you go forth without having indulged in these pleasures
Prince, you will regret it later.
“The prince replied to the māra
‘I will not be happy indulging in desire
Since it is the futility of desire that has been extolled
It is you who dwell in a misconception
“ ‘That which is hard to attain while lacking freedom, Is difficult to practice nowadays
So, having obtained leisure, I will practice the Dharma And instantly go forth
“ ‘I see this desire realm as faulty And
likewise, I see the form realm as faulty
I also see the formless realm as faulty
Yet I see the peace of nirvāṇa as faultless
“ ‘Having pursued the uncompounded Dharma
I will be of vast benefit to people, Liberate them from the torment of aging and sickness, And prevent them from rushing into further existences.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the māra Muṣitasmṛti then said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, you have said you will pursue the Dharma of the buddhas. that being the case
Prince, since I desire your benefit, welfare, success, and happiness, I will instruct you
If you follow m
it will be to your benefit.
“Śāradvatī­putra, Prince Smṛtilābha replied to the māra Muṣitasmṛti
‘Fine, then teach me
Upon hearing, I will judge!
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Noble son, you should first make a promise
When you have done so, I will instruct you.
“The prince replied
‘Did I not tell you, “Fine, then teach me! Upon hearing, I will judge” ?
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, you should not say, “Upon hearing, I will judge.
Prince, you should rather say, “Teach me and I will do as you say!” 
the prince retorted
“ ‘Listen,’ ‘you should not ask me to follow your words at all costs
[This is because ]if you present non-Dharma as the Dharma, or the Dharma as non-Dharma, [I will reject it once I so analyze it. On the other hand, if you teach what is true, I will accept it.
[This is because if you present non-Dharma as the Dharma, or the Dharma as non-Dharma, ]I will reject it once I so analyze it. [On the other hand, if you teach what is true, I will accept it.
This is because [if you present non-Dharma as the Dharma, or the Dharma as non-Dharma, I will reject it once I so analyze it. ]On the other hand, if you teach what is true, I will accept it
That being the case, it is only wise to say, “Upon hearing it, I will judge.
This is how the circumspect behave
It is an act of careful investigation
Asking me to follow your words at all costs is not how the circumspect behave, nor is it praised by the wise. Rather
it is the workings of a māra, and not the activity of a buddha
It would therefore be improper if I had to go back on my former promise in case you were to give me non-Dharmic advice. So, I will not promise that at all costs
Thus, seeing those faults, I will not say absolutely whether or not I will follow your teaching.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti thought
‘Since the prince will not say definitively whether he will follow my teaching or not, I should make a plan.
So, in order to confuse Prince Smṛtilābha, he said, ‘Excellent
Prince, this is the action of the wise
Prince, excellent, excellent that you will not say absolutely whether you will follow my teaching
Prince, I will instruct you anyway and then you will understand
Prince, do not rely on something that you see as full of faults!
replied the prince
“ ‘Listen, you should not put it like that,
‘And why not
Because one should neither rely upon what is full of faults, nor on what has only a few faults
a little poison kills a person just as much as a lot of poison does
Poison mixed with the food of an ordinary person kills, just as poison mixed with the food of a universal monarch kills—neither is fit to eat and neither should be relied upon
Likewise, if someone says, “Do not rely on what is full of faults! Rely on what has only a few faults!
one should actually not rely upon either
What, then, should the wise rely upon
They should reply upon what is flawless, utterly flawless, free of degeneration, free of anguish, free of distress, unmoving, soothing, and blissful.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then thought
‘Prince Smṛtilābha finds faults in all the instructions that I put forth and then gives a response.
Pondering thus, he said
‘Prince, you have excellently said, “The wise delight in what is free of anguish, flawless, and tranquil.
Well, Prince, the conduct of bodhisattvas has many faults
Those faults are the faults of births, destinies, saṃsāra, attachment, anger, untimely requests, and giving up pleasing objects, the last of which involves the fault of giving away eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body
The conduct of a bodhisattva thus involves a great many faults
If one does not give rise to the mind set on awakening, the faults are fewer, s
it is excellent that you think that whether something has many or few faults, neither should be relied upon
Prince, I did not know how circumspect and wise you are
I have seen your extremely fine, exalted intention, and what I said before was forgetful of that
Indeed, since both involve a fall into error, one should neither rely on something with many faults nor on something with few faults
Prince, the main point here is just this
nirvāṇa is the abandonment of all aggregates
Prince, what is the benefit of repeatedly experiencing the faulty existences of saṃsāra where one will have to repeatedly die? Rather
you should aspire for nirvāṇa
Prince, for beings to dwell in the womb is suffering
Separation from the desirable and encountering the undesirable is suffering
Prince, to take the body, which is without essence and impermanent, to be one’s leader is suffering
The impermanence of the life force is suffering
The impermanence and essencelessness of pleasures is suffering
Prince, dying over and over again is suffering
Prince, that is why I say to you, the appearance of a thus-gone one, the obtainment of a human birth, excellent leisure, and unexcelled faith in a thus-gone one’s teaching are difficult to obtain
Therefore, Prince, having obtained these things, do not throw them away
Prince, since those are the points that I wished to teach and explain, and that you wished to respond to, you have listened
Since you have stayed for what I have taught
that is your instruction, so you can listen and judge!
“Prince Smṛtilābha replied to the māra Muṣitasmṛti
‘I rejoice in you
I strongly rejoice in what you said about birth, old age, sickness, and death being suffering, and likewise, about how everything up to turning repeatedly in saṃsāra is the same
You also said, “May you swiftly reach nirvāṇa.
Upon hearing your words my compassion for beings welled up
As beings are repeatedly tormented by birth, old age, sickness, and death
I hope that I may fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and thus free them from the fears of birth, old age, sickness, and death, so that beings no longer repeatedly fall under their sway
Your instructions to me about the continued sufferings of saṃsāra once I have attained nirvāṇa were also amazing
Upon hearing them, compassion welled up in me for beings
So if I pass beyond suffering, who will be the protector and liberator of those beings?
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then asked Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Did you, or did you not say that even something with very few faults is not to be relied upon?
“ ‘That is right,’ Prince Smṛtilābha replied
‘even something with very few faults should not be relied upon
Thus, since unexcelled and perfect awakening is faultless, it should be relied upon.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, unexcelled and perfect awakening is indeed faultless
However, Prince, if even I could not attain it, how will you
Prince, I too thought in the past
“I will fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood!
I gave rise to such a perverse idea and immediately beggars came, who tormented and tortured me by asking for my head, hands, legs, eyes, ears, children, wives, enjoyments, vehicles, houses, harems, gardens, gems, pearls, cat’s eyes, conch shells, crystals, coral, wealth, grain, kingdom, and the rest
While undergoing such hardships and being forced to give up my possessions, rivers of blood flowed from my dismembered body, which tormented my mind
Consequently, I gave up on my giving rise to the mind of awakening
If you do not believe me, would you like to see that hardship of mine?
said Smṛtilābha
“ ‘Yes, I would like to see that, a
that will be to my benefit,
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti now thought
‘The bodhisattva Smṛtilābha does not believe in anything that I have done to thwart his resolve. However, he has now told me, “Show me what will be of benefit to me!” 
So the māra now manifested four rivers of blood before the prince
He also manifested four heaps of gold the size of snow mountains and a heap of devoured, bloody, and decomposing skulls the size of Mount Sumeru
He also manifested heaps of bones, as white as conch shells, the size of the other mountains
He manifested corpses with various dismemberments, such as dismembered hands, legs, ears, and other limbs and appendages, and in a variety of forms, such as the forms of humans, gandharvas, yakṣas, lions, tigers, horses, hares, monkeys, bears, leopards, boars, deer, hyenas, elephants, buffaloes, and more. He likewise manifested corpses in the forms of fish, sharks, porpoises, and crocodiles, and in the forms of geese, peacocks, crows, cuckoos, sparrows, pheasants, kuṇala birds, cranes, myna birds, and others
Some of the corpses had one mouth
Others had two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or upwards of a hundred thousand mouths. Some had one tongue, while others had two, three, four, five, or upwards of a hundred thousand tongues. There were also corpses with anywhere from one to a hundred thousand eyes
The corpses, moreover, all cocked their eyes and ears, chattered their teeth, and bit their lips, while the yakṣas stood at attention holding many different kinds of weapons in their hands
Having manifested such a cause of fright and terror as this
he said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, these are the rivers of blood
These are the four great mountains of bones.
said Smṛtilābha
“ ‘Yes, I see them,
continued the māra Muṣitasmṛti
“ ‘Prince,’ ‘these rivers of blood were formed from cutting off my limbs and appendages
Prince, do you see the four Mount Sumeru-sized mountains of skull bones?
“ ‘Yes, I see them.
“ ‘Those are all my heads that were cut off while I was practicing bodhisattva conduct
Do you also see the four mountains of corpses with dismembered hands, dismembered feet, eyes gouged out, and various limbs and appendages cut off?
“ ‘Yes, I do.
“ ‘Prince, those are the limbs and appendages I gave up while practicing bodhisattva conduct
Prince, do you see the armies of yakṣas in the four directions?
“ ‘Yes, I do.
“ ‘Prince, those frightful and terrifying beings are the ones who robbed me of vitality as I was giving rise to the mind set on awakening
They are the ones who requested everything from my head to my appendages as I gave rise to the mind set on awakening
Prince, while I was previously giving rise to the mind set on awakening, they did everything from requesting and cutting off my head to cutting off my limbs and appendages.
“Now the māra Muṣitasmṛti manifested a legion of rākṣasas and asked
‘Prince, do you see that legion of rākṣasas?
“ ‘Yes, I do.
“ ‘Prince, they rob the vitality from those who give rise to the mind set on awakening while they are dwelling in the womb
They divest the bodhisattvas of their life force even while they are dwelling in the womb
Prince, never at any time was I free from that suffering for as long as I was giving rise to the mind set on awakening
It followed me the whole time
Prince, it was because I could not endure that pain that I turned my mind away from unexcelled and perfect awakening
When I turned my mind away from awakening, I was free from that suffering and the harm subsided
Therefore, Prince, since I desire your welfare, benefit, success, and happiness, I implore you: Do not give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening
Prince, do not incur such suffering!
“Prince Smṛtilābha now thought
‘I have given rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening in the presence of the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha
But this person is trying to avert my resolve away from unexcelled and perfect awakening
This is unsuitable, if it is a māra in the guise of man, or someone inspired by a māra
But this person could also be a bodhisattva
Then, he would have become lazy and rejected the mind of awakening
For if this person has encountered such suffering, the
for all those beggars to come, from those requesting his limbs and appendages to those divesting him of his life force, he must have committed negative actions in the past
However, those beggars would only contribute toward my unexcelled and perfect awakening
This is because those beings are ignorant and perpetuate ignorance
Due to desire, anger, delusion, jealousy, and pride, they make untimely requests of the bodhisattva great beings
If I am able to perfectly satisfy those beings on the mundane level
I will also perfectly satisfy them accordingly on the supramundane level
Since this man lacks resolve, he is lazy, his diligence is weak, and he does not have an exalted motivation
Thus, he has turned away from unexcelled and perfect awakening
Alas, I must now ensure more than ever that I have the proper view
I will ensure more than ever that I adopt and practice diligence
Even should I lose my life force between each inhalation and exhalation of breath, I will not turn my mind away from unexcelled and perfect awakening
I will endure that many losses of my life force
I will not abandon the buddha qualities
[This is because, ]when it comes to beings who would deprive me of my life force, they only intend to harm me because they are under the control of afflictions. That is why they are predisposed toward negative deeds. For that reason, [I will don the armor of teaching them the Dharma that enables them to abandon the afflictions in order for them to attain unexcelled and perfect awakening.’
This is because, [when it comes to beings who would deprive me of my life force, they only intend to harm me because they are under the control of afflictions. That is why they are predisposed toward negative deeds. For that reason, ]I will don the armor of teaching them the Dharma that enables them to abandon the afflictions in order for them to attain unexcelled and perfect awakening.
“The bodhisattva Smṛtilābha then said to the māra Muṣitasmṛti
‘You really do want my benefit and welfare
You also want my success and happiness
For the things you have shown me are amazing
This is because, having seen such things, I will now don a much stronger armor and give rise to an exalted intention set on unexcelled and perfect awakening.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti now thought
‘Whatever frightful and terrifying things I show him, these only inspire him to don a much firmer armor.
So he told Prince Smṛtilābha
‘If you do not pay heed to my advice, then, as you must have reached your own understanding, I will now leave this place.
“After Muṣitasmṛti had said this, the yakṣas manifested by the māra said
‘Sir, if Prince Smṛtilābha does not act according to your advice
you should leave this place, an
we, being hungry and thirsty, will rob the prince of his vitality.
Others said
‘Sir, you should go
We will instantly pulverize this prince.
Others chimed in
‘We will request the prince for his head.
Still others suggested
‘Sir, you should go
He will not remain long an
his life force will cease to exist. Thus
what will it matter whether he heeds or trusts your words that seek his benefit and welfare
Because he will not act according to your advice
we will scatter his vitality even as he enters the womb
We will devour his flesh
We will drink his blood!
Others also shouted
‘Prince Smṛtilābha is unattended
Strike Prince Smṛtilābha! Strike him
Cut Prince Smṛtilābha! Cut him! Kill him!
“Muṣitasmṛti then replied to them
‘Wait, do not do that just yet
I will dissuade Prince Smṛtilābha from this evil view, so that he will act according to my words
I have been his companion for a long time
we were born together
You must wait for as long as it takes Prince Smṛtilābha to come to an understanding of the exalted intention
Protect me too in gratitude for what I have done
If you see that Prince Smṛtilābha does not give up that evil view, then after that you can do as you please
But if you see that I have been able to dissuade him from that evil view
you must be grateful for what I have done, and also show gratitude for the prince’s deeds.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the māra Muṣitasmṛti said twice to prince Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, follow my compassionate and beneficial words an
I will be your companion for as long as we shall live
Prince, what good to you is this evil view
Prince, give up this view
Prince, unexcelled and perfect awakening is difficult to attain
Prince, unexcelled and perfect awakening is extremely difficult to attain
Prince, do you want to see the other locations of the existences into which bodhisattvas are born?
“ ‘Yes, I would like that.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then manifested right on that spot the hell realms and asked Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, do you see the beings experiencing the many kinds of torments and sensations in those hells?
“ ‘Yes, I do.
“ ‘Prince, they all previously gave rise to the mind set on awakening
However, harmed by beggars, they produced feelings of miserliness and ill will and were therefore born into the hells
Prince, such is the destiny especially for those who give to beggars and have ill will
Those harboring ill will are born into such destinations
Prince, even if you have no ill will in your motive to give, then your next birth will be aborted a
these yakṣas will rob your vitality while you are still in the womb
Once you are born, moreover, they will cut off your limbs and appendages and take them away
Ask them, Prince, if you do not believe me!
“Prince Smṛtilābha then asked the hell beings
‘Noble sons, why were you born in these hells?
they replied
“ ‘Prince,’ ‘we had previously given rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening but
oppressed and tormented when beggars made demands of us, we became miserly and were born into these hell realms.
Others among them also said
‘Prince, previously we had given rise to the mind set on awakening, bu
when beggars therefore asked for our limbs and appendages, we got angry and were thus born into the hells
Prince, you should therefore do as this person advises you
It would not be good for you to be born here and later regret it.
“Prince Smṛtilābha then said to the māra Muṣitasmṛti
‘You do want my welfare, benefit, success, and happiness. The hells you have shown me and the beings who have embarked on the Bodhisattva Vehicle that you have shown me are amazing
Because of this, I will henceforth ensure that I am unflappable in my perseverance in anything that beings should request
I will solely provide them with everything
I will neither be angry nor have ill will
This is because being born into the hells is not the fruit of generosity, but the fruit of miserliness
Come with me! We should go together to where the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Guṇarājaprabha is
We should pay respects and make requests to the thus-gone one, the worthy one, that perfect buddha
We should accept whatever he says.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Noble son, what good will going to the Thus-Gone One do you
Prince, you go
I am not going
This is because it would not be right for me to go there and give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening.
“Prince Smṛtilābha then said to the māra Muṣitasmṛti
‘If you want my welfare, success, and happiness then come, let us go to the Thus-Gone One
Let us accept whatever he says.
He then repeated this, three times in all
“But the māra insisted
‘Enough, Prince
I have already done a lot of what he has advised
On precisely that account I have incurred great suffering. So I will not do as he advises.
“The prince then grabbed the māra Muṣitasmṛti by the hand and pulled him along, saying, ‘Come, let us go to where the Blessed One is!
shouted the māra Muṣitasmṛti
“ ‘Prince, go away!’ ‘You should not be a disciple
You will experience those heaps of suffering.
“Still, Prince Smṛtilābha went to where the Blessed One was. Approaching, he circumambulated the Blessed One and sat to one side
While seated there, he told the Blessed One all about the words he had with the māra on the road
The blessed thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha said to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Prince, well done, well done
That was the māra called Muṣitasmṛti, who came to confuse you and avert you from your resolve.
“Prince Smṛtilābha then went to the māra and said
‘Come, māra
Go for refuge in the Blessed One
Go for refuge in the Dharma
Go for refuge in the Saṅgha!
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti replied to Prince Smṛtilābha
‘Enough, Prince
I will not go for refuge in the Blessed One
I will not go for refuge in the Dharma
I will not go for refuge in the Saṅgha!’ Having thus spoken, the māra fell silent
“Then, by means of the blessing of truth, Prince Smṛtilābha looked at the māra Muṣitasmṛti
No sooner had he looked at him than he saw that spontaneously the māra Muṣitasmṛti’s hair had a seven day shave, and spontaneously he was wearing fine and soft ochre robes
and he saw that he was carrying a monk’s staff and an alms bowl
The māra Muṣitasmṛti, realizing that he had spontaneously gone forth and was carrying a monk’s staff and an alms bowl, said to the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha
‘Blessed One, someone who does not go for refuge to the Buddha, does not go for refuge to the Dharma, and does not go to for refuge to the Saṅgha, which of those truths does he seek?
“The Blessed One said to him
‘Muṣitasmṛti, who shaved your head
Who gave you ochre robes
Who gave you an alms bowl and a monk’s staff?
“The māra thought
‘Since I came, nobody shaved my head
Nobody gave me ochre robes, nor an alms bowl and a monk’s staff
I will toss these aside and go.
“But however much he wished to toss them aside there, he could not
He then thought
‘This retinue will criticize me and I will also be ashamed for as long as I stay here
I will thus vanish from here and return to my own place.
The māra Muṣitasmṛti then vanished from the retinue and returned to his own place
“Śāradvatī­putra, the goddesses of the māra class fled upon seeing the one who had gone forth and said
‘Who is this person with his head shaven and wearing Dharma robes
The appearance of such unprecedented features might kill us—how terrible!
“He replied to those in his retinue who had spoken thus
‘Patient ones, I am not a monk
I am the māra Muṣitasmṛti
In order to confuse someone I went before the thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha and th
Thus-Gone One transformed me into such a hideous figure.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the goddesses of the māra class then said
‘Only fools wear ochre robes, s
why do you thus speak so inconsistently
You have fallen from this abode of māras
Another māra has been born here.
“Śāradvatī­putra, upon hearing those words, the māra Muṣitasmṛti was anguished and sad, and cried out remorsefully with words of grief
He went to where the thus-gone one Guṇaprabha was and sat before the Blessed One
Then the blessed thus-gone one Guṇarājaprabha performed the magical feat by which the Hell of Incessant Pain was fully revealed
All the hell guardians present there rushed and darted around, bearing iron and brass hammers the size of Mount Sumeru that were flaring, burning, blazing, and completely engulfed in flames
They asked
‘Where has Muṣitasmṛti gone?
“Other hell guardians said
‘What good is he
We will fill his mouth with these metal hammers that are flaring, burning, blazing, and completely engulfed in flames.
Others chimed in
‘Friends, he has gone forth
Since he is liberated from the hells, do not do it!
Other hell guardians present there rushed and darted around, carrying mountains that were flaring, burning, blazing, and completely engulfed in flames
They asked
‘Where did Muṣitasmṛti go?
Others said
‘What good is he
We will pulverize him with these giant flaming mountains!
Others chimed in
‘Friends, he has gone forth
Since he is liberated from the hells, do not do it!
“Others rushed and darted around carrying razor blade-like knives, asking
‘Where did Muṣitasmṛti go?
Others said
‘What good is he
We will flay his body!
Still others chimed in
‘Friends, he has gone forth. He is tranquil and gentle
So since he is liberated from the hells, do not do it!
Others rushed and darted throughout the four directions carrying vases of molten copper on their shoulders, asking
‘Where did Muṣitasmṛti go?
Others said
‘What good is he
We will pour these vases of molten copper into his mouth and thus burn his lips, tongue, heart, small intestine, large intestine, stomach, and anus, forcing it to come out his hind end!
Others chimed in
‘Friends, he has gone forth under the teachings of the Blessed One
He is liberated from the hells.
“Other hell guardians rushed all around carrying many different kinds of weapons in their hands, such as spears, lances, javelins, iron arrows, bhalla arrows, clubs, swords, axes, pikes, and staffs. As they rushed and darted around carrying these weapons
they laughed ‘Hi hi’ and ‘Ha ha,’ whooped, cried out in pain, and made the noise of paṭaha drums; and as experts in wreaking terror
they clenched their teeth, disfigured their hands, cut off their heads, and contracted their faces with wrinkled brows, yelling
‘Seize, seize
Strike, strike
Cut, cut
Kill, kill!
They then asked
‘Where did Muṣitasmṛti go?
“Others asked
‘What good is he
We will cut up his body with these weapons drenched with the blood of enemies
We will destroy him
We will smash him to pieces
We will pulverize him
We are the henchmen of the Lord of Death!
Others chimed in
‘Friends, he has gone forth
Since he is liberated from the perils of hell, do not attack!
“Muṣitasmṛti then thought, ‘Hearing of such violence directed against myself, it is true that I have fallen from that place of māras
I will go forth and that going forth will be of great consequence
Even though hell guardians may pursue me they will not be able to smash me to pieces
If the thus-gone one Guṇaprabha were to allow me to go forth
I would go forth with an exalted intention and be fully liberated from those hells.’ Thinking this
he went to where Prince Smṛtilābha was and expressed that sentiment to him, saying
‘Prince, I wish to go forth with an exalted intention under the teaching of the Blessed One.
“Śāradvatī­putra, Prince Smṛtilābha then replied to the māra Muṣitasmṛti
‘Who gives you going forth
Come, Muṣitasmṛti! Give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening
Muṣitasmṛti, “going forth in the teaching” does not mean wearing ochre robes
Rather, what is called “going forth” refers to the path by which you should practice
Muṣitasmṛti, on that path you will perceive neither the hells, nor their perils.
“The māra Muṣitasmṛti then gave rise to an exalted intention to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening
With such a discerning focus on the Dharma and thus becoming expert in the Dharma, with his exalted intention he attained acceptance that phenomena are unborn
“Śāradvatī­putra, Prince Smṛtilābha caused the māra Muṣitasmṛti to give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening and acquire acceptance that phenomena are unborn
The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Guṇarājaprabha also prophesied that he would reach unexcelled and perfect awakening
Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that this is the bodhisattvas’ exalted intention, fo
it is such an excellent exalted intention that enables them to accomplish unexcelled and perfect awakening
“Śāradvatī­putra, if you have any doubt or hesitation, thinking that the prince from that time called Smṛtilābha was someone else, do not see it like that, Śāradvatī­putra
For, Śāradvatī­putra, at that time it was the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati himself who was the prince called Smṛtilābha
“Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva Smṛtilābha then visited his parents. Having arrived before them, he bowed his head to their feet, sat to one side, and said
‘Father, Mother, I wish to go forth under the auspices of the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Guṇarājaprabha.
Having said so, he then addressed his parents in verse
“ ‘The objects of desire were taught by the Victorious One to be impermanent
I will go forth under the auspices of the Victorious One
All happiness will come from that
You should not try to thwart me
“ ‘Whether you seek a kingdom and pleasures, Enjoyments and higher realms, Or qualities and wisdom
Go forth under the teaching of the Knower of the World
“ ‘That is where generosity and discipline ripen
Right there praise and good birth are found
That is where I will create a stable foundation
Based on that, I will become a king of Dharma
“ ‘This is the fruit of previous good deeds, Generosity, and gentleness
Now you enjoy their fruits, Father
Ensure that these fruits remain and go forth
“ ‘Otherwise, having used it all up you will travel to the unfortunate states— The three lower realms where you will find no leisure
And by engaging there in evil deeds, You will not encounter the buddhas
“ ‘Whereas those who go forth due to their remaining fruits, Will practice the Dharma intently
Leaving behind the eight unfree states, They will gain leisure in the teaching of the buddhas
“ ‘Upon seeing the buddhas, they will instantly have faith
And with a faithful attitude, they will act respectfully, And respectfully practice the Dharma
Practicing in accord with Dharma, awakening is attained without hardship
“ ‘May those who wish to abandon all unfree states, And who abandon evil companions, Go forth, the root of virtue, In emulation of me today
“ ‘There are no gods, yakṣas, or kiṃnaras, Nor efforts of gandharvas or nāgas That will thwart me today, By telling me, “Do not go forth, but stay in this household!
“ ‘I invite here, moreover, all evil deeds, As they are not able to prevent me
For instance, it is like how an elephant moves according to its whims, Once the tight fetters constraining it have been cut
“ ‘Likewise, having today cut through the tight fetters of wants, And the fetters of their basis, the creepers of craving, I will go forth
From that no force will prevent me!
“Having thus spoken, He immediately bowed to his parents’ feet. They were pleased an
out of respect they were not able to prevent him
They said, ‘Go forth under the Victorious One’s teaching!
“He thus went forth under the auspices of the Victorious One
Many tens of millions of beings heard him
Amazed with him, they acquired faith
And out of emulation, went forth in multitudes
“His companions that were present there— Merchant boys of equal fortune— Proclaimed, ‘My, the teaching of the buddhas is vast.
Thus many thousands of beings have gone forth
“The king then went forth too, Giving up the kingdom and his coveted enjoyments
Then eighty-seven quadrillion of his retainers Also went forth, following his example
“Seeing the king go forth, The queen also did the same
Next, eighty thousand daughters, Especially devoted to the king, also went forth
“Out of emulating the valiant Smṛtilābha, They all entered the supreme vehicle
The garland of his praiseworthy qualities was such That no one could match that valiant one
“Śāradvatī­putra, if you think that the king from that time called Kṛtādhikāra was someone else
do not see it like that
For, Śāradvatī­putra, at that time I was the king called Kṛtādhikāra
Prince Smṛtilābha was my son
“For a lifespan of twenty-one thousand years, The king together with his daughters and townsmen Practiced pure conduct
Then, when his lifespan had run out, he died
“At that time, the Teacher was teaching the assembly of monks
The best among humans smiled
Right there Buddha Guṇarājaprabha made a declaration About the aspiration that the king had
“He said, ‘The king first practiced pure conduct And then entered the most supreme of vehicles
He will henceforth not travel to unfree states, But find excellent leisure
“ ‘Having practiced for many eons
He will pay homage to countless buddhas, And thus appear in a good eon, During the time of the Victor, the best among humans Śākya Gomīrāja
“ ‘The prince and monk Smṛtilābha Will then be part of his retinue, Going forth during the time When Śākya Gomīrāja is the awakened one
“ ‘He will practice pure conduct, So tha
later, when he dies, He will also attain a human existence, And leave relics upon his passing
“ ‘When dwelling during the final days
He will listen to the Dharma of precisely this kind
He will spread my teachings— The discourses that I preach now
“ ‘Having utterly purified the unobstructed wisdom of awakening
The phrases he preaches communicating the supreme vehicle Will stay just so, and not change, So tha
later they will be exactly as they had been
“ ‘Those who, upon hearing such a Dharma as this, Become enraptured and faithful, Should never doubt that I, the Awakened One, Will see them here and make a prediction
“ ‘I, supreme king of Dharma, will see them
Those who have heard me teach the Dharma Will also, when confronted with great peril, Find acceptance of the profound Dharma
“ ‘I predict that monks, nuns, laymen, And laywomen, who are intelligent And long for such a Dharma, Will come to the supreme vehicle.
“Upon teaching this Dharma Seventy quadrillion beings Attained sublime and supreme vision And were predicted by the Victorious One to be steadfast bodhisattvas.
This concludes the seventh chapter
“Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas endowed with such an exalted intention should persevere in the correct view of sameness
Correct view means freedom from partiality
Alternatively, Śāradvatī­putra, correct view is so called because it sees correctly
Śāradvatī­putra, correct view is also so called because of sameness
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the eyes are nirvāṇa an
there is no nirvāṇa other than the eyes
The eyes and nirvāṇa are thus nondual, meaning indivisible into two
They are alike
How are they alike
They are alike in that the eyes and nirvāṇa are identical
The eyes are devoid of eyes
Nirvāṇa is devoid of nirvāṇa
The eyes are devoid of nirvāṇa
Nirvāṇa is devoid of eyes
The eyes and nirvāṇa are thus identical since neither ever existed
The same logic should also be applied to the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind
Thus, the mind and nirvāṇa are alike
How are they alike
They are alike because mind and nirvāṇa are identical
Mind is devoid of mind
Nirvāṇa is devoid of nirvāṇa
Mind is devoid of nirvāṇa
Nirvāṇa is devoid of mind
Mind and nirvāṇa are nondual, meaning indivisible into two
They are devoid of thought since they are nothing that can be examined
Being empty by way of emptiness
this, Śāradvatī­putra, is what is called the ‘correct view.
Since that view makes them the same, it is called the ‘correct view.
Since all these have come to be the same, it is called the ‘correct view.
What is its practice
It is what is devoid of practice
Śāradvatī­putra, wrong practice refers to not approaching those teachings, abandoning them, and not fathoming them
this, Śāradvatī­putra, is called wrong practice 
Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, the worst of wrong practices is to entertain concepts about such teachings
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the correct view is free of concepts
Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones and the learned noble hearers do not conceptualize earth
They do not conceptualize because of earth
They do not think, ‘Earth is mine.
Nor do they think, ‘I belong to earth.
The same applies to the elements of water, fire, and wind
They do not conceptualize anything, up to and including nirvāṇa
They do not conceptualize nirvāṇa
They do not think, ‘Nirvāṇa is mine.
Nor do they think, ‘I belong to nirvāṇa.
It is also taught, ‘They do not cling.
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, ‘correct view’ is not a view of anything
Śāradvatī­putra, all views are wrong views
Śāradvatī­putra, being without a view is the correct view
this, Śāradvatī­putra, is called the correct view
Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, the correct view cannot be taught in words
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, all the workings of speech come down to only words, and they are devoid of the correct view
Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, in this way the correct view accords with what is known by a thus-gone one, fo
he is utterly devoid of any wrong view
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the suchness of his speech is entirely the suchness of speech, in that his speech accords with how things are
That speech, Śāradvatī­putra, is inexpressible
That speech is undifferentiable
Reality, exactly as it is—that is how that speech is
“Śāradvatī­putra, that body is the body of suchness
Śāradvatī­putra, that which is called the body of suchness is the unmistaken body and the undifferentiable body
That body accords with that speech, exactly as it is
Śāradvatī­putra, that body is the action of suchness
Śāradvatī­putra, the action of suchness accords with unmistaken action and involves no other action than that. As such, that action is undifferentiable, and
Śāradvatī­putra, that action is the fruition of suchness
In that way, the fruition accords precisely with the action
Therefore, the Thus-Gone One correctly spoke the truth in saying, ‘When there is action, ripening follows
Thus, ripening happens precisely according to the action.
“Śāradvatī­putra, likewise, the movement of wisdom is wisdom
Śāradvatī­putra, it is not without wisdom
Thus, Śāradvatī­putra, when bodhisattvas are taught this, they are not frightened
They are neither terrified, nor will they become terrified
they are neither confused, nor bewildered
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four things that are beguiling
What are those four things
Śāradvatī­putra, relying upon, cultivating, and promulgating nirgrantha preachers and materialists is beguiling
Śāradvatī­putra, relying upon, cultivating, and promulgating wrong views is beguiling
Śāradvatī­putra, relying upon, cultivating, and promulgating those who uphold the practice of argumentation is beguiling
Out of lack of faith and wisdom, failing to revere or consider as definitive the profound sūtras, with their profound messages and emptiness, is beguiling
Śāradvatī­putra, these four things are beguiling, for it is not that they are not without deception
“To discard these four beguiling things, Śāradvatī­putra, one must cultivate and rely upon four unbeguiling qualities
What are those four qualities
To discard wrong views, one should cultivate the correct view
Śāradvatī­putra, the monk who observes propriety should not stay where the discourses of materialists are taught but immediately leave; this is the second quality that will enable one to abandon beguilement
Śāradvatī­putra, in addition a monk should not go anywhere he will encounter argumentation
or, alternatively, in order to pacify argumentation a monk may also go there, defeat those who preach non-Dharma, and then, in order to gather Dharma preachers, speak of reality. This would not be contrary to the Dharma, fo
bringing harmony to the saṅgha brings the abandonment of beguilement. This is the third unbeguiling quality
Śāradvatī­putra, finally, a monk should excellently receive such Dharma discourses as these, and having received them, he should observe their practice, such that he makes efforts to explain and recite them
he should also make efforts to keep them correctly in mind
Śāradvatī­putra, these four unbeguiling qualities bring the abandonment of beguilement
“Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas who observe propriety should make efforts not to form karma
Śāradvatī­putra, by excellently donning armor bodhisattvas should not be frightened
Śāradvatī­putra, by not discarding great diligence bodhisattvas should not discard their armor
Śāradvatī­putra, when bodhisattvas diligently receive the sublime Dharma, as well as its meaning, conduct, and wisdom, and then pose questions to my hearers, the Thus-Gone One is happy and filled with supreme happiness
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the lineage of the Buddha will then remain uninterrupted
“Śāradvatī­putra, the hearers should please bodhisattva great beings
Śāradvatī­putra, a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, who has recollected the Thus-Gone One or his qualities as well as the heaps of suffering from time immemorial, might delight bodhisattva great beings with as little as one four-line verse
By delighting them so, that person might lead them to retain it, and thus encourage them. If that noble child were to do so with the thought, ‘May their roots of virtue fully ripen, such that they accomplish the wisdom of awakening and become a buddha. And having become a buddha, may they teach the Dharma to dispel immeasurable, countless heaps of suffering,
Śāradvatī­putra, the heaps of that person’s merit would be immeasurable
Bodhisattvas who are led to retain just that single verse would also give rise to the exact same amount of merit
“Śāradvatī­putra, suppose that heap of merit were to assume form and
Śāradvatī­putra, suppose all the myriad beings of all four continents in the world, both past and future, were to attain a human body
Having acquired a human form, they might use vessels the size of Mount Sumeru to take away from that heap of merit
Śāradvatī­putra, in this manner, even if each one of those beings were to use a vessel the size of Mount Sumeru to take away from that heap of merit
I cannot say that the end of that heap of merit would ever be reached
Śāradvatī­putra, not to speak just of the world of four great continents
suppose all the myriad beings present throughout the trichiliocosm—beings with form, without form, with perceptions, without perceptions, or those with neither perception nor nonperception—both past and future, were to acquire human form and [take away from that heap of merit using vessels the size of Mount Sumeru.
[suppose all the myriad beings present throughout the trichiliocosm—beings with form, without form, with perceptions, without perceptions, or those with neither perception nor nonperception—both past and future, were to acquire human form and ]take away from that heap of merit using vessels the size of Mount Sumeru
Even according to that number, were each being to take away from that heap of merit using vessels the size of Mount Sumeru
I cannot say that the heap of merit would come to end
“Śāradvatī­putra, any monk, nun, layman, or laywoman among my hearers who delights bodhisattva great beings who have perfectly set out for unexcelled and perfect awakening and, causing them to receive the Dharma, encourages them and teaches them even as little as a four-line verse will attain an immeasurable heap of merit
“Suppose, Śāradvatī­putra, that a person, in order to bring about the maturing of such-and-such a bodhisattva great being’s factors of awakening, delights him with the gift of Dharma by teaching him some amount of the teachings of the buddhas, and leads him to understand them
The bodhisattva to whom that person had taught that much of the wisdom of the buddhas, even if the bodhisattva carries that teacher on his head or shoulders with all his might, and on the eve of the bodhisattva’s awakening as a result of that discourse to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, ripens that person, teaches that person the Dharma, and establishes that person in it, [would still not have succeeded in returning that person’s kindness;
[The bodhisattva to whom that person had taught that much of the wisdom of the buddhas, even if the bodhisattva carries that teacher on his head or shoulders with all his might, and on the eve of the bodhisattva’s awakening as a result of that discourse to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, ripens that person, teaches that person the Dharma, and establishes that person in it,] would still not have succeeded in returning that person’s kindness
for that bodhisattva great being possesses that much of the immeasurable teachings of the buddhas
Śāradvatī­putra, from this explanation, you should understand how bodhisattvas cannot repay the kindness of such a person
“Śāradvatī­putra, long ago, immeasurably vast and countless beyond countless eons ago, there appeared a thus-gone one called Saṃgupta
That blessed one’s lifespan was seventy thousand years
He had three hearer assemblies
The first had eighty million monks
the second had sixty million monks, an
the third assembly of hearers had forty million monks
Śāradvatī­putra, after the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Saṃgupta had passed away
the sublime Dharma remained for forty thousand years
When the sublime Dharma had declined to its final five hundred year period since that thus-gone one’s passing, there appeared a monk called Jñānottama, who was learned, wise, intelligent, and gentle
“Śāradvatī­putra, at that time here in Jambudvīpa there was a king called Ananta
That king had a palace called Nagarānanta, which was twelve leagues across. The palace was wealthy, prosperous, pleasant, abundant in food, delightful, and well populated
There was also at that time in Nagarānanta a householder called Akrodhana, and
Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Akrodhana had a son called Arthamati
Once, that merchant’s son, Arthamati, went to where the monk Jñānottama was. Once there the monk Jñānottama delivered a sermon about bodhisattvas
When the merchant’s son Arthamati heard the sermon from the monk Jñānottama he was delighted and became genuinely discerning
He then covered the monk Jñānottama with a precious religious robe worth tens of millions
Having covered him, he said to Jñānottama
‘Noble One, excellent, your eloquent speech was excellent
Please come again and again to my house and deliver sermons like that one! It will be beneficial to me
The gift of the venerable Dharma will bear great fruit
Henceforth, for as long as I live, I will treat you to religious robes, alms, bedding, medicines, utensils, other necessities, and much else
I will also invite as guests the monks that are your venerable followers.
“The monk Jñānottama replied to the merchant’s son Arthamati
‘Householder, what you have said is virtuous!
The merchant’s son Arthamati then bowed to the monk Jñānottama’s feet, circumambulated him, and departed from his company
“Śāradvatī­putra, subsequently the monk Jñānottama visited the house of the merchant’s son Arthamati
Śāradvatī­putra, the monk Jñānottama then established the parents, children, wives, male servants, female servants, workers, and day laborers of the merchant’s son Arthamati in unexcelled and perfect awakening
Śāradvatī­putra, through that root of virtue he too was never separate from the Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha, or spiritual friends for a countless eon
“Śāradvatī­putra, if you think that the merchant’s son Arthamati was someone else, do not see it like that
For at that time I was the merchant’s son Arthamati
Śāradvatī­putra, if you have any doubt or hesitation, thinking that the father of the merchant’s son Arthamati was someone else
do not see it like that
For the thus-gone one Kāśyapa was my father then
Śāradvatī­putra, if you think that the billions of beings present there were certain others
do not see it like that
For they are all destined for unexcelled and perfect awakening
Śāradvatī­putra, they are assembled in this very retinue and have been predicted by me to reach unexcelled and perfect awakening
“Śāradvatī­putra, the monk Jñānottama had attained at that very time complete nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there is no remnant of clinging
Śāradvatī­putra, had the monk Jñānottama not attained complete nirvāṇa through the Hearer Vehicle
how could the merchant’s son Arthamati have fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood through the massive heap of merit that came about through him teaching the Dharma, not to speak of his teaching of the Dharma to Arthamati’s parents and the entire circle of retainers
Śāradvatī­putra, what if the monk Jñānottama had not reached complete nirvāṇa
Śāradvatī­putra, I will not be able to repay that monk
Śāradvatī­putra, even were I to honor or worship him, I would not be able to repay the precise favor that he did for me by teaching me the Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that whoever delights bodhisattvas with a Dharma sermon, causes them to retain it, and thus encourages them will be replete with an immeasurable heap of merit
“Śāradvatī­putra, through immeasurable deeds the bodhisattva engenders the mind of awakening, accomplishes that mind, and stabilizes it
Śāradvatī­putra, let me give an analogy
When the ocean is steady, one can glean whether or not there are precious gems below that can be converted to wealth
one can know all the gems that are present in the ocean, and thu
one may hope to retrieve them from the ocean
In the same way, Śāradvatī­putra, when the bodhisattva’s mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening is steady, one can perceive that it is a receptacle of all the myriad kinds of wisdom that exist, whether mundane and supramundane, defiled and undefiled, reproachable and irreproachable, or compounded and uncompounded. It will serve as the abode of wisdom, one will acquire therein the distinction between all wisdoms, and all wisdoms will arise from it
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is also like the following analogy
One should understand that when the ocean itself is steady, it becomes an abode of the great elements for the bodies that grow inside it
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening is steadfast, it becomes an abode where unexcelled and perfect awakening, the great body of wisdom, grows, and where the many countless great elements of the great collection of roots of virtue develop
“Śāradvatī­putra, it should also be understood according to the following analogy: When the ocean itself is steady, the great nāga kings dwelling there are difficult to overcome for the garuḍas, the kings of birds. It is due to the great nāgas’ abode that they can emerge from the ocean and satiate the world of the four continents with great streams of rain
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by the bodhisattva is steadfast
other bodhisattva great beings awaken to it, so that it serves as a great abode for countless beings. It provides an abode for those qualities. It also provides an abode for the objects of the buddhas
Wicked māras cannot divert beings from it, easily overcome it, or defeat it
If māras form ill intentions, thinking that they will enact the workings of the māras, then immediately upon forming such an intention, all the māras’ fetters and intentions will be utterly destroyed
“It is also like the following analogy
It is difficult to divert the great nāgas from the oceans
Having emerged from the oceans, they satiate the world of the four continents with great streams of rain, such that medicines and forests grow and flourish there, and the thirst of those with two legs and those with four is quenched. Afterward, they once again plunge into the great oceans
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by the bodhisattva is steadfast, it becomes an abode for the nāga-like bodhisattva great beings. Having emerged from it, they bring down a rain of Dharma, a torrent of Dharma, whose source is the epitome of dispassion, upon the villages, towns, cities, countries, regions, and royal palaces throughout the trichiliocosm. Thus they utterly quench the craving of innumerably countless beings—the craving of beings in the desire realms, the form realms, and the formless realms
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is also like the following analogy
When the ocean itself is steadfast
the myriad great rivers present throughout the four continents all flow into it. Since the ocean gradually deepens, they have no other destination but there and yet the ocean neither depletes nor fills despite the fact that they flow into it—it is the very nature of the ocean to accommodate them
Along the same lines, the water of the ocean is also the waters that flow into it separately—it is the same water
Just as one should understand that those waters will all obtain the same salty flavor, so too, Śāradvatī­putra, [one should understand that ]when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, [once they are fully awakened and have become awakened thus-gone ones themselves, it becomes a receptacle for all buddha qualities in their entirety and for the perpetual insight of all beings. As soon as those who harbor a variety of doubts about the Dharma see such bodhisattvas, they will instantly be free of doubts and, regardless of their former names, henceforth be known as ‘the Thus-Gone One’s hearer.’
[Just as one should understand that those waters will all obtain the same salty flavor, so too, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, ]once they are fully awakened and have become awakened thus-gone ones themselves, [it becomes a receptacle for all buddha qualities in their entirety and for the perpetual insight of all beings. As soon as those who harbor a variety of doubts about the Dharma see such bodhisattvas, they will instantly be free of doubts and, regardless of their former names, henceforth be known as ‘the Thus-Gone One’s hearer.’
[Just as one should understand that those waters will all obtain the same salty flavor, so too, Śāradvatī­putra, ]one should understand that [when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, once they are fully awakened and have become awakened thus-gone ones themselves, ]it becomes a receptacle for all buddha qualities in their entirety and for the perpetual insight of all beings. As soon as those who harbor a variety of doubts about the Dharma see such bodhisattvas, they will instantly be free of doubts and, regardless of their former names, henceforth be known as ‘the Thus-Gone One’s hearer.
Śāradvatī­putra, accordingly, just as the ocean has a singular salty taste, so will his excellent hearers be liberated, and thus liberated, all have the same taste of liberation
“Śāradvatī­putra, along the same lines, as an analogy, when the ocean itself is steadfast
it has from the very beginning been gradually deepening
Since the ocean has formed from the very beginning with a descending floor
people who want the gems it contains cannot access them
Śāradvatī­putra, the ocean is steadfast with limitless depth and water
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, when the mind of awakening engendered by the bodhisattva is steadfast
it is steadfast from the very beginning as it continually deepens
As it gradually deepens infinitely, it is steadfast to the very depths
Śāradvatī­putra, this gradual deepening consists of accomplishment of the perfection of generosity, the perfection of discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, and the perfection of concentration
Śāradvatī­putra, its very depths should be understood as the bodhisattva’s perfection of insight
Śāradvatī­putra, its infiniteness should be regarded as the bodhisattva’s accomplishment of skill in means regarding the qualities of the buddhas. Thus
since the limit of reality is manifest from the very beginning, it would be improper were it not to be traversed, and were immeasurable, countless beings and those who want the jewels of the Dharma not to access it. Thinking this, one can transform one’s entire perspective through embarking on the descent, gradually deepening into it
“Śāradvatī­putra, along the same lines, for instance, when the ocean is steadfast
it is steadfast from the very beginning as the very home of all beings within it
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, when the engendered mind of awakening is steadfast
it is steadfast from the very beginning as the very home of all beings
“Śāradvatī­putra, along the same lines, for instance, when the ocean is steadfast
the island of gems is perpetually steadfast from the very beginning
Śāradvatī­putra, likewise, when the mind of awakening engendered by the bodhisattva is steadfast
this enables the gems of the applications of mindfulness, the authentic eliminations, the bases of supernatural power, the masteries, the powers, the branches of awakening, the concentrations, the liberations , the absorptions, and the attainments to be steadfast.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, this explanation of the bodhisattvas’ mind of awakening, which the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha has delivered is amazing! It is amazing how it was presented with such immeasurable eloquence along with analogies to the ocean!
The Blessed One said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One has provided what is a mere simile
Śāradvatī­putra, the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is not fully measured by the simile of the great ocean
Śāradvatī­putra, to refer to the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas takes immeasurable eloquence
Śāradvatī­putra, to refer to the Thus-Gone One takes not just one kind of eloquence, but immeasurabe eloquence
Why is that
It is because I explain the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas with immeasurable eloquence by referring to the steadfastness of the trichiliocosm
And why is that
It is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the steadfastness of the mind set on awakening is similar to that steadfastness
In this way, even were the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha to teach, starting from there, for an eon, more than an eon, or even longer than that, the topic of the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas would still not be exhausted or depleted
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is made steadfast by such activities that are hard to subdue; activities that are unparalleled; activities that are exalted, that bring happiness to beings, and that please beings; joyous activities; activities that involve the three realms; activities that involve great wisdom; activities that are difficult to fathom; activities of dispassion; and activities of great illumination
Śāradvatī­putra, in short, due to such activities it is impossible to conclusively account for the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
when the trichiliocosm is steadfast
that world system is steadfast for all the myriad beings that exist throughout the trichiliocosm to partake of
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast
it is stable in that it serves as a basis for immeasurable, innumerable beings to partake of wisdom
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
one should understand that when Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, is steadfast, it serves as the abode for many thousands of gods, and, dwelling there, the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three defeat the many armies of the demigods
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast
it becomes the abode of immeasurable, innumerable hearers
Just as the gods, while dwelling there on Mount Sumeru, defeat the armies of demigods, so too, Śāradvatī­putra, do other immeasurably many beings, while dwelling there within the mind of awakening, defeat the forces of Māra whose will is difficult to break
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
one should understand that when the Mahācakravāḍa Range, the kings of mountains, is steadfast, any being included therein is invulnerable to the swirling gusts of wind that course without impediment
Śāradvatī­putra, likewise, one should understand that this is similar to how, when the mind set upon unexcelled and perfect awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast
any being with a conception of this is included among bodhisattvas
Śāradvatī­putra, they are invulnerable to all the swirling gusts of wind of the afflictions
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
one should understand that when Mount Himavān, the king of mountains, is steadfast, it provides the basis for all medicines
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, the medicine of great wisdom is steadfast to perfectly eradicate the illness of afflictions for immeasurable, countless beings
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
one should understand that when the great source of gems is steadfast, it benefits, contributes to, and subsumes many hundreds of thousands of beings
Śāradvatī­putra, likewise, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, it benefits immeasurable, countless beings, and, in the same vein, it contributes to them through their enjoyment of the gems of Dharma
“Śāradvatputra, it is like this: As an analogy
one should understand that when the chariot of the sun and the sun that rides it are steadfast, they shine, bringing light and heat throughout the entire four continents
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the bodhisattvas’ engendering of the mind of awakening and their abode of great wisdom, which ride and abide in the Great Vehicle, are steadfast, they shine throughout the trichiliocosm
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
one should understand that when the abode of the nāga king Anavatapta is steadfast, Śāradvatī­putra, it enables that nāga king to dwell there and distribute the four great rivers throughout the four directions, and those rivers benefit all those with two legs or four legs who are imperiled by thirst; enable the growth of grains, medicines, trees, and forests; and replenish the ocean, the source of gems
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, [one should understand that ]when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, and bodhisattvas dwell within it, they fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. [At that point they distribute the four rivers of the Dharma—the river of genuine discrimination with respect to phenomena, the river of genuine discrimination with respect to meaning, the river of genuine discrimination with respect to language, and the river of genuine discrimination with respect to eloquence. With the waters of the precious Dharma, resounding with the sounds of emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and the eightfold path of the noble ones, and with the waters of the five masteries, five powers, and seven branches of awakening, they quench the thirst of the afflictions of many, immeasurable, countless beings. Then, just as the great rivers flow into the ocean, these waters come to replenish the great ocean of dispassion.
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, [one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, and bodhisattvas dwell within it, they fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.] At that point they distribute the four rivers of the Dharma—the river of genuine discrimination with respect to phenomena, the river of genuine discrimination with respect to meaning, the river of genuine discrimination with respect to language, and the river of genuine discrimination with respect to eloquence.

“Śāradvatī­putra, for as long as the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is steadfast, it abides by great activities, activities that are hard to take up, activities that match the matchless. Thus
Śāradvatī­putra, even the Thus-Gone One does not come close to describing them all in language
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that any noble son or daughter who delights a being with a sermon involving such a Dharma, and encourages them by compelling them to retain it, produces an immeasurably great heap of merit
Śāradvatī­putra, until reaching complete nirvāṇa the Thus-Gone One could not come close to describing the extent of that heap of merit, which will be accomplished according to the vehicle for which it was dedicated
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: As an analogy
the roots of virtue from a gift offered to a thus-gone one, or those engendered in relation to a thus-gone one, are not seen to come to an end in the interim until one has reached complete nirvāṇa
Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, the roots of virtue from delighting bodhisattvas with a Dharma sermon and compelling them to retain it are not seen to come to an end or reach completion in the interim until one has reached great, complete nirvāṇa
Śāradvatī­putra, it is according to that reckoning that one should understand this
“Śāradvatī­putra, long ago in the past, there was a royal bodhisattva prince called Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma
Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma wrote down and embraced everything that was well said, and he would recite these teachings to the point of memorizing them all
At that time, moreover, in his efforts to pursue the Dharma, Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma would make every effort, searching for the Dharma from village to village, town to town, city to city, and country to country
Once there was a man sitting on a mountain slope who said to the bodhisattva Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma, ‘Prince, come here
I will give you a sermon about the qualities of a thus-gone one.
“Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma then approached the man sitting on the mountain slope and said
‘Please give me that sermon about the qualities of a thus-gone one!
he responded
“ ‘Prince,’ ‘as that teaching is priceless, I will not teach it!
“Śāradvatī­putra, the prince then donned a precious garment worth two hundred million and fastened to himself a precious gem worth four hundred million
The greedy man, overcome by desire, then thought
‘Now, if only the prince were to give me that garment and that precious gem, then I would teach him the verse.
“Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma said to the man
‘Listen, tell me what you desire and you shall have it
Teach me the verse about the Buddha!
“So the man replied
‘Prince, if you first give me the garment and the precious gem that you are wearing and then toss yourself off this slope, then I will teach you the verse.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma then said to the man
‘If it is of benefit to you, then I shall throw myself off this mountain slope.
“He responded
‘Prince, that will of course not do me any good at all
However, if you give me that garment and that precious gem and then hear the verse, you might later have regret and forcefully take them back.
the bodhisattva Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma implored the man
“ ‘Sir, please teach me the verse!
‘I will not regret having given those things to you.
said the man,
“ ‘Prince,’ it is precisely when you are not keeping your promise that you are going to regret it.
“So the bodhisattva great being Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma said
‘Alright, if you think so, then I will fulfill your demand
Teach me the verse about the Buddha! I will then give you the precious garment and the precious gem
Once I have heard the verse, I will then throw myself off this mountain slope.
“Śāradvatī­putra, the man then taught to the bodhisattva the verse about the qualities of the Buddha
Śāradvatī­putra, as soon as he heard it, Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma gave the man the garment and the precious gem, and invoked the power of the truth, saying, ‘By the truth and the true words that I have given that precious garment and precious gem with neither regret nor anguish, may I come to rest on the ground unhurt and uninjured.
Once he had thus invoked the power of the truth
he threw himself off the slope
As soon as he had thrown himself, the four kings took hold of him and promptly placed him safely on the ground
Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma then said to the man
‘Sir, those well-spoken words, with such sublime meaning and phrasing, were amazing!
“Śāradvatī­putra, the man quickly descended from the slope, approached Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma and said
‘Prince, it is amazing how impetuously you have acted
Prince, what do you want the Dharma for?
“He replied
‘I will ferry across beings that are wallowing, free beings that are in bondage, and deliver from suffering beings that are stuck in suffering!
“Śāradvatī­putra, with complete trust in the bodhisattva’s words, the man was pleased and said to the bodhisattva Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma
‘Prince, I will therefore return to you the precious garment and the precious gem
This is because, Prince, the garment and precious gem suit you.
he replied
“ ‘Sir,’ ‘it is not my lot to take back what I have once given.
exclaimed the man
“ ‘Prince, you shall therefore be my refuge!
“Śāradvitīputra, if you have any doubt or hesitation, thinking that the bodhisattva Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma from that time was someone else
do not see it like that, Śāradvatī­putra
For, Śāradvatī­putra, at that time it was I who was the bodhisattva called Dharma­paryeṣaṇakāma
Śāradvatī­putra, if you think that the man who appeared then was someone else
do not see it like that
For, Śāradvatī­putra, the man who acquired devotion through me and said, ‘You shall be my refuge,’ was Vakkalin
Śāradvatī­putra, as for the monk Vakkalin, these days too, while I was traveling with my assembly of monks through the sky, I alighted on a mountain slope
I called out, ‘Come here, Vakkalin!’ and he engendered the liberation of absorption. Thereupon
he tossed himself off the mountain slope and
while thus suspended in the sky, he actualized the six superknowledges
Śāradvatī­putra, look at how long that heap of merit followed him! Look at how I acted as his refuge—how through the ripening of the root of virtue and the karma from having taught me a single four-line verse he acquired devotion through me and by believing in me, so swiftly attained liberation
Look, Śāradvatī­putra, at how that person’s previous attitude of desire led him to form such roots of virtue, and consider all that happened as the entire range of consequences therefrom
What need is there then to speak of someone who, having engendered the liberation of absorption and analyzed carefully, fathoms the wisdom of awakening and then encourages bodhisattva great beings, inspires them to uphold the Dharma, uplifts them, or even teaches them as little as just a four-line verse
Śāradvatī­putra, I would not say that such a heap of merit would be exhausted or come to an end in the interim, except for at great nirvāṇa.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what would happen if some noble son or daughter, who had engendered such a heap of merit from pleasing a bodhisattva with a discourse about the Dharma, and from encouraging them by inspiring them to uphold it, were then to discourage, distract, or interfere with a bodhisattva great being who possesses the mind of awakening and who wishes to enter the city of buddha qualities
Please teach on this situation
Why am I asking this
I ask so that those who have set out to interfere with bodhisattvas may hear it and disclose their wrongdoing as such, and for all those who will set out, or are setting out to do such things, to hear this and receive censure from the Blessed One.
The Blessed One said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, whoever sets out to interfere with, discourage, or distract a bodhisattva, such interference will incur a heap of faults
Śāradvatī­putra, it is as follows: just as anything that obstructs a very precious, priceless gem obstructs a great amount of wealth
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, anyone who obstructs a single instance of a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening obstructs innumerable, immeasurably many hundreds of thousands of teachings of the precious Dharma
“Śāradvatī­putra, along the same lines, just as anyone who interferes with and sets out to bring to ruin the growth of a medicinal tree, Śāradvatī­putra, interferes with immeasurably many beings afflicted with illness, such that they prevent those beings from being free of severe illness and bring about their demise
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, whoever interferes with the medicine of engendering the mind of awakening, the peerless intention, the intention of welfare and happiness, and the intention to remove all the illnesses of afflictions from beings, Śāradvatī­putra, interferes with providing great relief, pacification, health, and comfort to immeasurable, innumerable beings who are afflicted with the diseases of desire, anger, and delusion, and infected with the severe illnesses of jealousy, miserliness, rage, guile, deception, argumentativeness, shamelessness, pretense, malice, conceit, heedlessness, pride, and vanity
“Śāradvatī­putra, in the same vein, just as one should understand that whoever sets out to interfere with the abode of Anavatapta and the great nāga king himself, has set out to interfere with the waters replete with eight qualities, which quench the torment of thirst of many humans and quadrupeds
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that anyone who interferes with a bodhisattva’s engendering of the altruistic intention of awakening, Śāradvatī­putra, interferes with the stream of Dharma replete with eight qualities, which eliminates all the cravings of immeasurable, countless beings
“Śāradvatī­putra, in the same vein, just as one should understand that any being who sets out to interfere with the orb of the sun, Śāradvatī­putra, sets out to eclipse the great illumination for all beings present throughout the four continents
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that anyone who interferes with the presence of the light of Dharma, that is, engendering the mind of awakening, discouraging it and preventing it from being communicated, Śāradvatī­putra, interferes with the great illumination and great brilliance of the Dharma for all beings present throughout the trichiliocosm
“Śāradvatī­putra, in the same vein, just as one should understand that when certain people lay waste to the source of all gems, they are ruining the chance for immeasurable, innumerable beings to discover gems
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that those who set out to bring an end to a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind set on the wisdom of awakening, the great engendering of the mind of awakening, Śāradvatī­putra, have set out to lay waste to the riches of the supreme gems of the Dharma for immeasurable, innumerable beings
“Śāradvatī­putra, in the same vein, just as all those gems emerge from the same source
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, all the gem-like dharmas of the buddhas emerge from a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening, the source of all such gems
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that those who set out to bring an end to a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening incur a great heap of faults
Śāradvatī­putra, along these lines, for example, anyone who interferes with bodhisattvas, discouraging them from the mind of awakening, is identical to someone nowadays who would maliciously engender the intention to draw my blood
Or, Śāradvatī­putra, setting aside engendering the intention to draw my blood
those noble sons and daughters engender a much larger heap of faults than even committing all five sins of immediate retribution, which I have explained as so difficult to endure, atone for, and recover from
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, committing the five sins of immediate retribution does not make obstacles for any qualities of the buddhas whatsoever, yet laying waste to a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening lays waste to all awakened qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, just as to kill a cow prevents the presence of milk
likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, to discourage and lay waste to the mind of awakening lays waste to all awakened qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that laying waste to the mind of awakening is far more insidious than all five sins of immediate retribution
“Śāradvatī­putra, forget about the five sins of immediate retribution
Śāradvatī­putra, imagine that the entire universe with its four great continents was filled with worthy ones, and someone were to kill that entire assembly of worthy ones
What do you think, Śāradvatī­putra, would that person incur great faults based on that?
replied Śāradvatī­putra
“Blessed One, it would be a lot,
“Blessed One, that person would incur a tremendous heap of faults.
said the Blessed One
“Śāradvatī­putra,” “you should believe this. You should comprehend this
Śāradvatī­putra, a person could kill that entire assembly of worthy ones. However
someone else might cause a bodhisattva great being, who travels by means of the vehicle to omniscience and wants to enter the city of Dharma of a perfect buddha, to lose interest in the mind of awakening
If that bodhisattva, due to being discouraged from the mind of awakening, were to subsequently discard the mind of awakening, then
Śāradvatī­putra, the former heap of faults would not approach even a hundredth of the heap of faults of the latter—no comparison would ever suffice
destroying that entire assembly of worthy ones would not diminish the ten powers of a thus-gone one
It would not diminish the four fearlessnesses of a thus-gone one
It would not diminish the eighteen unique attributes of a buddha
It would not diminish his great love
It would not diminish his great compassion
It would not diminish the elephant-like gaze of a thus-gone one
It would not diminish the lion-like gait of a thus-gone one
It would not diminish his imperceptible crown protuberance
It would not diminish being replete with millions of conch shells of Dharma
It would not diminish his unexcelled turning of the wheel of Dharma
It would not diminish a thus-gone one from being the best among humans
It would not diminish his knowledge of the superior and lesser faculties of beings
That is because It would not diminish his knowledge of the variety of inclinations. Yet, Śāradvatī­putra, discouraging a bodhisattva diminishes all those qualities
“Śāradvatī­putra, forget about the world systems with four continents
Śāradvatī­putra, along similar lines, as an analogy
suppose this trichiliocosm were filled with worthy ones, and someone were to kill all those worthy ones—Śāradvatī­putra, I say that the heap of faults caused by discouraging a bodhisattva from the mind of awakening would far exceed the heap of merit caused by killing all those worthy ones
That is because, Śāradvatī­putra, preventing someone from engendering the mind of awakening destroys all awakened qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, if the mind of awakening had not been engendered, the wisdom of awakening would not have currently appeared
Śāradvatī­putra, if the mind of awakening had not been engendered, then such a buddha, the best among men, would not have currently appeared in the world
And it is because, Śāradvatī­putra, if the mind of awakening had not been engendered, then the blessed buddhas would not have currently appeared
said Śāradvatī­putra
“Indeed, Blessed One,
The Blessed One continued
“Śāradvatī­putra, that is why any noble son, noble daughter, monk, nun, layman, laywoman, god, nāga, yakṣa, gandharva, demigod, garuḍa, kiṃnara, or mahoraga, who has the mind of awakening, is worthy of veneration by the world with its gods
And why is that
Because, Śāradvatī­putra, it should be understood that those who have engendered that exalted intention eventually will become thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas
“Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think
When the Thus-Gone One teaches the bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening
does the Thus-Gone One teach on such matters especially to those of the warrior caste who are like a great sāla tree; or to those of the brahmin caste who are like a great sāla tree; or to those of the householder caste who are like a great sāla tree; or to universal monarchs; or to gods of the realm of the four great kings; or to the four great kings; or to Śakra, lord of the gods; or to the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three; or, likewise, to the gods of the heavens of Free from Strife, Joyous , Delighting in Emanations or Making Use of Others’ Emanations; or all the way up to the gods of the Unexcelled Heaven?
replied Śāradvatī­putra
“Not so, Blessed One,
“That is because the Blessed One teaches only the pure engendering of the mind of awakening, and only the great engendering of the altruistic intention.
asked the Blessed One
“Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think?
“When teaching the engendering of the mind of awakening
does the Blessed One especially teach it to those with great power, such as teaching it to those with the power of a dignitary, the power of a great dignitary, or half the power of Nārāyāṇa, or does he especially teach it to those who are humble, poor, or lofty?
said Śāradvatī­putra
“Not so, Blessed One,
the Blessed One continued
“Śāradvatī­putra,” “it is for this reason that if you see that mind of awakening engendered in anyone, whether they be powerful or weak, humble or lofty
you should protect that engendered intention
Śāradvatī­putra, you should inspire that bodhisattva to uphold it. You should please that bodhisattva. You should encourage that bodhisattva
Śāradvatī­putra, whatever is done to encourage bodhisattvas by inspiring them to uphold the intention and so delighting them is the supreme veneration for hearers
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that hearers who wish to venerate me should by all means compel and encourage bodhisattvas to take up bodhisattva conduct
Śāradvatī­putra, I fully entrust to the hearers the task of ensuring, by all means, that bodhisattva great beings develop and do not decline.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, engendering the mind of awakening has the following three elements
The initial engendering of the mind of awakening, the irreversible engendering of the mind of awakening, and the accomplished engendering of the mind of awakening. That being the case
about which of these engenderings of the mind of awakening has the Blessed One taught in particular regarding its qualities?
the Blessed One answered
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is exactly as you have said,
“Engendering the mind of awakening has the following three elements: the initial engendering of the mind of awakening, the irreversible engendering of the mind of awakening, and the accomplished engendering of the mind of awakening
Śāradvatī­putra, among them, it is the initial engendering of the mind of awakening that bodhisattvas might turn away from and thus fall into the vehicle of the hearers or the vehicle of the solitary buddhas
In such a case, Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One makes them take delight in engendering of the mind of awakening, inspires them to uphold it, and encourages them to engender it
This is because he thinks, ‘May bodhisattvas by all means abide in unexcelled and perfect awakening! May they turn away from the intentions of the hearers and solitary buddhas and not base themselves on those two vehicles! May they, by not basing themselves on them, be firm in the awakened qualities and arrive at the object of awakening!
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should apply themselves to accomplishing the birth of the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening
“Śāradvatī­putra, one should view the mind as emptiness
Śāradvatī­putra, what is the emptiness of mind
How should one view the mind as emptiness
Śāradvatī­putra, mind is mind, mental cognition, consciousness, mental body, mental faculty, and mental constituent
these are mind
What is its emptiness
Śāradvatī­putra, mind is empty of mind, fo
it has no creator whatsoever
If it had some creator, then because of that there would be something else that would have experience
Neither does mind itself form mind
If mind formed mind, then just that would be the creator and experiencer
If another mind formed mind, then it would belong to that which created it, bu
even having created it, the other would have experience
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that mind is empty of mind, fo
it has no creator whatsoever
That which lacks a creator has not created so much as an iota
In that which has not created so much as an iota no creation can be perceived
That in which no creation can be perceived lacks a point of objection
Those who object to it object to nonexistence
Those who object to nonexistence object to emptiness
They object to signlessness and wishlessness
Those who object to emptiness object to hollowness and futility
Those who object to hollowness and futility argue with the Thus-Gone One
Those who argue with the Thus-Gone One fall off a steep cliff
And what is the steep cliff, Śāradvatī­putra
It is the hells, the animal realm, and the world of Yama
The true steep cliff is as follows: belief in perception, belief in the aggregates, belief in the elements, belief in the sense sources, belief in a life force, belief in emergence, belief in disintegration, belief in sentient beings, and belief in persons
Śāradvatī­putra, in short, even belief in nirvāṇa is a perception, as are belief in the Buddha, belief in the Dharma, and belief in the Saṅgha
Immature, ordinary beings attached to those beliefs will fall off a steep cliff
This steep cliff is none other than saṃsāra.
This concludes the eighth chapter
Then, a beggar called Vijayarakṣa came into the assembly and sat down
Having risen from his seat, he draped his robe over one shoulder, bowed to the Blessed One with palms joined, and said
“Blessed One, I do not want to fall off such a cliff, nor argue with the Thus-Gone One, bu
I do want to awaken to unexcelled and perfect awakening
So I am wondering, Blessed One
how can I, a poor and destitute person, fully awaken to buddhahood when I live off the wealth of others, gaining the luxury of a home through negative conduct and hardship
Perfectly accomplishing awakening is for great, sāla tree-like warriors, brahmins, and householders.
The Blessed One said
“I do not especially teach to the warrior caste who are like a great sāla tree, or to those of the brahmin caste who are like a great sāla tree, or to those of the householder caste who are like a great sāla tree. Nor do I especially teach to nobles, to the wealthy, or to gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, or mahoragas. Rather
whoever gives rise to the mind of awakening is worthy of veneration by the world with its gods.
said Vijayarakṣa 
“Blessed One,” “from this time forth I give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening.
The Blessed One replied to the beggar Vijayarakṣa 
“ Vijayarakṣa , you are following the example of the thus-gone ones. Excellent! Excellent!
The beggar Vijayarakṣa then spoke to the Blessed One the following verses
“I do not look for praise
I do not seek to be respected by merchants
I want sublime wisdom, The unexcelled wisdom of awakening
“You are unexcelled in the world
You are ever supreme in the world
You are the sole protector and refuge of beings Who are tormented by suffering
“Endowed with superior vision, You have actualized the stainless Dharma, Saving beings from saṃsāra
And you teach the Dharma for their benefit
“Your supernatural power is infinite, An
your radiance, too, is infinite
Your insight is supreme, Fo
you are exalted in all qualities
“I made the aspiration, ‘May I become like this!
Yet I became discouraged, Wondering who would give that to a pauper
“There are kings, householders, brahmins, Gods, kiṃnaras— Beings with supernatural powers and great brilliance
Yet this is the foremost person among them
“How would anyone confer awakening, To which the world has no access, To paupers that survive Off the wealth of others
“Knowing my mind, You said to Śāriputra
‘I have taught engendering the mind of awakening
I have not taught it exclusively to those of the warrior caste
“ ‘Nor is it only for brahmins, merchants, or commoners
I have not taught it exclusively to the low, the lofty, gods, Or nāgas, yakṣas, or kiṃnaras
Rather, I have taught it to those of pure intention.
“Hearing such teaching from the Thus-Gone One
I was filled with strength, and spoke these words
‘May I become a supreme savior of the earth
Now that the mind set on awakening is born in me.
“The sky might fall, the earth might decay
Likewise, Sumeru, the king of mountains, might decay An
the element of space might change. Ye
it is impossible for my intention to waver
“Even if all beings were to become māras, And create obstacles for me In order to thwart this intention
I would not relinquish it
“If there were some beings here And if they were to say before me
‘This sublime wisdom of awakening is so precious
Who would give awakening to a pauper?
“Then I would reply
‘You are poorer than I; I am not a pauper
You have never had faith
Since I do have faith, I will awaken.
“Awakening has no caste whatsoever
Neither does it have any fruition, nor life force
Rather, whoever bows to the mind of awakening Bows to this unexcelled vehicle
“This mind of the supreme sage is the caste
This is the seed; this, the fruition
Having embarked upon the sacred and supreme vehicle
One is trained by the buddhas and becomes awakened
“I have utterly abandoned my body, my life force, And any indulgence in worldly play
Instead, I am intent on the wisdom of awakening. Having fully awakened, I will free beings
“To the Buddha, the Lord of Dharma, seated before me I have proclaimed this here with a lion’s roar
If I happen to be at all mistaken
Will the Victorious One, out of love, let me know?
The Blessed One then responded to the beggar Vijayarakṣa in verse
“In this the Buddha is utterly unmistaken
This intention is unsurpassed
Today you have abandoned that previous idea, S
you too will become a victorious one, a lord of Dharma.
Having heard the Thus-Gone One’s words
He was ecstatic beyond measure
Vijayarakṣa had faith in them And ascended in the sky to a height of seven palm trees
At that moment the best among beings showed a smile
Multiple exquisite blue and yellow colored lights Issued forth from the Victorious One’s mouth And dissolved into his own crown
Then, with his robe draped over one shoulder and his palms joined
Ānanda asked the best among humans
“Lord, what was the cause of this? Blissful One, what were its conditions
I ask this of the Victorious One, he with unobstructed wisdom
“Lord, Vijayarakṣa , looking so oppressed, Appeared in the house of the Lord as a beggar
Today, suspended in the sky at a height of seven palm trees
He pays homage to the Victorious One
“Gods, nāgas, mahoragas, Yakṣas, nonhuman kiṃnaras, And humans join their palms toward him, And, Lord, pay homage to Vijayarakṣa
“I ask the Lord of the World the reason for this
For whom did the sage show his smile
For whom was that explanation On those that have embarked toward highest awakening
“Who abides in the wisdom of awakening
For whom is that unexcelled intention present
Who will reach the most sublime wisdom And deliver beings from saṃsāra
“Who will then be present on the seat of awakening, Vanquish Māra and his hordes, And, having vanquished Māra and his hordes, abandon afflictions And turn the sublime wheel of peace
“Who will possess the peerless wisdom
Who will become of vast benefit And then continue to turn the wheel further, So that wisdom becomes everywhere unimpeded, “And the words of the best among humans are here disclosed
Who then will possess those true words, So that beings that are doubtful of the true wisdom, Will no longer appear in these present times
“Who will possess the mind of perpetual equipoise
You who reached the peace of awakening, And know the minds of beings throughout the three times
I beg you to explain the sublime and supreme Dharma
“Whose Dharma will, when taught, Satiate the world with its gods
Who will come to vanquish delusion And gaze with an elephant’s gaze
“Who will possess the great saṅgha
Who will purify this field
Who will abandon all inopportune states, And, endowed with leisure, long for the land beyond suffering
“Mighty One, when I ask about these matters
May the Lord of the World show a smile, And
Guide of the World, explain these things to me, Fo
upon hearing them, all beings will be joyous!
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, when the smile was shown, the beggar Vijayarakṣa and likewise eighty quadrillion gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas gave rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening an
I then prophesied their unexcelled and perfect awakening.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“When I explained this aim
Those who embarked upon the supreme vehicle Totaled eighty quadrillion beings
They will all become victorious ones, supreme humans
“The beggar Vijayarakṣa , too, Paid homage while seated before me
He became elated and levitated into the sky
He, in this way, also paid homage to me
“Since he has performed this deed
He will henceforth never fall astray, But [perpetually attain leisure in each and every lifetime, And continually behold the buddhas.
[He will henceforth never fall astray, But ]perpetually attain leisure in each and every lifetime, And [continually behold the buddhas.
[He will henceforth never fall astray, But perpetually attain leisure in each and every lifetime, And] continually behold the buddhas
“Having seen the most sublime beings
He will pay homage to them as a cause of awakening
He will then pay homage with flowers, incenses, and perfumes, And with parasols and banners
“He will likewise pay homage to the victorious ones With the best of garments and alms, And with bedding, and then, with facilities
Eventually, he will practice bodhisattva conduct there
“Having pleased the loving supreme beings
He will pay homage to the victorious ones there, And offer to those with unexcelled love Seventy quadrillion gems
“Then the light from those gems will issue forth, Spreading as far as eighty leagues
The light issuing from the gems Will pervade the light of the gems
“Then for all the billion attendants He will offer that many thrones And as many pedestals, And make as many temples
“Built in all seven kinds of precious substances
Each temple will measure a mile across
Perpetually bedecking the loving ones and their hearers with adornments, He will enthusiastically make offerings to them
“He will honor the victorious ones for three months
For one hundred years he will perform The end of the rainy season retreat ritual ceremony
Then, as he goes forth, he will practice the sublime holy life
“Joyfully and respectfully, He will pay homage to the victorious ones there
Eventually, once he has practiced the conduct of awakening
He will see all the victorious ones in the good eon
“He will behold more buddhas Than there are sand grains in the river Ganges
Who, inspired by beholding the buddhas, Would not long for the wisdom of the noble ones
“Such is the inspiration from that intention On which I have presently taught just a portion
I was not then able to give any analogy Of exactly how its qualities are
“Having been in cyclic existence for as many eons As there are sand grains in the river Ganges
He will henceforth reach the supreme vehicle And become the victorious one called Garbhagaṇa
“His lifespan will be a thousand eons
The layout of his land Will be like the abode of the gods at the peak of Sumeru, And Jambudvīpa too will be like that
“The victorious one Garbhagaṇa Will then have an assembly of hearers That numbers many billions— As many as there are sand grains in the river Ganges
“Likewise, his assembly will contain as many beings As there are sand grains in the river Ganges— All worthy ones who have exhausted defilements and are free of the afflictions
Having gained mastery, they will perfect supernatural power
“Just like Śāriputra, the fount of insight, They will have the exalted wisdom to resolve questions
They will be expert in abhidharma, sūtra, and vinaya, And be supreme among hearers, just as I have prophesied. “The thus-gone one Garbhagaṇa Will then double his assembly
They will set out for supreme, sublime awakening
Just like Maitreya, who is also called Ajita
“They will also be confined by only one more birth Before they reach unexcelled awakening
Upon the occasion of their deaths
They will realize awakening in different lands
“His assembly of valiant and stable-minded heroes Will exceed even that
At that time, in the unexcelled supreme vehicle, They will be prophesied to become buddhas under Garbhagaṇa
“Even after the Thus-Gone One has passed, His Dharma way will be present for an eon
His remains will spread
Just as at my passing
“Relics will thus form From the thus-gone one Garbhagaṇa himself
The relics of that buddha will remain Precisely according to the devotion of beings
“They will rest in a stūpa called Jewel, Adorned with banners, pillars, pavilions, And stainless bells, And thus ornament Jambudvīpa
“The beings that go to that stūpa Will strew it with flowers
The flowers will turn into canopies in the sky
Such miracles as those will take place at that time
“To the people, according to their devotion for it, The body of the Buddha will smile
It will reveal itself from within the stūpa, And having shown a smile, disappear
“Whoever sees light dissolve into the crown protuberance
We will understand as prophesied for awakening
Whoever sees light enter that victorious one’s mouth
We will understand as prophesied to be a solitary buddha
“When the light enters the navel Of the guide from inside the stūpa
Those prophesied will attain nirvāṇa
I understand that such miracles as those will take place
“The blessings of that victorious one will be present for an eon
Thereafter everything will come to an end
Nothing that is part of saṃsāra has permanence
This teaching of the buddhas is impermanent and empty.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, it is amazing that the beggar Vijayarakṣa , while in a reproachable state, is in possession of the irreproachable Dharma
Blessed One, who would reproach such a being?
The Blessed One said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Indeed, Śāradvatī­putra
who would reproach such a being but an immature, ordinary being with no learning
Śāradvatī­putra, with that in mind, I made the statement: ‘Aside from a thus-gone one, a person cannot apprehend another person’s level.
Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think
was it the case, then, that previously the beggar Vijayarakṣa was worthy of veneration by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans?
replied Śāradvatī­putra
“It was not so, Blessed One,
“That is because, Blessed One, the moment when the beggar Vijayarakṣa engendered the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening, he became worthy of veneration, worship, and homage, such tha
now, Blessed One, he is worthy of veneration by the world with its gods.
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, the unobstructed wisdom of a thus-gone one is not shared with the hearers and solitary buddhas
It is because of that, Śāradvatī­putra, that my hearers, who teach the Dharma to beings who want to respectfully listen to such a teaching, should proclaim at the very beginning the actual qualities of my wisdom
That is because those beings, having by all means heard the qualities of a thus-gone one’s wisdom so proclaimed, [will focus their minds on the wisdom of the Buddha, and in that way, be continuously in accord with the way of the Buddha.
[That is because those beings, having by all means heard the qualities of a thus-gone one’s wisdom so proclaimed, ]will focus their minds on the wisdom of the Buddha, and [in that way, be continuously in accord with the way of the Buddha.
[That is because those beings, having by all means heard the qualities of a thus-gone one’s wisdom so proclaimed, will focus their minds on the wisdom of the Buddha, and ]in that way, be continuously in accord with the way of the Buddha
“Śāradvatī­putra, the beings who set out to benefit others are few
Śāradvatī­putra, very rare, extremely rare are those beings who set out to benefit others and to benefit themselves
Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, forget about those who set out to benefit others and to benefit themselves
rare, extremely rare, Śāradvatī­putra, are those who set out to benefit themselves and others
Śāradvatī­putra, even while trying to benefit themselves, immature and misapprehending beings cause themselves nothing but harm
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, I have never seen or heard of anyone who is benefited, advantaged, unharmed, and unscathed by harming, disadvantaging, hurting, and injuring others
it is impossible
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that beings who set out to benefit themselves are so rare
such beings are so extremely rare
So extremely rare too are those beings who set out to benefit themselves and to benefit others
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that when certain beings flatter and disparage
such beings have not set out to benefit themselves or to benefit others
People like them, Śāradvatī­putra, are unwholesome
Śāradvatī­putra, those fools have set out on the wrong path
They have not set out to benefit themselves or to benefit others
Such inappropriate ones incur eight types of destruction
These eight types of destruction are: the destruction of relations, the destruction of place, the destruction of enjoyments, the destruction by fire, the destruction by royal authority, the destruction of the sense fields, the destruction of the hells, and the destruction caused by the guardians of the hells
“They will also incur eight intense types of unhappiness
These eight are:  incurring the unhappiness of birth in the hells
 incurring the unhappiness of birth in the animal realm
 incurring the unhappiness of birth in the world of Yama
 incurring the unhappiness where even though one is born among humans, one assumes birth in a peripheral region,  or one is blind, deaf, one-eyed, missing a finger or hand, paralyzed on one side, or afflicted with any severe form of illness
 incurring the unhappiness where even though one is born with a fortune equal to other humans, and although one is born in a suitable place, one mingles with crooked people, disgraceful people, uncouth people, women, dependents, nirgrantha followers or proponents of other non-Buddhist groups, or someone with wrong view, who always engages in evil deeds, has impure physical, verbal, and mental actions, and who cannot be changed for the sake of the noble ones
 and incurring the unhappiness where even though one is born among humans, a thus-gone one does not appear there, or  the night before a thus-gone one does appear one dies and does not encounter his direct presence
These are the eight intense types of unhappiness that they incur
“Those who are born among hell beings have large and broad bodies, such that they will experience great torment
Those who are born among the animals, moreover, have large and broad bodies, and take huge bites, making it difficult to be nourished
Wherever one is born there, one will commit a great many evil deeds
Born there, one might be a fish, a crocodile, an otter, a porpoise, or a timi fish
Beings catch them with hooks and hold them up, and the
in order to kill them, they cut them and beat them
Even having been violated in this way, it is not enough to kill them. Rather
their bodies grow back an
although they experience many different kinds of painful sensations, they still will not die
Elsewhere in the animal realm, one might take birth as a camel, ox, donkey, chicken, or pig
If one becomes a camel or an ox
one’s nose will be pierced and one will be loaded down with cargo, struck repeatedly with sticks, and led around on journeys
Angry and dejected, one will be forced to carry cargo, without any protection whatsoever
When one becomes physically weak from being burdened by cargo, one will be shorn of life and one’s flesh will be eaten
Such animals are thus described as ‘broad-bodied, lazy, difficult to nourish, with big bites, and ineffectual.
“Śāradvatī­putra, look at the manifestation of all the myriad undesirable and unpleasant effects from performing and accumulating negative deeds
Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One would not be able to cover the maturation of non-virtuous deeds even were he to describe it for an eon or more
Śāradvatī­putra, in short, whoever sets out to interfere with a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening, Śāradvatī­putra, will neither journey to nirvāṇa, nor have the excellent leisures
This is why, Śāradvatī­putra, you have protected yourself and thus attained the excellent leisures
“Śāradvatī­putra, the following four things are protection
Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One is the protection for beings oppressed by fear
Śāradvatī­putra, the path of the noble ones is the protection for beings who have embarked on the wrong path
Śāradvatī­putra, the applications of mindfulness are the protection that ensures negative deeds are not committed
Śāradvatī­putra, the mind of awakening is the protection of abandoning all unfavorable states
Those four things, Śāradvatī­putra, are protection
“Śāradvatī­putra, the following four things are happiness
seeing the Thus-Gone One
the excellent leisures
acquiring faith in the Dharma-Vinaya taught by the Thus-Gone One, an
a proper and excellent view
Those four things, Śāradvatī­putra, are great happiness
“Śāradvatī­putra, the following four things are health
the health of the harmonization of the constituents of the great elements and humors
the health of proper reflection on the correct view
the health of acquiring faith in the Thus-Gone One’s teaching and thus acquiring all excellent kinds of happiness an
the health of being able to engender the mind set on immeasurable, countless beings attaining unexcelled and perfect awakening and thereby eradicating the afflictions
Those four things, Śāradvatī­putra, are health
“Śāradvatī­putra, the following four things are hope
the patient hoping to be healed, the starving hoping for sustenance, those in pain and oppressed by pain hoping to enjoy pleasure, and those who have embarked on the path of the great protector hoping for bliss
Those four things, Śāradvatī­putra, are hope
“Śāradvatī­putra, the following four things are strong attachments through which beings migrate to the lower realms
strong attachment to the body, strong attachment to life force, strong attachment to enjoyments, and strong attachment to objects of sensual desire
Those four, Śāradvatī­putra, are the strong attachments through which beings migrate to the lower realms
“Śāradvatī­putra, the following seven things are receptacles
the receptacle of undigested food, the receptacle of digested food, the receptacle of phlegm, the receptacle of bile, the receptacle of wind, the receptacle of view, and along the same lines, Śāradvatī­putra, the great receptacle, which is the object of sensual desire to which one is strongly attached. For
Śāradvatī­putra, the object of sensual desire to which one is strongly attached consists of phlegm, pus, lymph, urine, feces, flesh, sinew, bone, blood, and marrow.
Also at that time, the householder called Vijayarakṣa joined the assembly and took a seat
His wife, called Rūpavatī, was exquisite, beautiful, and pleasing to behold, with a fine complexion and perfect figure
The householder Vijayarakṣa , being especially attached to her, said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, please do not say that objects of sensual desire are receptacles of feces and urine
I say this because, Blessed One, my wife called Rūpavatī does not have any feces or urine.
Understanding the householder’s exalted intention
the Blessed One manifested a woman that looked exactly like the householder’s wife Rūpavatī
Seeing her, the householder thought
“Why has my wife come here?
As the apparent wife approached, he asked her
“Why have you come to this assembly?
she replied
“Householder,” “I have come to the Thus-Gone One to listen to the Dharma.
The householder Vijayarakṣa then took his wife by the hand, wrapped her in the folds of his garment, an
both the householder Vijayarakṣa and his wife Rupāvatī took their seat
The Blessed One then produced the miraculous feat of having the woman defecate in the folds of his garment
The householder Vijayarakṣa, unable to bear the stench of the feces, blocked his nose with his fingers and turned his face, looking around
To the right side of the householder Vijayarakṣa was the son of the Śākyas called Nanda, who asked the householder Vijayarakṣa 
“Householder, why are you blocking your nose and turning away?
The householder Vijayarakṣa responded to Nanda, the son of the Śākyas
“Venerable, there is the stench of feces in this place
Do you not notice it too, just around here?
The Blessed One then performed a miraculous feat, which caused the son of the Śākyas Nanda and the fourfold retinue to clearly notice that the wife Rūpavatī had excreted feces in the folds of the garment
The son of the Śākyas Nanda then exclaimed to the householder Vijayarakṣa 
“Look, householder! Your very own wife has defecated in the folds of your garment.
The householder Vijayarakṣa then turned to the son of the Śākyas called Vanadatta and said
“Vanadatta, I would look to see if my wife had excreted or urinated if I had some doubt about it. Bu
how can I look when such a thing is impossible
Venerable one, this makes me think that perhaps you are the one who came carrying feces!
At that the son of the Śākyas became so enraged tha
he rose from his seat and shouted at the householder Vijayarakṣa 
“Householder, you are so attached tha
I will start calling you ‘Householder Feces’
Householder, did you not take your wife by her hand and wrap her in the folds of your own garment
Householder, was it not precisely that which created the present circumstance
See the source of the stench with your own eyes
Householder, since you are so attached and impertinent
I will give you the name ‘Householder Feces.
As you sit there in feces, insulting others, you are no longer Vijayarakṣa 
Householder, leave this retinue! Go away, householder
Vanish from this retinue, householder
Completely vanish, householder!
The householder then took his wife by the hands and demanded of her
“Conniving woman, how could you even get the idea to defecate in the folds of my garment?
she replied
“Householder,” “such things happen when one takes a receptacle of feces and wraps it into the folds of one’s own garment.
Dejected, the householder Vijayarakṣa considered tossing the feces to the ground, but he could not
Instead he proceeded to smear it all over his body, and then said to the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta
“Venerable, tell me, what is the best way now to be completely free of the stench of this feces?
said Vanadatta
“Householder, you will indeed be completely free of this and other things,” “However
it would be most appropriate now for you to leave this place
This is because, householder, you will die from the stench of feces that accompanies your wife.
The householder Vijayarakṣa said to the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta
“Venerable, mendicants are known as ‘compassionate.
Mendicants are known as ‘loving.
So, being a ‘son of the Śākyas,’ I wonder how much of a special being you are.
The son of the Śākyas Vanadatta replied to the householder Vijayarakṣa 
“Why should I be compassionate toward you? And why should I be loving toward you
When the Thus-Gone One was teaching the Dharma
you disagreed with him, and said, ‘My wife has neither feces nor urine.’ And thereafter you insulted me too, did you not
Householder, you need to look with your own eyes to see whether or not your wife has feces or urine.
The householder Vijayarakṣa then snapped at his wife
“Wife, you should go home!
Having sent his wife away, Vijayarakṣa said to the Śākya youth Vanadatta
“Venerable, I see the faults of women. I see the untrustworthiness of women
Vanadatta, I wish to go forth from home to homelessness.
The son of the Śākyas Vanadatta then said to the householder Vijayarakṣa 
“Householder, fumigate and soak your body with all kinds of fragrances for one hundred years
If you do that you will later succeed in going forth under the Blessed One
This is because, householder, your body has become foul-smelling from the stench of feces.
The householder Vijayarakṣa then said to the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta
“Venerable, whether I fumigate myself for one year or a hundred years, who knows if, while occupied with precisely that, I will die, or the Blessed One will pass away
On the other hand, venerable, if I do receive ordination from the Blessed One
I will not enter villages, towns, countries, or royal palaces. I will instead frequent the wilderness, beg for alms, and wear poor quality religious robes
Therefore, who will smell the foul stench of a forest-dwelling miscreant like me?
The Blessed One then said to the householder
“Householder, do you wish to go forth from home to homelessness?
he replied
“I do wish to, Blessed One,
The Blessed One said
“Monk, come join me, and live the holy life!
Once the householder, just at these words, had gone forth
he was dressed in ochre robes and his head was shaven as if seven days had passed, an
he had an alms bowl in the palms of his hands
The Blessed One then taught him the Dharma, teaching the noble truth of suffering, and, likewise, the noble truths of its origin, its cessation, and the path
Right away the monk gained the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena
He had acquired the vocation, s
the next morning he set out for the city of Rājagṛha wearing religious robes and carrying an alms bowl
While moving in rounds throughout the city of Rājagṛha for alms, he reached his own home and sat silently to one side for alms
His wife Rūpavatī saw that it was him, the householder Vijayarakṣa , who had taken ordination and come for alms wearing religious robes and carrying an alms bowl
She said
“Householder, you have acted inappropriately.
replied the monk Vijayarakṣa
“Do you understand that you excreted and urinated in the folds of my garment and thus left my entire body with a foul stench?
she said
“Householder,” “this thing that you are criticizing me for did not happen to you
Householder, I was forced by my father to follow him between our homes, and [do not recall even showing my face outside of any door, let alone going to see the Blessed One at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana.”
[Householder, I was forced by my father to follow him between our homes, and ]do not recall even showing my face outside of any door, [let alone going to see the Blessed One at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana.”
[Householder, I was forced by my father to follow him between our homes, and do not recall even showing my face outside of any door, ]let alone going to see the Blessed One at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana.
said Vijayarakṣa 
“I have as witnesses the Blessed One, the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta, and the fourfold assembly,
“Do you not recall that you and I were apprehended by the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta and exiled from the assembly?
Then Māra, the evil one, sat down behind the householder and said
“Householder, this is not why you were exiled and caused to wander
It was due to a magical apparition
Monk, you should enjoy the five sense pleasures
Householder, you were deceived by the mendicant Gautama
He has allowed many monks to go forth and thus caused them to wander.
asked the monk Vijayarakṣa
“So, the reason I was made to smell foul was because of a magical apparition?
he replied
“Indeed,
said Vijayarakṣa 
“Then you are also a magical apparition,
“And I too am a magical apparition
And all the teachings taught by the Thus-Gone One are also like a magical apparition.
At that point the woman purified the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena
Having gained devotion and acquired conviction, she said
“Be happy, monk
Live the holy life
I will likewise go forth under the teaching of the Blessed One.
Based on precisely that true perspective regarding phenomena
the Blessed One said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four qualities that bodhisattva great beings who want to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should abandon
What are these four
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should abandon evil companions
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should abandon association with women
Bodhisattva great beings should abandon the speech of nirgranthas and the spells of materialists
And, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should abandon the degeneration of wrong view
Śāradvatī­putra, these four qualities should be abandoned by bodhisattva great beings
Śāradvatī­putra, I have never seen other qualities that create obstacles exactly as these four do
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that those who have entered the Great Vehicle should abandon these four things
Having abandoned them, whoever wishes to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should then rely upon, cultivate, and develop four other things
What are these four
Śāradvatī­putra, they should rely upon, cultivate, and develop a relationship with a spiritual friend—either a buddha, bodhisattva, or hearer—who instructs upon and teaches the Dharma discourses of the Bodhisattva Collection
Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, in order to avoid association with women, bodhisattvas should rely upon, revere, and serve those who are renounced, those who have gone forth, and those who dwell in the forest
Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, in order to avoid materialists and the speech of nirgranthas, bodhisattvas should engage in the practice of receiving, mastering, and memorizing the teachings
Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, in order to avoid wrong view, bodhisattvas should rely upon and cultivate the correct view of great emptiness.
Once the Blissful One had thus spoken
the Teacher also imparted the following instructions
“One should abandon association with women
One should also abandon evil companions
In order to avoid wrong view, One should abandon materialists
“Whoever relies upon women, Evil companions, Materialists, And wrong view, “Will, through relying upon such bad views, and the rest, Immediately migrate to unfortunate states, And find it exceedingly difficult to acquire The leisures and excellent faith in the Buddha
“Whoever wants to rely on the evil Will become absorbed in evil
Those who partake of evil experience Will migrate to evil destinies
“Whoever has set out for awakening Should not rely upon women
One should keep them at bay, As one would a pig smeared with filth
“One should not rely on evil friends Who teach what is at odds with Dharma
By relying on conduct at odds with Dharm
One will be shrouded in unconscious oblivion
“One should not rely on materialists And what is held by nirgranthas
They may teach ever so gently, You will end up acquiring their perspective
“Once you have abandoned all those
You should abandon wrong view
I have taught here That this is the root of saṃsāra
“If you abandon negative qualities, And practice the conduct of a bodhisattva
You will fully course in the supreme qualities That were taught by me previously
“What connects you with that path Are the act of going forth, pure conduct, A sublime spiritual friend, Buddhas, and hearers
“Upon the path you should rely on emptiness
But within great emptiness there is no emptiness
Perceiving empty phenomena Is not to experience anything at all
“Phenomena and, likewise, perception Will not bring about the perception of emptiness
Emptiness is taught to be That to which the world has no access
“If those whom I have previously trained Practice the conduct of a bodhisattva, They cannot be matched By those of immature intellect, no matter how much they may know
“Whoever receives my Dharma, And practices as a bodhisattva based on it, Will not fall under the influence of others When practicing bodhisattva conduct
“I teach the sublime Dharma, Having realized those matters myself
That which is unobstructed regarding emptiness Is the true path
“What I realized beyond conception While seated at the seat of awakening, After overcoming the malicious Māra, Is said to be reality
“I truly realized that, And that is precisely what I have taught
Because the wheel was turned, I awakened to the supreme limit
“Whoever wants to destroy the malicious Māra, Awaken to buddhahood, And sit at the seat of awakening Must rely on emptiness
“Whoever wants to turn The wheel of the unexcelled Dharma, And instruct the saṅgha in it, Must rely on emptiness
“Whoever wants to be transformed By the ten powers And then fearlessly resound the lion’s roar Must rely on emptiness
“It was by relying continually on emptiness, Whose renown and fame Is widespread throughout all worlds, That I reached the other shore
“Following my example, The supremely wise bodhisattva Should awaken to the sublime awakening Of unexcelled wisdom
“Whoever follows my example, Whether it be a monk or a nun, Will attain sublime awakening Just as I have attained it now
“This is not to be relied upon By monks and nuns alone
Any being that trains in it Will easily discover awakening
“When relying on this sublime trut
I became free of attachment
Through the unshared qualities I awakened to the awakening of non-attachment
“When relying on those teachings
Unhindered wisdom will not be meager
That is the path toward awakening
You should continually rely on emptiness
“Thus, to benefit beings, A bodhisattva should train In the teachings that show All phenomena to be empty.
This concludes the ninth chapter
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four qualities that bodhisattva great beings can possess to make them expert in resolving the nature of things as they are
They also give them an eloquence that is unobstructed, acute, limitless, and profound with respect to all dharmas
At that point the thus-gone ones comprehend their expertise in resolving things exactly as they are, as well as their acute and felicitous eloquence, and thus authorize them to guard the city of the Dharma for posterity
“Śāradvatī­putra, what are those four qualities
Bodhisattvas take constant delight in the attitude of relying constantly on their having going forth, such tha
they apply themselves to the practice of renunciation and are never contented when pursuing the Dharma
Having heard the Dharma and pursued it, they share it liberally with all beings
They are never lazy to teach the Dharma, an
with a knowledge that all phenomena perish, they practice non-referential concentration
they also cultivate recollecting the Buddha for the sake of awakening, with the thought that the Buddha is the most exalted among all beings
They do not apprehend any marks based on the observation of a body
Śāradvatī­putra, those are the four qualities that bodhisattva great beings possess that give them unobstructed eloquence with respect to all phenomena, such tha
a thus-gone one authorizes them to guard the city of the Dharma for posterity
“Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, there are four qualities that bodhisattva great beings can possess so that they do not forget the Dharma even after parting from this life
What are these four
They should not be contented with the pursuit of Dharma and with giving the gift of Dharma; for
Śāradvatī­putra, the son or daughter of noble family with this first quality will not forget even upon parting from this life
Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas should encourage many other beings also to perfectly uphold unexcelled and perfect awakening, and thus repeatedly extol the qualities of the Thus-Gone One; for
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas with this second quality will not forget even upon parting from this life
Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas should be accepting of the profound; for
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas with this third quality will not forget even upon parting from this life
Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, in order to please the Thus-Gone One, bodhisattva great beings should not be mentally distracted and
in order to bring the Thus-Gone One’s teaching to mind, they should have introspection and mindfulness, and die with acceptance of the profound; for
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas with this fourth quality will not forget even upon parting from this life.
These were the Thus-Gone One’s words
Having so taught, the teacher continued
“They pursue the Dharma, And also give the gift of Dharma
Thus they will never, ever Forget the Dharma
“They encourage others to perfectly uphold awakening, And establish many beings there
Thus they ensure that throughout their lives Their recollection will not decline
“They rely on emptiness and the profound teachings Delivered by the Buddha
Their acceptance of the teaching of non-arising Will therefore not decline
“Even birth is non-originating, And so is anyone who has been born
Through acceptance of such teachings Their recollection will not decline
“The wise do not die With a distracted mind
They constantly observe the Buddha and his speech Within the qualities of the buddhas
“When the wise di
They have no cowardice
Thus, throughout their lifetimes Their recollection will not decline
“If those who want supreme wisdom Pursue awakening— Exalted, sublime awakening
They rely on four qualities
“Continually praised by the buddhas
Those four qualities are supreme and paramount
Since I have thus taught them to you, Rely on those qualities
“As they have also helped me, I teach them to help you
Accepting their help for perfect awakening
One will go utterly unpunished
“Since it is the resolve for awakening That elicits desire for wisdom, You should thus rely on the path
Awakening is attained based on it
“Those with an attitude of laziness And an attitude of cowardice Will not be able to reach supreme awakening
Thus, they should be abandoned
“Those who believe in self, Believe in beings, And believe in objects Are unable to awaken to buddhahood
“Having thus abandoned those
Rely continually on emptiness
By destroying all objects within that, Pristine wisdom will emerge
“You should not settle, But move from your place
Delight in the pure movement Beyond coming and going
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four qualities that those who have entered the Great Vehicle will accomplish above all. These four are as follows
Śāradvatī­putra, when the awakening of buddhas is in decline and the sublime Dharma is disappearing, bodhisattvas will make efforts to pursue the sublime Dharma
When thus-gone ones’ memorials are delapidated
bodhisattvas will restore them and
even as they discard their bodies and lives
they will not discard the Dharma
When seeing beings suffering, it evokes compassion
To have developed compassion causes them to strengthen their efforts further, thus eliciting the thought, ‘Once I have accomplished the wisdom of awakening, I will teach the Dharma to quell all the suffering of those beings.
“Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are not content when pursuing the Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings have a greater inspiration to pursue the Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, because of their grasp of the Great Vehicle, bodhisattva great beings are unparalleled
Śāradvatī­putra, because of their wish to benefit beings, bodhisattva great beings lovingly think, ‘They have no other protector at all, so it all comes down to me alone.
Śāradvatī­putra, since they have the attitude of adhering to great compassion, bodhisattva great beings have no anger
Śāradvatī­putra, because of their accomplishment of wisdom on behalf of all beings, bodhisattvas have no jealousy
Śāradvatī­putra, because of benefiting all beings through the gift of Dharma, bodhisattvas have no miserliness
Śāradvatī­putra, to demonstrate their altruism, bodhisattvas give away all their possessions
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas have no clinging to any phenomenon
“Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas smile without anger, saying, ‘Come here! You are welcome!
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas have no agitation, an
when seeing beings suffering, they act compassionately and consistently exert effort
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas delight in the qualities of the buddhas
Śāradvatī­putra, since they proclaim the lion’s roar, bodhisattvas are not afraid
Śāradvatī­putra, since they are grounded in the qualities of the buddhas, bodhisattva great beings are not timid
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas make efforts to pursue the qualities of the buddhas
Śāradvatī­putra, to constantly make effort and teach the Dharma, bodhisattvas course throughout the trichiliocosm
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattvas have come to an understanding of all phenomena, they are guardians of the victorious
Śāradvatī­putra, due to their discernment of all phenomena, exactly as they are, bodhisattvas uphold their essence
Śāradvatī­putra, since they understand all phenomena, bodhisattvas on their own have extracted their essence
Śāradvatī­putra, out of their ability to mature beings in timely and untimely ways, bodhisattvas provide encouragement
Śāradvatī­putra, since they are in harmony with the Dharma, bodhisattvas defeat those who argue against them
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings ascertain the meaning of all phenomena
“Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are of the caste of the qualities of the buddhas
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are the great treasure of the great jewel of the Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the ocean of the Dharma, which opens out into the realization of the seal of all phenomena
Śāradvatī­putra, because they avert immeasurable, innumerable disturbances, bodhisattva great beings are like the Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa mountain ranges
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings perfectly teach the Dharma without end, they are never finished
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings have minds equal to the sky, they are stainless
Śāradvatī­putra, just as the sky is inexhaustible, bodhisattva great beings do not know exhaustion
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are exalted in terms of virtuous qualities, they are like a mountain
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are free of wanting and not wanting, they are like the earth
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings do not squander roots of virtue, they are like a field
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings fully reveal the light of Dharma, they are like the sun
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings dispel darkness, they are like the moon
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings quell the torment of desire, anger, and delusion, they are like a parasol
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are the shelter, refuge, and teacher of beings, they are like the shade of a large tree
Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are adept in all the fields of artistry, they are like a teacher
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings derive their sustenance from fulfilling the intentions of all beings
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the teachers of all beings
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the support of all beings
Śāradvatī­putra, imagine if all beings knew, as I do, how bodhisattvas abide by such actions on their behalf
Śāradvatī­putra, suppose that all beings then were to give bodhisattvas all their happiness, love, and joy, while carrying the bodhisattvas on their shoulders or heads from the time when bodhisattvas first give rise to the mind of awakening up until when they sit down at the seat of awakening
And suppose that once bodhisattvas reach the seat of awakening, all beings were to lay out a single carpet of precious fabric extending from the earth to the peak of existence, and with the thought, ‘How terrible if the bodhisattva’s body were to get too hot,’ they were also to have parasols of divine materials held up all around covering them
Suppose, moreover, that all beings were also to worship, revere, and honor them with flowers, incense, garlands, and unguents
Śāradvatī­putra, even respecting, honoring, and worshiping the bodhisattva great beings by performing such actions on their behalf would not be able to repay them
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, these pleasures do not approach even one hundredth of the assistance provided by bodhisattvas as they furnish all beings with the pleasure of freedom from torment—no comparison whatsoever would suffice
[This is because, ]Śāradvatī­putra, everything provided by beings is impermanent, mundane, associated with the aggregates, defiled, and mutable; whereas, [Śāradvatī­putra, the happiness provided by bodhisattvas is undefiled, supramundane, trustworthy, devoid of intrinsic nature, and emptiness.
This is because, [Śāradvatī­putra, everything provided by beings is impermanent, mundane, associated with the aggregates, defiled, and mutable; whereas, ]Śāradvatī­putra, the happiness provided by bodhisattvas is undefiled, supramundane, trustworthy, devoid of intrinsic nature, and emptiness
Śāradvatī­putra, this is why beings cannot benefit bodhisattvas with any of the pleasures in their possession
They are the circumspect for careless beings
They are the sane for insane beings
Śāradvatī­putra, they are the eyes for blind beings
They are their guides
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the medicine for beings afflicted with disease
They show the way to those who have embarked on the wrong path
They show the correct way to those who have strayed
Bodhisattvas inspire those who have not engendered roots of virtue to do so
Śāradvatī­putra, this is because bodhisattvas are those who awaken all slumbering beings. Bodhisattvas inspire those who have not engendered wholesome qualities to do so
Thus, Śāradvatī­putra, in short, beings have no protection, refuge, or savior except for thus-gone ones and bodhisattvas, for
Śāradvatī­putra, the Buddha too has emerged from bodhisattvas.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, the vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is indeed so wonderful. Moreover, it is amazing how much it beautifies themselves as well as others
Blessed One, to give a simile, it is like a pāriyātra tree whose branches are all covered with flowers in full bloom beautifying itself and others too
Likewise, Blessed One, bodhisattvas fully replete with the qualities of the buddhas beautify themselves and immeasurably many beings
To give another simile, Blessed One, it is like the pāriyātra tree causing the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to dance, play, and frolic
Likewise, Blessed One, bodhisattva great beings, once they fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, are replete with the qualities of the buddhas. In this way
while beautifying themselves, they also cause immeasurable, innumerable beings to journey there too
Beings who have reached there, moreover, also play, frolic, and take pleasure in the masteries, powers, branches of awakening, concentrations, liberations , absorptions, and attainments. This being the case
Blessed One, who, except for lazy ones like us that fall under the sway of others, would not adhere to that vehicle? Who would not long for it
Blessed One, we are encouraged and pleased to be given and taught another teaching. For otherwise
Blessed One, in the future we would lack the power by which we could at some point impact any being based on what we have heard from the Blessed One
Blessed One, if we were henceforth to teach anyone
we would start with the Bodhisattva Vehicle at the very beginning and later teach the Hearer Vehicle
This is because, Blessed One, if we were to establish any being in awakening by encouraging them to swiftly awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, we would be returning the favor that the Thus-Gone One has done for us.
The Blessed One answered the venerable Śāradvatī­putra as follows
“Śāradvatī­putra, excellent! It is excellent that you have donned strong armor to delight the bodhisattva great beings
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, there will be a period and a time when not even the name of such a vehicle will exist, and when, Śāradvatī­putra, such a vehicle will be ridiculed and reviled, and such sūtras will not be upheld, but discarded
Śāradvatī­putra, noble sons or daughters who desire the meaning should then rely upon the meaning, rely upon the Dharma, and not dwell in crowded places
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the assembly at that time will be inappropriate, whereas
Śāradvatī­putra, my appropriate hearers will not discard, revile, or disregard such sūtras
For, Śāradvatī­putra, such acts are inappropriate
And that is because, Śāradvatī­putra, such childish acts are not appropriate acts, not the acts of the wise, whereas I, Śāradvatī­putra, perform wise acts, not childish acts
“Śāradvatī­putra, my hearers should train as follows
Śāradvatī­putra, in the future, whoever appears with devotion, learning, diligence, mindfulness, and propriety, who searches for what is virtuous, is interested in the Dharma, and makes great efforts to pursue the Dharma, will also be ridiculed and disparaged
It will be charged, ‘They are lazy
They cannot attain the result
They indulge in pleasure
They want to indulge in pleasure
Those so-called “bodhisattvas” consume what was offered out of devotion
And even though they constantly preach that vehicle, the Thus-Gone One has not taught that they are coherent and fluent speakers.
Śāradvatī­putra, fools will also insult me with all manner of such divisive words, and charge that those whom the Thus-Gone One has taught to be supremely coherent and supremely fluent speakers are in fact not coherent and fluent
“Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, those who dwell in households will be tormented, and thus come to believe that they should have faith in those fools
I can assure you that they will disparage bodhisattva great beings who uphold such sūtras even though they see them
Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One has taught, ‘You should not harm, violate, or disparage anyone whether they are right or wrong.’ Nevertheless
they still speak to others in this way, and act in this way to me too. Just consider what will become of the collected teachings on discipline due to those fools
Śāradvatī­putra, they will conceive of what is Dharma as not Dharma, and what is not Dharma as Dharma
They will conceive of what is not discipline as discipline, and discipline as what is not discipline. They will conceive of what is suitable as what is not suitable, and what is not suitable as what is suitable. They will conceive of what is free as not free, and what is not free as free
Consider, Śāradvatī­putra, how they will be in error for as long as they neither understand discipline, nor fathom the depths of the Teacher’s teaching
“Śāradvatī­putra, those beings will be overwhelmed by hostility, anger, and jealousy. They will also be overwhelmed by pride
Since they praise themselves and criticize other
they will be racked with jealousy and miserliness
They will be filled with non-virtuous qualities and distant from all virtuous qualities, making them irredeemable
Śāradvatī­putra, those beings are to be abandoned
Śāradvatī­putra, I am the teacher to those with shame
I am not the one for the shameless
Śāradvatī­putra, I am the teacher to the mindful, not the forgetful
Śāradvatī­putra, I am the teacher to the insightful, not the foolish
Śāradvatī­putra, my hearers are not those who will contravene and go against the nature respected by the thus-gone ones. For this is the reality that the thus-gone ones have trained in for a long time, the very nature of a great being, which they attained through their training. This is also the same reality that bodhisattva great beings must accomplish in order to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. And it is also each of the wisdoms that bodhisattvas are equipped with to free immeasurably many beings from the web of afflictions
I am not their teacher, because
Śāradvatī­putra, they are no good, no good
Śāradvatī­putra, that is all I can say about them
“Śāradvatī­putra, you should dwell in a place with Dharma, not elsewhere
Be your own refuge, and do not have another refuge
Keep the Dharma, and nothing else, as your refuge
This is what you have been taught
Śāradvatī­putra, how do monks come to dwell in a place with Dharma, and not elsewhere
How are they their own refuge, and not someone else
How are they, and no other, their own protector
Well, Śāradvatī­putra, monks are to cultivate the applications of mindfulness and dwell free of desire
Through abandoning it they are transformed
And what, Śāradvatī­putra, is the application of mindfulness
The application of mindfulness regarding the absence of entity, absence of nature, and absence of characteristics is seeing phenomena exactly as they are
Śāradvatī­putra, this is how mindfulness is applied by means of the absence of entity and the absence of nature
Śāradvatī­putra, whoever is undeceived in this regard is called a place with Dharma, a Dharma refuge, a protector of oneself, a refuge of oneself
Śāradvatī­putra, those who cultivate such an application of mindfulness are called worthy ones free of all expression , who have exhausted the defilements , and are free of afflictions, objects of generosity, tranquil, gentle, divested of faults , and brahmins who have reached the other shore of pure conduct and arrived on dry land
“So why, Śāradvatī­putra, are they called worthy ones 
Śāradvatī­putra, they are worthy in all virtues
Through virtuous actions they are free of all formations an
they have cut the chain of all formations
Being divested of all formations
Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones have exhausted the defilements, and thereby lack the basis and circumstance for formations even to form merit, let alone non-merit
This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, as the worthy ones have exhausted defilements, they have interrupted craving. Śāradvatī­putra, as the worthy ones have exhausted defilements, they have escaped from all fetters and are free of all phenomena, unsullied by any phenomenon, devoid of mental attachment, unattached to the desire realm, unattached to the form realm, unattached to the formless realm, free of longing, free of craving, and free of hostility
“Why is it that worthy ones are said to have exhausted the defilements 
Śāradvatī­putra, having exhausted all their defilements, they attain exhaustion with respect to all phenomena
By having thus attained exhaustion, they are said to have exhausted the defilements 
Why, then, are they said to be free of afflictions 
Since all things are emptiness, they are neither afflicted, nor purified
Thus being pristine and utterly unsullied by what is desired or undesired, pleasant or unpleasant, or compounded or uncompounded, they are unsullied
Thus, Śāradvatī­putra, since worthy ones having exhausted the defilements means that they have abandoned all conceptual constructs, they are said to be free of afflictions
“Why is it also that worthy ones are said to have exhausted the defilements 
They have abandoned torment and complete misery
Since they have completely quelled torment and grant the gift of the supreme Dharma free from worldliness, they are thus called objects of generosity 
Why are they called masters 
Śāradvatī­putra, seeing all phenomena as void, they have actualized and cultivated that state
They have perfected the sublime truth regarding all these void phenomena and expelled those with incorrect speech
Thus, they are called masters 
Why are they called brahmins 
This is because they have removed, discarded, and uprooted all phenomena. Being unsullied by these phenomena, they are thus divested of wicked deeds
Why are they called pacifiers 
Śāradvatī­putra, this is because they have pacified all wicked deeds and what is derived from all wicked phenomena
“Why are they called feelers 
Śāradvatī­putra, they have subdued the desire realm, the form realm, the formless realm, maturation, error, and untruth, and have also subdued karma and its maturation
So, Śāradvatī­putra, since they have no concepts, they have also subdued and liberated all phenomena derived from concepts. Thus, they are called feelers 
Why are they called those who have reached the other shore 
Śāradvatī­putra, having vanquished Māra and all the afflictions associated with the faction of Māra, they have crossed over all phenomena, reaching the other shore to arrive on dry land
Thus, they are called those who have reached the other shore
Śāradvatī­putra, no matter how much I describe the qualities of worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements, they themselves will never be exhausted, Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements are great fields that are completely purified and fully cultivated, with neither stones nor thorns
Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements, even when they are criticized and reviled, do not think, ‘I am being criticized and reviled.
Whether they are spoken to with praise or blame, they do not think, ‘I am being spoken to with praise,’ or, ‘I am being spoken to with blame.
Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have cut the chain of all thinking
“Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have nothing to guard
Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have nothing to guard whatsoever, fo
their faculties are well guarded and they have attained the level of certainty
This is because they are lamps of the Dharma, they are protectors of the Dharma, they are lamps for themselves, they are protectors of themselves
It is for this reason, Śāradvatī­putra, that monks who abide in this way should be known as worthy ones. That is, as long as they do not discard the thus-gone ones’ awakening, or perform inappropriate acts, or perform any wicked deeds related to skillful practitioners of pure conduct, but rather set out to ensure that awakening is guarded, not violated, and not abandoned, but remains for a long time
“Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have no doubt about the Dharma with respect to phenomena
Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have no hesitation and are free of indecision
Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have crossed—they have definitely crossed over the craggy path
They dwell on straight ground
They are straight
They have become straight
They have arrived through a straight path.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements do not abandon the Dharma, but search for it
This is because, Blessed One, those things done to abandon the Dharma are acts of the immature, not the acts of worthy ones.
responded the Blessed One to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Śāradvatī­putra, it is so, it is so,
“Śāradvatī­putra, they are indeed the acts of the immature and not the acts of worthy ones. However
Śāradvatī­putra, in the future there will appear monks overwhelmed by audacity
They will be convinced that they have become free of afflictions through mere concentration, mere wearing of the right clothes, and mere dwelling in the forest, and thus develop conceit
Therefore, at that time, most devout brahmins and householders and most of those with trust will also be convinced, thinking, ‘Those worthy ones are objects of generosity. They have exhausted the defilements,’ and thus believe that they should treat those monks as special
Overwhelmed in this way by honor, gain, praise, fame, and renown, those foolish monks will be convinced of their own wisdom, thinking, ‘We have those qualities. We possess those qualities. We have exhausted the defilements. We have no afflictions.
Thus, while thinking of themselves as wise beings, they will in fact be immature beings
They will have meager comportment
The comportment of those that dwell in villages will change
The comportment of those that dwell in temples will change
The comportment of those that dwell in the forest will change. The comportment of those that dwell in the assembly will change
Their performance of physical and verbal actions will go unguarded
They will develop the notion that they have no afflictions
“Today, when the hearers deliver Dharma discourses that teach profundity, disengagement, and emptiness, their audiences listen to that Dharma
With veneration and respect they harken and place their attention unwaveringly upon the teaching. However
in the future, the leaders of such fools will criticize it, reviling and ridiculing it
They will instruct each other, saying, ‘This is not the speech of the Buddha. This is not the teaching of the Teacher.
Why will they say that
It is because they will be at odds with the Dharma, Dharma discipline, and discipline. So, believing that it is not the Dharma, they will call Dharma, non-Dharma; non-Dharma, Dharma; and non-discipline, discipline
Śāradvatī­putra, they will thus speak unflatteringly about the very Dharma that they receive, and then praise themselves and disparage others
Under the sway of pride in mere discipline, mere dwelling in the forest, mere concentration, mere wearing of the right clothes, mere study, mere learning, mere possession of an assembly, mere praise, mere flattery, mere gain, mere respect, mere fame, and mere renown, they will be destroyed by the pride of self-conceit
“When those who explain things exactly as they are teach the Dharma
those fools will only perform ever more heinous actions the more they listen to those Dharma discourses
Those fools will not think, ‘We are riddled with extremely non-virtuous actions.’ Rather
having become even more confirmed in their pride and ignorance, they will abandon those Dharma discourses
Having thus performed especially heinous karma
they will end up in the Hell of Incessant Pain
They will end up in the lower realms
Śāradvatī­putra, now I have resolved your doubts, so you can trust that I will also resolve such doubts about the Dharma for those Dharma preachers in the future who receive the Dharma, seek Dharma teachers, and uphold such sūtras
“Śāradvatī­putra, a thus-gone one knows all, has knowledge of all, sees all, and teaches all
Śāradvatī­putra, there is no Dharma that a thus-gone one has not known, seen, or heard
Śāradvatī­putra, a thus-gone one has acquired wisdom that is unimpeded throughout the three times
He is unobstructed and free
He has reached mastery and has no afflictions
He is self-arisen
He has no teacher
He proclaims the lion’s roar with ease
“Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, those fools are content with their conduct, purview, and path
They are not trained
Those fools will embark on the wrong path
Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that a son or daughter of noble family who has perfectly set out for unexcelled and perfect awakening should aspire for, practice, and delight in such qualities, with the thought, ‘It would not be right for me to lack strong faith in the awakening of the blessed ones and, by not considering this lack as faulty, fail to fully awaken.
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four factors which, if noble sons and daughters possess them, will cause them to abandon the awakening of the buddhas
What are those four factors
Śāradvatī­putra, when noble sons or daughters fall into the hands of evil companions and not into the hands of spiritual friends
they will attend upon , serve, and honor those evil companions; an
through so attending upon, serving, and honoring those evil companions, they will emulate them and thereby abandon awakening
Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, through strong attachment to self, bodhisattvas begin to perceive in terms of reference points, and then
upon hearing such profound Dharma discourses
they become terrified and out of fright jump off a very steep cliff
Śāradvatī­putra, sons and daughters of noble family with that second factor are made to abandon awakening
Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, noble sons and daughters who follow the proponents of the nirgranthas, or who apply the spells of the materialists, may be respected by many people, and that being the case
they do not consider the qualities of the buddhas and so are made to abandon them
Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas with perverted and degenerate discipline, who do not emulate those with proper training, abandon those who advocate austerity, criticize them, and have no devotion for them
Śāradvatī­putra, noble sons or daughters with those four factors are made to abandon awakening.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“Attending upon evil companions
They will emulate them
Thus abandoning the Dharma
They will not long for the Buddha’s awakening
“Having mingled with nirgrantha preachers And being inclined toward materialism
When they explain this teachin
It will be the true time of unwholesome intellects
“The immature will have the pride of the wise, And alas, have conceit that they are wise
Thus abandoning the Dharma
They will not awaken to the buddhas’ awakening
“While adhering to the perspective Of those that propound a self
Hearing the profound Dharma Will lead fools to abandon the Dharma
“They will not understand the significance Of emptiness beyond extremes, exactly as it is
They will therefore be made to abandon awakening
They will not understand its depths
“With perverted discipline and wicked qualities, They will be leaders in indulging in unclean thoughts. Those idiots will not train According to those with training
“For those with such qualities As unruliness, disobedience, Hurtfulness, and a wicked tongue There is no evil deed that is off limits
“Thus, abandon those things That are continually disparaged by the buddhas
And continually rely upon the Dharma Which is always praised by me
“Whoever wants to see buddhas, And listen to such Dharma, Should observe well the collected teachings on discipline
They will acquire the Dharma amidst that
“Whoever wants to enter among, And consider themselves part of, Those who adhere to the collected teachings on discipline, Should therefore rely upon discipline
“If they want to engage in such wisdom
The broad-minded teach discipline
The highest and best of awakenings Will then not be difficult for them to attain
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four qualities that those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle will have if they have set out to guard awakening
What are those four qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle are themselves excellent in discipline
They adhere to and are highly learned in virtuous qualities and the collected teachings on discipline
They are expert in the absolute and have not even associated with materialists
They will attain the pure awakening of a buddha, and
being inclined toward solitude, they will delight in forests and wildernesses
Śāradvatī­putra, those are the four qualities that those who have embarked on the Great Vehicle have when they have set out to guard awakening.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“Despite adhering to the collected teachings on discipline
They are not conceited due to discipline
They will continue to pursue the Dharma, Which is profound and of definitive meaning
“They will also pursue the awakening of a buddha, Which is pure, fully pure, and completely pure
They will not pursue the spells That are upheld by the nirgranthas
“Those who want the spells that are free of conflict Do not associate with materialists
They ascertain the qualities of the buddhas And guard the teaching constantly
“Those that do not cavort with women, Whose minds are disturbed, Take the support of the outlying forests, Which are empty, tranquil, and uninhabited
“Rely on those four qualities, Which I have praised as supreme and highest, And upon those teachings That show the meaning of awakening
“In many different places in the past They were relied upon as well
They fully guard wisdom
Through them my wisdom was accomplished
“By fully guarding the Dharma, You will not migrate to negative destinies
Always tranquil and pristine
You will be exalted even in form
“They will always be in possession of wealth
But having acquired it, they will be circumspect
They will point out its essence, Saying, ‘Wealth is impermanent.
“Whatever you give is yours to keep
Whatever you keep you lose
Both you and your amassed wealth Have come from abandoning everything
“They will obtain a fine retinue of attendants, And will act as their fine spiritual friends
They will unequivocally connect With the qualities praised by the buddhas
“They will aspire for such qualities themselves, And resolutely connect others with them too
They will thus acquire joy, And practice the sublime Dharma
“They will always be born to a prominent caste, Respected as supreme in the world, And will not act heedlessly, But rely continually on the Dharma
“They will please the perfect buddhas
Upon seeing them they will be inspired
Devout and joyous, They will make sublime offerings
“Body, life force, and wealth— They are all without essence
Upon seeing sublime beings
They will instantly teach the essence
“They will not entertain the idea That their bodies and wealth have any essence
It is rare for buddhas to appear, An
such leisures too are difficult to acquire
“They will also acquire the leisures there, An
upon acquiring them, they will not be discouraged
They will rely on going forth, The source from which wisdom is attained
“Elated and ecstatic, They will pursue sublime wisdom
They will also continually adhere to the Dharma, The source from which awakening is attained
“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four qualities that will encourage and delight those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle, thus rendering them steadfast
What are those four qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, having perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle
they discard all their possessions and wealth
They adhere to all the qualities of the collected teachings on discipline
Due to their profound qualities all their wisdoms are exalted, and being so exalted
they do not abandon the Dharma, even at the cost of life and limb
They also offer pleasing necessities to all monks who preach the Dharma, who receive the sublime Dharma, and who uphold such sūtras
Śāradvatī­putra, if those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle have those four qualities they will predict and confirm themselves abundantly.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“They distribute all enjoyments, And perfectly adhere to the collected teachings on discipline
Exalted in all teachings
They have no doubt about the Dharma of emptiness
“They receive the Dharma Of those who teach the Dharma
They also engage those who teach the Dharma By providing for their happiness
“They will thus acquire joy, And then acquire supreme joy
They will also predict themselves To become buddhas, supreme humans
“They will be prophesied by the buddhas, The fully awakened ones Of the past, future, and present. Thus they predict them to become victorious ones
“Adhering to the path to awakening Of the unexcelled vehicle of the buddhas
They will also rely on the Dharma Upon which the buddhas have relied
“Bodhisattvas rely Upon those things praised by the buddhas
They will adhere to the path, The unexcelled path to awakening
“When a vessel Is tossed into the sky, It does not become suspended And has no stationary position. “Likewise do bodhisattvas Never turn back On the path to awakening in which they train Until they attain awakening
“Just as when instructions Are imparted to a crowd, And it is not disbanded, But swiftly enlisted
“Likewise do bodhisattvas, Even while relying perpetually on the Dharma, Never abandon diligence Until awakening to buddhahood
“A tree will grow, Even when its roots Are constantly moved by people And occasionally entwined
“Even though it is cold and hot, according to season, Due to wind and sun, Its roots are eventually buried, And the tree yields flowers and fruit
“Thus, it provides delightful shade That pleases many beings, Who can enjoy the bounty of flowers and fruits, Filled with happy delight
“Likewise do bodhisattvas Engender the mind set on awakening, Then rely upon the Dharma, in a timely manner, And ask questions about it, in a timely manner
“They serve others at all times, Ask questions at all times, Make effort in a timely manner, And gently practice generosity, according to season
“They take their seat at the trunk of a tree, At the seat of awakening, in a timely manner, Destroy the wicked Māra, And awaken to buddhahood, in a timely manner
“In a timely manner they turn the wheel, Which has not been turned in the world
They tame beings and conduct discourses, In a timely manner
“The wise who have set out for awakening With such powerful minds Will awaken to sublime buddhahood, And remain ever inviolable in that state
“They should therefore rely on the Dharma, Repeatedly and in a timely manner
They will then awaken to buddhahood, in a timely manner, And turn the wheel, too, in a timely manner
“Śāradvatī­putra, if bodhisattvas possess four qualities, they will not regress or relapse from unexcelled and perfect awakening
These qualities will ensure that even after departing from this life bodhisattvas exercise the dominion of a universal monarch, pursue all the roots of virtue exactly according to their aspirations, become more powerful and physically larger, and acquire a body that is as firm as that of Nārāyaṇa
They will ensure that even after acquiring the dominion of a universal monarch, bodhisattvas will swiftly abandon the four continents and go forth from home to homelessness
They will ensure that having gone forth, bodhisattvas will acquire the four abodes of Brahmā, faultlessness, freedom from frivolity, and ease
They will ensure that after bodhisattvas die, they will be born into the world of Brahmā with a fortune equal to his, and after birth, that they acquire the very power of Brahmā
“What are those four qualities
Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas, upon seeing a thus-gone one’s stūpa dilapidated, take delight in restoring it, to the point of piling up as little as a single lump of clay
Second, Śāradvatī­putra, at places where nothing is built, crossroads of wide streets where many people convene, they make stūpas, storied buildings, stone pillars, statues of thus-gone ones, or any other memorial to the thus-gone ones’ qualities
such as, for instance, building stūpas of a thus-gone one for when he turned the wheel of Dharma, went forth, destroyed Māra at the trunk of the Bodhi tree, showed the great miracles of a thus-gone one, showed the great passing of a thus-gone one, descended from the gods, or ascended to the god realm
Third, Śāradvatī­putra, when they witness schisms in the saṅgha of hearers, where fights and arguments have erupted, bodhisattvas make efforts to bring all back together and restore harmony
Fourth, Śāradvatī­putra, when the teaching of the thus-gone ones is disappearing and deteriorating, bodhisattva great beings make efforts to guard and prevent from decline even as little as a single verse
Upholding the Dharma, or supporting those who preach the Dharma, they disregard life and limb, but they do not abandon the Dharma
Śāradvatī­putra, if bodhisattvas who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle possess those four qualitie
they will attain the specific qualities taught previously.
The Thus-Gone One then spoke these verses
“Seeing buddhas’ stūpas
They should restore those that have deteriorated
They will thus become more powerful, Physically larger, and fearless
“At the location of a crossroads of wide streets Where faith may dawn, They should make statues with relics, And thus demonstrate the qualities of a buddha. “This causes much merit to be generated
Whoever builds stūpas of the world-honored ones At crossroads, Their fame will spread
“Upon seeing schisms between hearers, In which they are arguing back and forth
Bodhisattvas will ask them to forgive one another, And create harmony among them
“Through those roots of virtue They will become fearless heroes
Their bodies will form As hard as Nārāyaṇa’s
“When people do not easily adhere to the Dharma, When the teaching is deteriorating, They will respectfully guard the Dharma, And disregard life and limb
“Likewise will they guard those Who uphold the Dharma. They will be protected by gods And blessed by buddhas
“By guarding the Dharma, They will become universal monarchs
Encircling the four continent
They will also rule according to the Dharma
“Because the wheel is turned and they are taught
They will not be heedless
They will always be conscientious
They will discard the kingdom and go forth
“As sage-kings with supernatural powers, They will cultivate the four concentrations
Having cultivated the abodes of Brahmā
They will always embody qualities
“After death they will also attain birth In the world of Brahmā
Becoming great there too
They will be masters of Brahmā
“These four are the supreme among the qualities, Praised by the savior of the world
I too relied on them before, While I was practicing the conduct of awakening
“Just as it was practiced before, I perfected that Dharma In which I trained, And awakened to unexcelled buddhahood
“Whoever relies on those qualities As I relied upon them before, Will be great everywhere And belong to an incomparable caste
“They will become kings
They will become lords over the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
They will become sublime lords, Over even the desire realm in its entirety
“Having traveled to the form realm
They will become lords there
They will become supreme in all places
Who would not train in their qualities
“Their practice of discipline will be perfect
They will be exalted in modesty and propriety
Their renunciation will be perfect
They will always attain excellence
“They will be excellent in diligence
Their forbearance and absorption will be excellent
Their insight will be unexcelled
They will be adept in the entire Dharma
“They will know full well All the quadrillion wishes That are perpetually made, whenever they are made
Thus, they will be adept in wishes
“They will know the topics of words As they are formed, instantaneously
They will be the great teachers of the highly learned, Who will themselves become great
“Just as the wise are exalted In insight and eloquence, So too will they always be resolute on awakening And discard the knowledge of non-Buddhists
“Their view will always be true
They will intensively cultivate the correct view
They will please the perfect buddhas And continually abandon unfavorable states
“O what vehicle, the Great Vehicle! It is praised by the buddhas
There is no one at all Who proclaims it to have negative qualities
“The blind have not proclaimed this
Nor have the deaf proclaimed it
Neither have the one-eyed, those with deformed hands and legs, Nor the hideous proclaimed it
“The poor will not proclaim it
Those of lesser qualities have not proclaimed it
Those with wicked qualities, Which cause them to be wicked, will not proclaim it
“Upon hearing about such wisdom And hearing such praise
Who but those without access to it Would not pursue such a wisdom
“Therefore, those who pursue wisdom Pursue the wisdom that is awakening out of delusion
By training in that wisdom
They will go beyond all phenomena
“I did not establish castes
Nor did I discuss birth either, Or distinguish between their colors
There is nothing inferior about my form body
“I am not lazy, But ever exalted in diligence
My discipline is always excellent
I have insight and settle well in equipoise
“In this way I have previously relied upon Qualities that are supreme and exalted
Just look at how they have ripened Through their fruits, or enjoyments
“My wisdom partakes Of the thousands upon billions Of world systems, And realms more numerous still
“It knows the thoughts Of all beings born there, As well as their conduct, And their wishes
“It knows whatever unpleasant talk Erupts among them
It knows also their punishments, And likewise, their arrests
“Viewing all those things With my awakened eye
I have understood how to ripen beings And will thus liberate them from the bonds of existence
“Having come at the right time, I will encourage them
I will instruct them at the right time
I will demonstrate the miraculous feats Through which they will be born
“To those who are attached to form, And to those who dwell on enjoyments, I will teach those as faulty, An
they will thus pass beyond suffering
“To those bound by the fetters of attachment to existence, Who adhere to views, I will teach them as faulty, An
they will thus pass beyond suffering
“Wherever such beliefs in existence will arise, Wherever those beings will dwell, And whatever they honor as supreme, I will transform into such bodies, And teach the true path
“Having understood the Dharma, They will say, ‘We will awaken to sublime awakening, Which we are now resolute upon,’ And then pay homage to me
“Having realized their root
I will also teach them the Dharma
I will deliver them from all suffering
I am the Victorious One who uproots pain
“I will teach them the Dharma So that they attain the peace of nirvāṇa
Having heard the Dharma from me
They will attain nirvāṇa
“In the case of such knowledge as mine, It partakes of all phenomena present, And likewise all phenomena In past times, and those in the future, too
“My body is supremely exalted
Its measure is unperceived
Even those with supernatural powers Cannot see a victorious one’s crown protuberance
“A buddha’s hands are infinite
My hands are immeasurable
They cover as many world systems As there are sands in the river Ganges
“Those who wonder about my color and form, When hearing that a buddha body will appear, Cannot know the color and shape Of a buddha’s body
“Whoever, wondering about my color and shape, Approaches me and looks, Will be made to see a variety of colors, But will not understand the features
“Upon seeing the body of a buddha
Through his supernatural power of mind-reading, Those beings will be enraptured And praise my body
“No one can fully see The body of a buddha
It will not appear at all To those with the eyes of gods
“Such is the blessing of the buddhas
Look here you
Know the body of a buddha To be that inconceivable body
“From a single pore of his skin Come such supernatural powers, Which act in such a way For the welfare of beings in all worlds
“Many tens of millions of light rays, Radiate from the pores of his skin, And illuminate many realms, And as many buddha realms
“Just as I now know beings, While seated on this seat, I also simultaneously know all beings In all worlds throughout the ten directions
“The wisdom of awakening is infinite— I cannot establish its parameters
If even I, with my omniscient wisdom, cannot, What need is there to mention the hearers here
“All buddhas are inconceivable
The qualities of the buddhas are inconceivable
Through having faith in the inconceivable, They will also become inconceivable.
This concludes the tenth chapter
Then, seven years after a child called Vijayarakṣa was born, he joined that very same assembly and took his seat
The boy Vijayarakṣa now rose from his seat, bowed with palms joined to the Blessed One, and requested in verse
“I have heard the Dharma of the buddhas
So I wish to request the armor
The inspiration thus born in me Compels me to think, may I too become like him
“Seer, through the gift of Dharma I will invite all beings as guests
I will speak in the words of the best of men
I will do just that and nothing else
“Guide, it is my aspiration Henceforth to enter no household
I will go forth precisely in this: The teaching of the world’s protector
“That is the fruition of renunciation, diligence, Virtuous qualities, concentration, Absorption, and insight
I will rely precisely upon those
“I am inspired by the seers
Allow me to go forth instantly
Having pursued the ochre robes
I will practice the most sublime of Dharmas
“With mirror-like wisdom I will reflect upon the world, And become supreme in the world
I beseech you to fully send me forth
“Since nothing at all exists, I will not dwell on the notion of beings, An
having thus manifestly and fully awakened
Guide, I will teach the Dharma
“Having destroyed Māra and his hordes
I will frighten all other non-Buddhists
Having destroyed the web of beliefs
I will work for the welfare of beings
“For them to attain the bliss of nirvāṇa I will teach the path
Since it is devoid of arising, The path is inconceivable
“Once I have unfolded the net of light
I shall let the Dharma shine
I will teach the Dharma, exactly as it is, In terms of its nature and character
“I will perform miracles through my supernatural power
I will demonstrate miraculous feats
I will resolve the doubts of everyone Who believes in a self.
The Blessed One then asked Vijayarakṣa
“Child, do you want to go forth from home to homelessness under this teaching of mine?
Vijayarakṣa replied
“Indeed, Blessed One,
The Blessed One said
“It is for those who do not already wear ochre robes, And whoever has no impurity— Those are the things to be accomplished, To go forth under my teaching
“Whoever’s hair is unshaven, And has severed all bonds, But is neither bound, nor free, Goes forth under this
“Whoever neither trains in the trainings, Nor confers the trainings, But has trained in all trainings Goes forth under this
“Whoever does not cling to the sublime Dharma, Yet cultivates all Dharma teachings, While having removed the notion of Dharma, Goes forth under this
“Whoever does not imagine ‘I,’ Does not imagine ‘being,’ And does not feel apprehensive Has set out for awakening
“Whoever has given rise to the mind of awakening, Does not focus on any other phenomena, And does not cling to mind Goes forth under me.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then thought
“How long has that child, to whom the Blessed One has just taught profound points, practiced them?
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra therefore spoke these verses to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what kind of practice Does the child Vijayarakṣa possess, Who is neither frightened nor timid Upon hearing the profound Dharma
“One who has no fear Upon hearing profound points Has in other lifetimes before Seen myriad perfect buddhas
“Undiscouraged By profound points, He has inquired about them Before myriad previous buddhas, the best of humans.
The Blessed One then answered the venerable Śāradvatī­putra with these verses
“I know that in the past, At this very place, Vijayarakṣa posed questions To many thousands of buddhas
While he was practicing the conduct of awakening, In Aṅga of Magadha
“He knew all the buddhas Who were queried in the past
“He became fully adept in the sound and unsound positions Regarding phenomena, the elements, The sense sources, emptiness, The immeasurables, and the liberations
“Ah, just as he knew the buddhas In Aṅga of Magadha, So too, through the scholars in the houses in Kāśi, Did he know all of them there
“The child Vijayarakṣa Has attained the perfection of insight
He is born from wholesome qualities
Therefore, he has such knowledge
“It has put him in touch with the Dharma here
He counts the seals according to the letter
He also knows the various other arts, And does not forget anything else
“Aside from the supramundane knowledge That all phenomena are emptiness, He does not speak of mundane knowledge, Nor cling to it as supreme
“With such wisdom He has not been deluded For hundreds of eons About the fact that all phenomena are emptiness
“That wisdom is great wisdom, Whose nature brings an end to afflictions
Whoever does not want emptiness, Will not enter the Dharma.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the child Vijayarakṣa
“Boy, will you go forth under the Thus-Gone One’s teaching?
Vijayarakṣa responded to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra
“Venerable Śāradvatī­putra, since I have already gone forth, I will not go forth.
The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then spoke these verses to the child Vijayarakṣa
“What garments have you donned? You were not given ochre
Nor has your hair been shaven
How could you have gone forth
“You have not trained in the trainings
You have no teacher, Nor a preceptor
How could you have gone forth
“You do not carry an alms bowl
You have come during retreat
What makes you gone forth
How are you restrained
“Where did you go forth with an assembly
Who allowed all this for you
How are you gone forth
Answer these questions!
The child Vijayarakṣa answered the venerable Śāradvatī­putra with these verses
“Whoever grasps ochre Without impurity and without clinging to it, And without clinging even to non-arising, Is wearing ochre
“I have grasped the robe of wisdom
It is never stained
I wear the ochre That is perpetually stainless and pristine
“I have abandoned all afflictions
Thus have I shaven my hair
I have shaven it with wisdom
It will not grow back again
“The alms bowl comes from the inconceivable
It is the vessel of all qualities
Neither filled nor depleted
It is the vessel of all qualities
“I never have, nor will I Adhere to the precepts of others
I will be all-knowing and self-arisen
That is my excellence
“The buddhas who equalize all phenomena Have spoken to me
I will traverse the path to awakening, Where the guides too have traveled
“My self-arising is thus, An
my training is also thus
Nirvāṇa is also like that, An
the act of speaking is the same
“I have trained today in conduct
At some point I will also Travel from field to field In pursuit of the savior of the world
“Seated at the seat of awakening
I will give inconceivable gifts
Not enjoying awakening alone
I will give it to ten million beings.
The Blessed One then glanced at the child Vijayarakṣa
No sooner had he looked at him than the boy was clad in ochre robes, sat down, an
it seemed as if his hair had been shaved for seven days
At that very moment he attained the five superknowledges
Then, while seated on that very spot, the boy Vijayarakṣa vanished
As soon as he vanished, the earth quaked, and everyone felt tingling waves of trepidation
Gods appeared from the sky, playing drums and singing divine melodies, an
the earth was flooded with a bright light
At that moment the Blessed One smiled
From the Blessed One’s mouth streamed light rays of many different colors, which circled the entire buddha realm three times before dissolving back into his crown protuberance
The venerable Ānanda then rose from his seat, draped his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and said to the Blessed One in verse
“Tamer of men, leader, best of beings, You who abide by conduct with exalted qualities
Victor who has perfected wisdom and non-attachment, Omniscient one, unexcelled victor, I ask you
“Many light rays streamed from your mouth, Pervading the entire buddha realm with their light
After circling the buddha realm
They returned and dissolved back into your crown protuberance
“The Buddha does not smile without a reason
For whose sake did you smile today
To whom will that prediction apply
Resolve my uncertainty, savior of the world
“Who caused you to show such a smile, And illuminate the entire buddha realm? To whom does that great significance apply
With your supreme wisdom, whom do you predict
“The adornment of the buddha realms was exquisite, An
all beings too were gladdened
We do not consider this to be haphazard, Such a miraculous feat as it was.
The Blessed One asked Ānanda
“Ānanda, did you see on this very spot the child Vijayarakṣa wearing ochre?
Ānanda replied
“Yes, Blessed One, I did,
said the Blessed One
“Ānanda,” “that child Vijayarakṣa is sitting with that very same body in the world system of Abhirati, the buddha realm of the thus-gone one Akṣobhya
Having practiced pure conduct in that buddha realm for his entire life, he will acquire dominion with that very body
just as Śakra, lord of the gods, has acquired dominion now
Even after he dies and departs from that buddha realm
he will travel from buddha realm to buddha realm with that same body, never parting from the buddhas
Wherever he goes with that body he has obtained, he will acquire dominion
Then, after a countless eon he will fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, becoming the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha who perpetually illuminates the world systems called Anantajñānavicita
Ānanda, the lifespan of the thus-gone one Anantajñānavicita will be immeasurable, such that its precise number of eons will not be possible to measure, calculate, or imagine
The beings who dwell in that thus-gone one’s buddha realm will not be born from a womb. Rather
they will be miraculously born, appearing cross-legged upon lotuses
Ānanda, that buddha realm will be adorned with other immeasurable, exalted qualities
“Ānanda, there are four qualities bodhisattvas may possess that will ensure that in their future lives too they will succeed in going forth, and will be told, ‘Monk, come join me!
What are those four qualities
Ānanda, bodhisattvas, having gone forth themselves, should also cause others to go forth and lead them to rely on going forth in all of its aspects
Once they have gone forth
bodhisattvas should delight them with a Dharma discourse and encourage them to uphold it
Ānanda, bodhisattvas with this first quality will succeed in going forth in their next lives too, and will be told, ‘Monk, come join me!
“Second, Ānanda, bodhisattvas should themselves apply diligence in pursuit of the qualities of the buddhas, and also lead others to uphold the application of diligence in pursuit of the qualities of the buddhas
Ānanda, bodhisattvas with this second quality will succeed in going forth in their next lives too, and will be told, ‘Monk, come join me!
“Third, Ānanda, bodhisattvas themselves should be forbearing and gentle, while also causing others to perfect forbearance and gentleness
They themselves should observe the quality of austerity, while they also establish others in the perfect quality of austerity
They themselves should be insightful, while they also establish others in perfect insight
Ānanda, bodhisattvas with that third quality will succeed in going forth in their next lives too, and will be told, ‘Monk, come join me!
“Fourth, Ānanda, bodhisattvas themselves should be skilled in means and possess the power of aspiration, while also leading others to uphold skill in means and imbuing others with the power of aspiration
Ānanda, bodhisattvas with these four qualities will succeed in going forth in their next lives too, and will be told, ‘Monk, come join me!’ and travel from buddha realm to buddha realm, attaining dominion wherever they go in that very body, while also remaining circumspect throughout
“Ānanda, there are four qualities bodhisattvas may possess that will ensure that their progress toward unexcelled and perfect awakening will never relapse or be reversed
What are those four qualities
Ānanda, bodhisattvas should altruistically engender the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening
They should delight in a thus-gone one’s teaching
They should not rest content with merely hearing the Dharma
They should speak the truth without deception
Ānanda, if bodhisattvas have those four qualitie
their progress toward unexcelled and perfect awakening will never be reversed or relapse.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“Perfect in altruism, They will seek to see buddhas
They will not rest content with the Dharma
They will abide by true words
“Seeing the suffering of beings
They will engender altruism
Understanding altruism, They will teach the Dharma to beings
“When hearing such teachings
They are never satiated
It makes them apply diligence In developing their knowledg
“They will always speak true words
They will abide by true words
Just as they speak, So too will they be, and not otherwise
“They will frequently rely upon These four qualities, And thus attain sublime awakening, And develop the finest of vision
“Upon hearing about such qualities, Whose maturation is explained to be Immeasurable and inconceivable
Who would not abide by those qualities
“Ānanda, there are four qualities that ensure that the mindfulness of those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle will not deteriorate, tha
they receive encouragement from the gods, tha
they do not part from objects of generosity, and tha
they can serve as objects of generosity themselves in case there is no object of generosity present
The four are as follows
Ānanda, bodhisattva great beings are delighted to make others uphold unexcelled and perfect awakening
They are delighted to honor the thus-gone ones
They are delighted to pursue the Dharma
They also provide Dharma preachers with pleasant objects an
upon seeing beings suffer they comfort them with fearlessness
Ānanda, if bodhisattvas who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle have those four qualities, the
in their future lives they will not forget, and they will not part from objects of generosity
And even if no object of generosity can be found
they themselves will serve as objects of generosity.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“They will honor the perfect buddhas, And pay respect to the Dharma too
They will also respectfully honor The monks who preach the Dharma
“Upon seeing beings tormented by fear And suffering without a guide
They will give them fearlessness, And thus protect them from the torment of fear
“Through that root of virtue They will receive visions of buddhas
Gods will also encourage them, Saying, ‘Rise, you, and apply diligence!
“If they do not see a buddha, They do not see a hearer, And they do not see a solitary buddha To serve as an object of generosity for this world
“They will renounce all by themselves, And go forth into homelessness
They will rely upon a tranquil forest And swiftly attain the five superknowledges
“Having attained the five superknowledges
They will wander all around this earth
Visiting towns and countries
They will ensure that beings receive the Dharma
“Having heard the Dharma from them
Beings will abandon evil
No longer perpetuating evil deeds
Beings will become respectful
“Beings will go forth under their auspices, Thinking, ‘I will attain nirvāṇa under them, For just as they became supreme due to the highest Dharma, I too will now do the same!
“If one practices the Dharma
Such qualities appear In oneself and others
So who would not constantly practice the Dharma
“Therefore, those who pursue awakening Will practice those qualities
Their wisdom of awakening will be inconceivable An
they will not regress from it
“I too relied on those in the past, And am thus supremely exalted
Having intensively trained in those qualities
The wisdom of awakening was not difficult to discover
“I am a fully awakened one in the world
I am unexcelled in the world
Teaching the Dharma Of unexcelled wisdom—what a delight
“That is why, Ānanda, according to that explanation, bodhisattva great beings by all means should obtain those qualities and thus be understood to bring benefit through those qualities
“Ānanda, a countless eon ago there appeared in this world a king called He Who Resounds Throughout the Quarters
Ānanda, a son was born to the main wife of that king
Ānanda, as soon as the boy was born, the gods proclaimed in unified cadence and wording, ‘A being who practices the Dharma has come into the world!
Ānanda, upon hearing those words, the prince was scared, thinking, ‘What is this, Dharma or non-Dharma?
“Ānanda, when about seven years had passed after the prince was born, he went before the king, prostrated to his feet, and sat to one side
Seated there, he said to the king
‘Father, what is this, Dharma or non-Dharma?
“The king responded to the boy with this verse
“ ‘The Dharma—by which the evil deed of taking life is abandoned; Generosity, restraint, and pure conduct are observed; And the qualities of gentleness and discipline are adhered to— Is praised by the noble ones.
“Ānanda, the prince then spoke these verses to his father
“ ‘Father, can householders, Who wield dominion over Jambudvīpa, Rely on the Dharma, the Dharma of which you speak to me
Please clarify this question I have posed
“ ‘Tell me if they can
You should tell me if I can
There are no truth-tellers in the hells
They will not partake of negative destinies at all
“ ‘Those who tell lies will go to negative destinies
They will reach the Hell of Incessant Pain and experience suffering
Therefore, please cast off lies, An
tell me the truth in true words!
“Ānanda, the king then spoke these verses to the prince
“ ‘Those who wield dominion over Jambudvīpa Are unable to rely on the entire Dharma
If they rule the earth with the weapon of a scepter
Where, boy, would the Dharma appear for them
“ ‘I harm living beings
With those who do not immediately heed my command, I steal their enjoyments, punish them, And then put them in jail
“ ‘When they get out to behold the fine land
They will be frightened of our cities
When they hear that the king is coming, they are frightened, And wander from place to place
“ ‘When I was immersed in such matters, If there was a person that slighted me, the king
The king would know and say, “Punish him!
Thus he would be offered and delivered to me
“ ‘I did not know that was wrong, And so committed evil for the sake of others
I ordered, “By all means, henceforth beat, capture, and kill, To prevent them from committing evil against my instructions.
“ ‘If others were to act in emulation of tha
My territory would thus suffer
I would punish them by destroying them, An
based on that, the cities would be afraid
“ ‘A fierce king who is hard on the people Will immediately frighten beings
You will thus be taught to have compassion for beings when harming them, And not to be attached to victory.
“Then the boy, upon hearing those words, Spoke these verses to the king
‘I have become sad and am suffering
Father, I long to rely on the Dharma
“ ‘Father, I am not interested in dominion here
For I would commit evil for the sake of others
Abandoning parents and kingdom, Father, I long to pursue the Dharma
“ ‘Father, if you do not let me go
I will kill myself, Father
I will drink poison, or throw myself off a mountain into a chasm
I will kill myself with a weapon, Father!
“Hearing those words, the king was displeased and said
‘Prince, listen to these words of mine
Prince, you should continually indulge in desire
I will attend to the kingdom
“ ‘Prince, do not go forth from the home
Prince, frolic in the garden
I will give you many lavish enjoyments
Prince, what good do you think going forth will bring you
“ ‘First indulge in exquisite pleasures, one by one
Then you can go forth once the enjoyments are spent!
The prince replied, ‘At the same time, I find a few faults in this, So in this short life I will give rise to nirvāṇa alone
“ ‘I will not be content indulging my desires. I would through this create faulty and afflicted karma
I will go forth faultlessly and practice the Dharma
I will rely on love to benefit all beings
“ ‘I will dwell alone in forested places
From that great bliss will come
By adhering to discipline I will practice pure conduct and be tranquil
I will thus rely on hundreds of forests
“ ‘You should go forth in emulation of me
What good to you are the territory and its cities
By committing evil for the sake of others, You will dwell in negative destinies and experience suffering there
“ ‘Then you will swallow The giant metal ball of terror, Father
By committing incomparable evil
Beings are born into the hells
“ ‘Their bodies will be pinned down with a metal dagger, Then crushed from above with a metal door leaf
Metal ploughs will appear there, That crush their bodies completely
“ ‘Those with especially heinous karma Will be placed by Harikeśa upside down inside vases, And be frightened by metal clubs
They will be made to endure that sensation for many years
“ ‘They will not be killed there, moreover, But be sustained by their wicked actions
Once the karma is spent, they will gain freedom
Such is the fruition of wicked actions
“ ‘But when death comes to their bodies, They will enter terrifying firepits
These will severely burn their bodies, Then overwhelm them with terrifying flames
“ ‘When they have escaped from the pits of fire, They will scale a steep rock mountain, Which is blazing with terrifying flames
Then, they will enter a swamp of filth
“ ‘That will also be blazing with terrifying flames
And they will then eat with mouths like needles. Then, mired in that for ten million years
They will emerge from it only after one hundred such lifetimes
“ ‘Then, there are also frightening groves of arrows there, Which will inflict supremely awful pain upon them
They will be shredded by sword-like leaves, Surrounded by terrifying flames
“ ‘As soon as they enter those groves, Gusts of wind will emerge from the four quarters
The swords, thus rustled by the blowing winds, Will lacerate their bodies all over
“ ‘When they have escaped from those groves, They will enter other terrifying groves
There they will be killed by sword-like leaves And revived by leaves that are like razors
“ ‘As soon as they enter the terrifying sword groves, Wind will rise from the four quarters
With the wind thus roused, they will be cut with sword leaves, An
then their bodies will be cut to pieces
“ ‘Then, as their bodies are being cut up
The swords blown by the wind will fall, An
the sword-leaves will pierce their bodies
They will experience such sensations of pain there
“ ‘After having experienced such pain for many years
They will be transformed and enter molten rivers
Having experienced pain there for many years
They will be transformed and enter swiftly rushing molten rivers
“ ‘Into that torrent of boiling copper and iron, Deep and rushing with a thousand waves, People will fall headlong and die
They will die submerged by the force of waves
“ ‘Submerged by the force of these giant waves
They will then enter the river of terror, And die there by sinking without reaching the bottom
Who would want to endure that pain
“ ‘Once they have crossed, Violent and terrifying rākṣasas dwelling on the banks, Who gnash their teeth and have greenish-orange hair, Will chase them down at a run, and capture them
“ ‘Once captured they will be asked, “Friends, show us what you eat! What would you like?
Their reply will be: “We would like to eat some food, For we are hungry.
“ ‘Quickly seized by those supremely terrifying beings
They will be tossed atop a metal surface
Their bodies will be split open, And they will be fed the metal balls that fall to earth
“ ‘Burned inside and out, They will cry out, “We are being scorched and roasted!
They will fall into a gushing, painful river
A river with water they perceive as icy
“ ‘Thereafter they will enter the swamp of filth, And likewise the mountain and the forest of razor blades, As well as the terrifying firepits, Thus experiencing those sensations again and again
“ ‘This kingdom of yours is not permanent, Father
Īśvara does not follow far behind
“Life force, kingdom, and likewise, pleasures— Everything is impermanent,” taught the victorious ones
“ ‘Henceforth do as I say, Father
Renounce everything and go forth
After dying and departing from this life you will delight in pleasant destinies
You will be free from all suffering, Father
“ ‘Abiding by discipline and concentrations, and with a loving attitude
Dwelling in isolated, tranquil forests
Who would not want to be like me
You will become like Brahmā.
“Once the prince had taught in this way, He abandoned the kingdom and perfectly went forth
The king and the queen did the same, So there was no one at all to thwart him
“In pursuit of the bliss of concentration
He went forth and pursued the Dharma
He attained the superknowledges and became a king of sages
Teaching the Dharma to benefit the world
“Through teaching that phenomena are selfless
His thoughts were calmed, his mind tranquil
He said, ‘There is no self or anything belonging to a self
The so-called “self” has never been perceived.
“As that king of sages taught that Dharma, Of how all phenomena are neither bound nor liberated, And how there is no sentient being and nothing belonging to a self, You should reflect on that and perfectly discern it
“Upon hearing that king of sage’s Dharma
Many hundreds of thousands assembled there
Then the king went forth, And the queen, too, went forth under the auspices of his teaching
“Having gone forth under the sage, They thought, ‘Where such teachings exist, On which the sage has embarked, We too must acquire those!
“Thus training as the sage taught
They all embarked on this for supreme awakening
They all became destined for awakening, And then awakened to buddhahood, quelling all
“If you, Ānanda, have doubt That the prince from that time, Who upon being taught the Dharma, Pursued it fully and went forth, was someone else
“Do not, Ānanda, have doubt about this
For I was the prince then
I acted for the great welfare of beings
I also established them in the supreme vehicle
“Having turned the wheel of Dharma then
I never allowed my diligence to wane
I never abandoned my resolve
I trained constantly and consistently
“I relied on those qualities continuously
I was never lazy
I never doubted peace, Thinking that I could not attain awakening
“I always had the aspiration for awakening
I constantly applied sublime diligence
I constantly sought out well-spoken teachings
My joy thus became unexcelled
“Therefore, if those who want awakening Train as I have trained
Their training will never regress from awakening, An
they will turn the sublime wheel of Dharma.
This concludes the eleventh chapter
“Ānanda, there are four qualities that bodhisattvas may have that will equip them with mindfulness, realization, intelligence, propriety, experience, and comportment
What are those four qualities
Ānanda, bodhisattvas apply effort to pursue such qualities
Once they have found them, they also become accomplished in those qualities
Adhering to them themselves, they also lead many other beings to uphold the same qualities
Leading them to uphold them, they also delight them with Dharma discourses and thus encourage them.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“Whoever pursues those qualities That lead to their happiness, Should not let go of their diligence Without finding such qualities
“Having heard such a Dharma, they should become learned
Always adhering to the Dharma, they should train as taught
They should establish others in the Dharma, just as they themselves observe it
Those who already adhere to this Dharma should not be instructed further
“Moreover, Ānanda, for the sake of such teachings, bodhisattvas should constantly follow Dharma preachers, thinking, “How awful if those teachings were to disappear after I hear them! How awful if any Dharma were to go to waste!
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“The monks who continually rely on these teachings Become highly learned
They are honored by the King of Dharma, And follow me in these
“ ‘If I do not listen to the Dharma or understand its meanings, It will disappear, and I will not receive it from others later.
Thus, applying constant diligence, they abandon all other activity, And pursue the Dharma through which knowledge is surely developed
“Skilled and insightful monks Rely on that which is honored by the victorious ones
Those who are broad minded based on wide learning Pursue such sūtras
“Moreover, Ānanda, even while bodhisattva great beings teach the Dharma to others, precisely as they heard and mastered it, they do not regress from the Dharma
Ānanda, what makes bodhisattvas regress from the Dharma
It is the following: Although they teach the Dharma about profound emptiness, they may teach based on alms, bedding, seating, medicine, and utensils, such that they are given material objects first and then teach
In that case, although others are indeed taught the Dharma, this has in no way been engaged in properly
Thus, Ānanda, do bodhisattvas regress from the Dharma.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“Although upon hearing such teachings, They spread them to many people
When teachers teach out of concern for their life, So that they themselves may retain their status, “They will never be sought after, Even if they are said to be ‘excellent.
Those who teach the sublime Dharma Motivated by compassion toward others, “Teach the Dharma Out of love for all beings, And compassion for many beings
They thus practice loving kindness for beings
“Those who teach such Dharma In pursuit of gain, And who pursue Dharma on that account, Regress from the Dharma
“The wise who abide properly By the Dharma, as it was taught, Will not regress through gain, But always uphold the Dharma
“The buddhas of the world Give their benediction of ‘excellent’ To those who eloquently teach the Dharma And adhere to the Dharma too.
“Furthermore, Ānanda, bodhisattva great beings pursue the Dharma
They do not maintain any depravity as Dharma preachers
They do not maintain anything deemed to be faulty
They pursue the Dharma according to the Dharma
They pursue the Dharma with the intention of engaging in the Dharma
Ānanda, how do bodhisattvas pursue the Dharma according to the Dharma
When they practice according to their preceptor’s and teacher’s command, they do what they have done an
they joyfully make use of the religious robes, alms bowl, bedding, seating, medicines, and utensils
Thus, Ānanda, should bodhisattvas pursue the Dharma.
The Blessed One then spoke these verses
“They pursue teachings
They do not pursue controversy
They will observe the Dharma Exactly as it was taught to others
“Those who pursue the Dharma there Adhere to it exactly as it was taught
Adhering to the Dharma, The valiant rely on the Dharma constantly
“Thus, those who pursue the Dharma Adhere to it exactly as it was taught
And those who adhere to the Dharma, Are foremost in the Dharma
“They will reach the Dharma Just as I reached it
In reliance on those teachings I attained unexcelled awakening
“Understanding how to perceive as teachers All those from whom I received it
I thus respected the teachings, By pursuing the Dharma constantly
“It is the path that I followed— It is my master
It is my blissful guide
It is what cleansed my vision
“It is my teacher— Thus I always adhere respectfully to it
Based on it I am happy in this defective world
“Innumerable eons ago— Inconceivably long ago—in Vaiśālī, There was a thus-gone one Called King of Mountains
“After King of Mountains passed away
There was a hearer called Wise One
Being skilled and very insightful, He bestowed transmission of many teachings
“He had ascertained the profound meaning, Was adept in the aggregates and constituents, Had perfected vinaya, And was also adept in abhidharma
“He was trained in all three trainings, Upheld the buddhas’ awakening, And was authorized By Buddha King of Mountains
“He had embarked on the buddhas’ supreme vehicle, And was also adept in the profound
The limit of Wise One’s qualities Was impossible to demonstrate
“In the royal house of Puṣpavati There was a rich merchant
He was replete with great wealth, And beamed with the splendor of merit
“As he lived there He was known as Mahārhata
But, being disciplined and replete with excellent qualities, He was also known as Rūpavati
“The merchant Rūpavati once Approached Wise One, Whereupo
the insightful and learned being Taught him the Dharma
“Upon hearing the sublime Dharma From the renowned Wise One
He would use his infinite wealth To collect all those teachings
“Wise One said, ‘Such generosity you have shown. Merchant, it is excellent that you are so devout
That knowledge you have heard Is the treasure of Dharma.
“Then the merchant Rūpavati Attended upon Wise One
For a great many years He followed him
“For twenty years, While the merchant followed the Dharma preacher, The preacher made the merchant listen to the teachings from him, Yet the merchant still wanted more teachings
“Although many people always served The merchant in pleasing ways
His mind was never free From being tormented
“He once offered To Wise One Two hundred million gold ingots in full, Which Wise One accepted
“On another such occasion, He brought a heap of gold to him
Through being served so, Wise One was thus pleased
“Later, on a thousand occasions, He paid visits to each monk
As they followed the Dharma Preached by Wise One
“Joining in on those occasions
He constantly gave them each three religious robes, Totaling twenty thousand ingots of gold
Such were his movements everywhere
“For the sake of each and every monk, Rūpavati Respectfully commissioned Further rest houses and other things
“And in each and every rest house He also had gold put in place, Equaling two hundred million ingots in full, And erected various porticoes too
“Then, on one occasion, while Wise One was teaching him The most sublime Dharma
He finished his work for the benefit of beings And left behind his body there
“Rūpavati went forth And, once the body had been cremated, Had an expansive stupa built Measuring eight leagues wide
“He also equipped the stūpa with gems
And once the stūpa was consecrated, He worshiped it day and night With flowers, incenses, and perfumes
“After the rich merchant Had died there
He never migrated to unpleasant destinies Since he had pleased many buddhas
“By his roots of virtue, For eight hundred million eons He continually became Brahmā And constantly beheld buddhas
“For eight hundred million eons He continually served as king of the gods In the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, And constantly beheld buddhas
“For eight hundred million eons, He continually became a universal monarch, Constantly beheld buddhas, And upon seeing them, also honored them
“During that time, The merchant known as Rūpavati Pleased many tens of millions of buddhas— Eight hundred quadrillion of them
“Pleasing the victorious ones, He made infinite offerings on those occasions
Then after receiving the Dharma
He went before his wife to teach her
“If you think, Ānanda, That the householder Then known as Rūpavati, Who appeared in the royal house of Puṣpavati, was someone else
“Do not see it that way
For that Rūpavati Who made offerings To the Dharma preacher, the monk Wise One, was me
“I made such offerings In order to receive the Dharma
Through that very root of virtue, I attained awakening here
“I have still not exhausted The heap of merit From the great merit that I performed Due to the Dharma preacher Wise One
“Based on what I attained through Immeasurable and innumerable merits
I have continually beheld buddhas And received the Dharma from them
“Precisely as they have been taught, So too do they all teach me
Since that is the path to awakening You should rely on that!
The venerable Ānanda then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, given that the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha acquired such an abundance of merit
it is wonderful that the Blessed One’s previous bodies would also be so exalted
Blessed One, has the monk called Wise One who appeared then passed into nirvāṇa?
said the Blessed One
“No, Ānanda,” “that monk has still not passed into nirvāṇa. For
Ānanda, he is practicing bodhisattva conduct under this teaching of mine.
The venerable Ānanda then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, how wonderful it is that, although the merchant Rūpavati has fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on the collection of roots of merit he gained by serving and honoring the Dharma preacher Wise One, the monk Wise One has still not fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.
The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, the monk Wise One did not perfectly embark as I perfectly embarked. For
Ānanda, the monk Wise One perfectly embarked through the vehicle of pleasure, not through the vehicle of suffering, wherea
I, Ānanda, reached perfection over a long period of time through the vehicle of suffering
Moreover, Ānanda, while I was previously practicing bodhisattva conduct over a long period of time I made the aspiration, ‘As long as beings suffer and most of them are inclined toward negative destinies, fall into negative destinies, and have fallen into negative destinies, I will, having awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, completely free those beings from suffering!
“Ānanda, I cannot even illustrate with any analogy how the monk Wise One initiated a vow, made a vow, persevered, and aspired, nor for how long, Ānanda, the monk Wise One has journeyed toward unexcelled and perfect awakening through such a great vow. Ye
the monk Wise One has perfectly set out for unexcelled and perfect awakening, fo
he has accumulated and is still accumulating roots of virtue with the thought, ‘May all the beings who behold me while I am practicing bodhisattva conduct resolutely go forth through the Great Vehicle, or the vehicles of the hearers or solitary buddhas.’ 
The venerable Ānanda then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, is the monk Wise One who appeared back then present in this retinue?
said the Blessed One
“Ānanda, the monk who was called Wise One then is present right here,
“He is this one seated before me.
the venerable Ānanda exclaimed
“Blessed One, how amazing this assembly of pure beings is!
agreed the Blessed One
“Indeed, Ānanda, indeed,
“Ānanda, the assembled retinue of great and pure beings is, accordingly, an assembly of bodhisattvas, an assembly of lions, an assembly of fearless ones, and an assembly of great elephants.
asked Ānanda
“Blessed One, why is this called a great assembly and an assembly of lions?
“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One, “it is called a great assembly and an assembly of lions because it dons the armor of immeasurable, innumerable beings to vanquish the great darkness of ignorance
“Ānanda, it is like this, as a simile: Wherever the lion, the king of beasts, settles and resides no one else can settle
Lesser creatures, unable to withstand the odor, will flee, an
when they happen to cross that place, they will fall to the ground on their backs upon smelling that odor
Likewise, Ānanda, wherever the assembly of great lions resides, Ānanda, no others—such as Māra, the gods from the realm of Māra, or any other beings under Māra’s spell—can settle
If they should happen to set foot in that place, they will feel pain and unhappiness and will have to leave the entourage and disappear right at that very moment
Unable to withstand the charisma of those fearless great lions, they take their leave from them
“Ānanda, it is also like this, as a simile: When a lion, the king of beasts, with his mane and charisma, roars three times, it can be heard as far as a league away
Then even ordinary lions present throughout that distance are frightened, let alone other, lesser kinds of wild animals
Even when the elephants in musth hear that sound, they urinate and defecate, and then disband, trumpeting loudly to one another
“Likewise, Ānanda, in the assembly of great lions, the assembly of those of venerable family, the assembly of the fearless, bodhisattvas who are unruly are included in name alone
Thus, for instance, when ordinary lions hear the lion’s roar, they feel compelled to hide in mountain fissures
Likewise, Ānanda, unruly bodhisattvas with poor conduct, who chase after renown, fame, and praise, and who revere the name, cadence, and sound of ‘self,’ will flee, frightened and scared, and thus fall off steep cliffs
This is because, Ānanda, bodhisattvas who engage in perceptions other than the words empty, signless , and wishless , and who are strongly attached to self, the aggregates, the elements, the sense sources, discipline, absorption, the path, nirvāṇa, the fruition, and the great nirvāṇa of a buddha’s awakening, will not be able to bear them. For
Ānanda, the words emptiness, signlessness , and wishlessness are words with magnitude
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches the Dharma, ‘All phenomena are empty,’ there is no emptiness whatsoever
there is no emptiness belonging to anything whatsoever
there is no emptiness of anything whatsoever, an
there is no emptiness in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches the Dharma, ‘All phenomena are signless,’ there is no signlessness whatsoever
there is no signlessness belonging to anything whatsoever
there is no signlessness with anything whatsoever, an
there is no signlessness in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches the Dharma, ‘All phenomena are wishless,’ there is nothing to be attained whatsoever
there is nothing to be attained of anything whatsoever
there is nothing to be attained by anyone whatsoever, an
there is nothing to be attained in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘the Dharma should be actualized,’ there is nothing to actualize whatsoever
there is nothing to actualize belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing to actualize by anyone whatsoever, an
there is nothing to actualize in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘the Dharma should be cultivated,’ there is nothing to cultivate whatsoever
there is nothing to cultivate belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing to cultivate by anyone whatsoever, an
there is nothing to cultivate in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘the Dharma should be developed,’ there is nothing to be developed whatsoever
there is nothing developed belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing to be developed by anyone whatsoever, an
there is nothing to be developed in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘phenomena are conditioned,’ there is nothing conditioned whatsoever
there is nothing conditioned belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing conditioned by anything whatsoever, an
there is nothing conditioned in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘phenomena are unconditioned,’ there is nothing unconditioned whatsoever
there is nothing unconditioned belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing unconditioned by anything whatsoever, an
there is nothing unconditioned in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘phenomena are afflicted,’ there is nothing afflicted whatsoever
there is nothing afflicted belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing afflicted by anything whatsoever, an
there is nothing afflicted in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, although the Thus-Gone One teaches that ‘phenomena are completely purified,’ there is nothing completely purified whatsoever
there is nothing completely purified belonging to anything whatsoever
there is nothing completely purified by anything whatsoever, an
there is nothing completely purified in anything whatsoever
“Ānanda, the seal of Dharma, the seal of all phenomena, is the absence of a seal
It is the unformed seal
It is the indivisible seal
Ānanda, anyone stamped with that seal is a bodhisattva great being
They are of venerable family
They are lions among humans
They are solitary
They are fearless
They proclaim the roar
They frighten other non-Buddhists
They subjugate the hordes of Māra
They cause other non-Buddhists to flee into caves in mountain fissures
They frighten those with reference points
They puncture and strike down those who are especially proud
They delight the offspring of buddhas that counteract Māra
They discern reality
They cause the victory banner of Dharma to be raised throughout the ten directions
They cause the drum of Dharma to be beaten
They cause the elixir of Dharma to be drunk
They satiate the heart-children of the victorious ones with well-spoken discourses
“Ānanda, it is like this, as a simile: When a lion, the king of beasts, emerges from his lair and proclaims a lion’s roar three times
all the lion cubs of venerable pedigree who hear the sound show themselves
Confident, fearless, joyous, and satiated, they look around throughout the four directions
Likewise, Ānanda, bodhisattva great beings who have embraced the altruistic intention, yet whose roots of virtue and faculties have not yet matured, and who are present in the assembly of lions—the assembly of those without trepidation, the assembly of those with great manes—are delighted and gleeful in the gathering of the great assembly upon hearing that sound
“Ānanda, it is also like this, as a simile: The lion, the king of beasts, only ever travels alone, without any companion, no matter where he goes
Likewise, Ānanda, the bodhisattva lions present in the assembly of the gathering of those audacious beings with manes /[F..a] always wear their armor without a companion, no matter where they go
They wear their armor in the absence of peers, thinking, ‘I will realize the qualities of the buddhas by myself. I will actualize the qualities of the buddhas without a companion.
“Ānanda, it is also like this, as a simile: The king of beasts dwells only in the womb of precisely its own kind. Moreover, the lion, the king of beasts, dwells only once in that womb
Likewise, Ānanda, bodhisattvas bound by only one rebirth dwell in the womb of the Great Vehicle, fo
they cannot be held by the vehicle of the hearers or the vehicle of the solitary buddhas
Thus, Ānanda, is the assembly an assembly of lions, an assembly of beings without trepidation, an assembly of beings with manes
“Ānanda, it is also like this, as a simile: Whether a lion, the king of beasts, is strong or weak
it strikes while completely focused, no matter which kind of creature it strikes. It does not do so unfocused
Likewise, Ānanda, no matter what Dharma discourse is delivered, all those bodhisattvas with manes who are present in the gathering of the lion assembly respectfully teach, retain, and promulgate that teaching and make others retain it
Ānanda, thus is this an assembly of lions, an assembly of those without trepidation.
This concludes the twelfth chapter
Then, the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati, who was seated in the assembly, rose from his seat, proffered his shawl, and said to the Blessed One
“I offer this garment to the Thus-Gone One as a Dharma covering to be offered to the awakened thus-gone ones of past, present, and future for the sake of eloquent explanations of this Dharma discourse, /[F..b] and so that bodhisattva great beings who have perfectly embarked on bodhisattva conduct will become replete with buddha qualities.
The bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati then offered his shawl to the Thus-Gone One
Next, he proffered another shawl and said
“Blessed One, I offer this garment to supplicate the Thus-Gone One for a Dharma discourse, which in the future may be heard from some Dharma preacher.
The bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati then went before the bodhisattva Guhagupta and said
“Brother, we should now offer that shawl to the Thus-Gone One in order to supplicate him.
The bodhisattvas Dṛḍhamati and Guhagupta then both offered the shawl to the Thus-Gone One, an
from that shawl there appeared many kinds of miraculous displays
The venerable Ānanda and the fourfold retinue all witnessed those miraculous displays
Seeing this, Ānanda exclaimed to the Thus-Gone One
“Blessed One, that is amazing
Blissful One, that is marvelous!
the Blessed One asked the venerable Ānanda, although he already knew how he would answer
“Why do you find it so amazing and marvelous?
The venerable Ānanda then replied in melodious verse
“Brought about through the miracles of the praises Of the valiant heroes who have set out for awakening, Here I witnessed several thousand emanations Emerge from the Dharma robes
“Savior of the world, I witnessed on that occasion More than a billion bodhisattvas Appearing from the Dharma robes, Themselves proffering Dharma robes
“They arrived here and offered them to the guides— The victors in the worlds throughout the ten directions— Thus demonstrating their supernatural powers
This is what I witnessed emerge today from the Dharma robes
“The savior of the world then predicted their supreme awakening. He said, ‘Whoever offers Dharma robes to the victorious ones Will, through practicing the conduct in stages, Become awakened.
“Pure parasols then appeared Above the crowns of the pure beings who went there
Other people thought, ‘As these beings practiced for the sake of awakening, Buddhas have now appeared here.
“Quadrillions of beings Arrived there, exclaiming sounds
Words of Dharma emerged from that, Such tha
the sounds of buddhas were heard from the sky
“I witnessed Jambudvīpa covered with buddhas
I witnessed the trichiliocosm covered with victorious ones
Guide, today I had a notion
I will henceforth not presume my body to be that of a hearer
“Teacher, Valiant One, such was your apparition
Today my eyes were shrouded, my mindfulness deluded, Bu
I will now see the wisdom of the noble ones
I will now see the three realms as entirely empty
“Knowing them to be empty, my mindfulness is undeluded
Those who have attained wisdom do not need eyes
Otherwise, Blessed One, it is only deluded mindfulness, Produced by making something visible before the eyes. “Valiant One, the retinue too is elated
They have levitated into the sky
Like a canopy, they are suspended on lotuses in the sky— Lotuses with a thousand petals
“All those present throughout the ten directions Emerged from the Dharma robe
Present was a vast saṅgha Of the sages of the world, guides, supreme victorious ones
“Valiant beings went forth there And bestowed inconceivable gifts
They relied on the guides for the sake of awakening
They went forth, working for the welfare of others
“Then, teaching the Dharma throughout the ten directions, The valiant appeared there as emanations
Savior of the world, those whom I saw come from the garment Were utterly beyond number or limit
“Seeing the worlds of the three realms appear from the garment
I was overjoyed and respectful
Just like the sovereign lord Brahmā, The beings were resplendent and adept in supernatural powers
“They were eloquent and widely learned
Then, having attained in all respects the gateways of retention
They turned the wheel in accordance with the manner of the victors
The fields were covered with Dharma robes
“They had beautiful chains made of various precious materials, While on some of the fields there was no color
Wherever the valiant came and walked
Supernatural powers were fully manifested in this world
“Adorned everywhere with flowers, incenses, perfumes, Banners, and streamers— I saw, Savior, the fields Where the valiant came and walked
“I saw buddhas dwelling on mounds of earth, And then I saw them turning the wheel of Dharma
Having seen those victorious ones and the miraculous displays
Such beings with supernatural powers came here from the garment
“Having emanated as bodies everywhere here, Wherever there are bodies in this worl
They teach the Dharma to benefit beings, And are resolute about that for the sake of awakening
“Amazing things have perfectly transpired here today
Those who have seen them have conviction
The skilled Victorious One has observed the awakened manifestation
Such was the miraculous display, Blessed One
“Blessed One, as the vast field for people, You are the sublime teacher of all guests
Blessed One, for the myriad beings who face pleasure and pain, You will have produced a great effect
“Even were I to give voice to praises for eons
I could not finish even in a thousand eons
For whose benefit did the sage demonstrate The supernatural powers that were produced from the garment
“Whose vast field will it be
Who will have such immeasurable supernatural powers, When practicing the conduct of awakening here
Guide, I beseech you to clarify this for me today
“How is it that lotuses the size of chariot wheels Adorn it in various colors
How is it that many bodhisattvas have come And pay homage to the buddhas in the ten directions
“After paying homage they will return to that realm
As they then return to that place, they will attain awakening
That vast realm will be purified
Inconceivable supernatural powers will be present
“Those practicing bodhisattva conduct will also be seen
In this buddha realm there will be a single hero. How will those who proffer to him the Dharma robes, Train in this by means of no training
“Previously I dedicated my practice of generosity, saying, ‘May the appropriate and sought-after enjoyments given as alms, By which all beings experience happiness, Benefit all beings!
“Savior, please tell me the significance
Savior of the world, resolve my doubt
Was such an aspiration Dṛḍhamati’s, Or was it the monk Guhagupta’s?
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, as the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati wishes to ask a question, wait briefly while I answer his question, and I will then answer yours.
The bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati then said to the Blessed One
“If, in order to clarify some questions, the Blessed One would allow me the opportunity
I would like to ask the Blessed One about some points.
said the Blessed One to the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati
“Dṛḍhamati, ask whichever questions you wish an
I will please your mind with fitting responses,
The bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what is meant by entering the gateway 
Blessed One, could the Thus-Gone One please explain that
Please explain as well about bodhisattvas who have entered the words of the gateway, and also about entering into those teachings
“What are those supreme teachings
How are they entered
What kind of gateway do they have
Guide, please explain accordingly
“How, upon entering the Dharma, Will awakening arise
How, upon teaching the Dharma, Will one’s eloquence become unimpeded
“Where do those qualities come from
Where do they abide
How do we become undeluded about them And apply mindfulness to those qualities
“By all means please explain the nature of the practice Of those who will enter
Please explain the actualization of the qualities Of those who have so entered
“How will we become undeluded about them And gain mindfulness of the Dharma, O Guide, So that eloquence becomes unimpeded For eons beyond number
“How should we perceive them
What kind of support do they have
What is the means by which Their preaching will never end, O Guide
“How did those of the past Practice generosity and dedicate it toward peace
By what means will we engender and encounter The eloquence of the charismatic
“How have they observed discipline
How have they relied upon discipline
How have they dedicated discipline
Which ones did not follow precepts
“How have they cultivated patience
How have they relied upon patience
By what means did they achieve The unexcelled limit of the unborn
“How have they applied diligence
How have they relied on diligence
By what means have they Not parted from the awakening of the buddhas, O Guide
“How have they generated concentration
How have they relied on concentration
Upon which phenomena have they concentrated
By what means have they engendered eloquence
“How have they cultivated insight
How have they relied on insight
How do they engage wisdom
How does their eloquence become uninterrupted? “Who abides by the unexcelled way? Who teaches the authentic Dharma? Who approaches the awakening Of emptiness, profound and peaceful
“How have they received the various sūtras? How have they ascertained their various contents? How have they taught them again and again
Please answer these questions
“Resolve the doubts of beings
I request that of the teacher
In the future Dharma preachers will appear
“How will they abide by the teachings
How, O Guide, having abided by the Dharma, And having received it, Will they uphold the Dharma
“Savior of the world, best of humans, Teach me about the questions I have posed
How in the future Will you resolve the doubts of beings?
replied the Blessed One to the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati
“Dṛḍhamati, excellent!” “It is excellent that you thought to ask the Thus-Gone One about those topics
In the same way you have also formed roots of virtue before previous thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas, an
you also put questions to those thus-gone ones
Dṛḍhamati, I remember countless eons ago, on this very spot of earth, your putting the same questions to sixty-eight thousand buddhas; and as you put them to all those thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas, it came to be of benefit to immeasurably many beings
“Therefore, Dṛḍhamati, with that in mind you should understand the following
Dṛḍhamati, countless eons ago there appeared in the world a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha called Jewel of Exalted Light
That thus-gone one’s lifespan was half an eon
That blessed one had a retinue of seven hundred million worthy ones who had exhausted the defilements. Together with them he would wander the countryside and observe the summer rains retreats
Dṛḍhamati, at that time that Jambudvīpa was broad and vast, extending across seven billion leagues
There was a universal monarch then called Lord of Irreproachable Merit. He was a coronated king of royal caste, who as a righteous Dharma king with sovereignty over the world of the four continents guarded his dominion over the four borders
The Jambudvīpa of that time had eight hundred million large and vast cities, which were each forty by thirty leagues in size. They were all wealthy, healthy, happy, abundant in food, pleasant, and well populated
“Dṛḍhamati, at the center of King Lord of Irreproachable Merit’s Jambudvīpa was a huge royal palace where the king resided. The palace was eighty leagues in circumference and checkered in design, with each square a half league in width
Dṛḍhamati, that royal palace was called Sukhāvatī 
The royal palace had seventy thousand surrounding gardens that were without owner or proprietor so that beings could enjoy them
Dṛḍhamati, there was one large garden that was as big as King Lord of Irreproachable Merit’s eighty-league royal palace
That large garden was surrounded all around by seven rows of palm trees, seven layers of lattices with tiny bells, seven layers of courtyards, seven walls, and seven moats
“Dṛḍhamati, at that time the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light gradually wandered through the area with his large monastic assembly comprised of seven hundred million worthy ones, and eventually they arrived at the royal palace
Dṛḍhamati, King Lord of Irreproachable Merit heard that the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Jewel of Exalted Light had been wandering through the land with his seven hundred million monks and that they had now arrived at the royal palace and taken up residence in the garden of the royal palace
So, Dṛḍhamati, the king went before the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light, prostrated to the Blessed One’s feet, and sat to one side
Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Jewel of Exalted Light understood the king’s intention and s
he fully taught him a Dharma discourse of the Bodhisattva Collection, which resolves the doubts of all beings
Upon hearing it, the king experienced joy and happiness and became elated and enraptured, so that he thought to himself
‘I should most certainly offer my own exquisitely adorned garden for the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light to enjoy.
With this thought, the king offered the garden for the Thus-Gone One to enjoy
The king also commissioned seven hundred million rest houses, seven hundred million promenades, and seven hundred million seats
Having also offered seven hundred million parks, together with attendants
he went before the Blessed One and asked
‘Out of loving kindness for me, will the Blessed One please deign to come for a meal tomorrow with the assembly of monks?
“Dṛḍhamati, since the Blessed One remained silent, the king understood that he had acquiesced
Having prostrated to his feet and taken his leave
that night the king ordered the preparation of an abundance of the finest delicacies, fit to be the meal of a universal monarch
“After the night had passed, he went before the Blessed One and made the request for mealtime
Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Jewel of Exalted Light then donned his lower garment and Dharma robes that morning
Carrying his alms bowl, and escorted by the assembly of monks
he went to the palace of King Lord of Irreproachable Merit
Arriving, he sat down on the cushion set out for him
The monks too sat down on their cushions as arranged
Understanding that the Blessed One was seated and that the assembly of monks too were seated
the king respectfully served the meal of abundant delicacies with his own hands, thus satisfying everyone
When he had respectfully served and satisfied the Blessed One with that meal served by his own hands
the king noticed that the Blessed One had finished eating and that his hands and bowl were now hidden
The king then offered three Dharma robes for the body of the Blessed One and each monk in the assembly
“Dṛḍhamati, after having clothed the bodies of the Blessed One and the assembly of monks, the king approached the Blessed One carrying a golden vase, washed the Blessed One’s hands, and said
‘Blessed One, I offer this garden, these rest houses, these promenades, these bedding articles, these seats, and these groves to the Blessed One
To serve and attend you, I also offer myself.
“Dṛḍhamati, thereafter the king continued to serve and attend upon the Thus-Gone One, respectfully following him, just like the first day, in order to listen to the Dharma
Dṛḍhamati, thus serving that blessed one for half an eon, King Lord of Irreproachable Merit also asked the Thus-Gone One all about what is tenable and what is not
Asking him all about such things, the Blessed One offered his response in return, and thereby brought benefit to immeasurable, countless beings
“Dṛḍhamati, if you have any doubt or hesitation, thinking that the king who was then called Lord of Irreproachable Merit was someone else
you should not see it like that
This is because, Dṛḍhamati, the king called Lord of Irreproachable Merit was none other than you
Dṛḍhamati, I remember that in the past there were a full thousand buddhas whom you provided with unexcelled service and attendance in order to ask about this Dharma discourse
Dṛḍhamati, I will now teach you regarding your questions on how to accomplish the gateway of Dharma, and how the gateway of Dharma is accomplished
“Dṛḍhamati, the gateways of Dharma are bases and foundations, bu
they are devoid of thinking, devoid of characteristics, devoid of effort, pure, completely pure, utterly pure, inexpressible, devoid of syllables, the inverse of syllables, and undemonstrable
Dṛḍhamati, phenomena neither appear, nor are they knowable by cognition
Dṛḍhamati, gateways of Dharma are the deeds by which the thus-gone ones fully understand nirvāṇa, for how they fully understand it, and the means by which they fully understand. They cannot be known by me
Dṛḍhamati, those phenomena are to be neither known nor designated
At the same time, Dṛḍhamati, all the designated paths are the gateways of Dharma
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are of the same flavor, they bear the seal of the ocean
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have the inexhaustible as their boundary and limit, their end is not known
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are neither completed nor diminished, they are an inexhaustibility
That is why the thus-gone ones designate, teach, and establish the accomplishment of the gateway beyond exhaustion
“All phenomena possess the gate of a , fo
the entrance into a is a point of explanation for designating the gate devoid of attributes
Accomplishing it is to join with it
The syllables joined with it have not formed a 
That is why the Dharma is called a 
It is made known through a , an
that knowledge, moreover, is made complete in conjunction with the syllables and words joined with it
Therefore, the thus-gone ones have taught that ‘all phenomena possess a as their gateway.
“What are the phenomena to which that gateway belongs
Dṛḍhamati, those phenomena are unformed
Since the unformed is unknown, they are known without being designated and known, expressed without being expressible, elucidated without being elucidatable, and exhausted without knowing exhaustion
Dṛḍhamati, thus does a perform the function of all phenomena
The gateway though which noble sons and daughters enter to gain wisdom and eloquence beyond exhaustion is the gateway called a
“Dṛḍhamati, inexhaustible means beyond exhaustion
Dṛḍhamati, that which is devoid of designation and knowing is inexhaustible
Those that are made known without being known are not made known, and those that are designated are not designated
thus, Dṛḍhamati, is that gateway called inexhaustible
“To what does that gateway belong
It is the gateway of those phenomena
Of which ones
Those that are neither found, nor perceived by the thus-gone ones
“Dṛḍhamati, gateway means irreversible, fo
that entrance is into all phenomena
All that is elucidated is unelucidatable
All speech is speech of the inexhaustible
All speech is the speech of precisely that, and no other
All that is known is not known, an
this, Dṛḍhamati, is a vajra statement
Why is it called a vajra statement 
Because it is never divisible, and being utterly indivisible, it is devoid of any agent
Thus lacking any agent whatsoever, it is called a vajra statement
“All phenomena are devoid of action
Where there is no action there is also absolutely no maturation
Since they thus lack any maturation at all, all phenomena are therefore said to be devoid of action and devoid of maturation
Regarding the seal of the Dharma, when thus-gone ones teach the maturation of actions with respect to certain things, this is taught through the seal of the Dharma
That seal should be understood as unformed and undivided
Dṛḍhamati, noble sons and daughters who wish to engage in the maturation of actions should thus engage in it
“Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena emerge in space, they are beyond coming and going
Dṛḍhamati, it is based on that gateway that thus-gone ones fully know the deaths and births of beings
Dṛḍhamati, noble sons and daughters who wish to penetrate death and birth should enter that seal
Dṛḍhamati, this is the seal of the absence of syllables and the absence of designation of any phenomena
Dṛḍhamati, the full range of everything verbally elucidated by the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas is elucidated by that seal and also elucidates that very same seal
“Dṛḍhamati, all ordinary bodies are the awakened body of a thus-gone one
This is because that awakened body is the awakened body of ordinary bodies, and a thus-gone one demonstrates the formation of beings’ ordinary bodies by means of that seal
Dṛḍhamati, the seal by which the ordinary body is sealed is the designation of all ordinary bodies
Dṛḍhamati, everyone whose body is formed is sealed by that seal, an
a thus-gone one has accomplished that very same seal
“Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have no entrance, they have no gateway
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have no going, they have no entrance
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have no entrance, they have no going
“Dṛḍhamati, however the thus-gone ones teach the Dharma, they teach only those who are of the unobstructed nature and they also know full well that that very same nature belongs to all beings, for their nature is like that
Dṛḍhamati, the so-called unobstructed nature refers to the nature of the infinite
Since all beings are taught to be of that empty nature, they possess just such a nature
“Dṛḍhamati, with that gateway of the nature being the gateway of all phenomena, everything that is the gateway of the nature comprises the aggregate of phenomena. However
the aggregate of phenomena also lacks an aggregate
With those aggregates thus lacking aggregates, those aggregates too are aggregates of phenomena
Dṛḍhamati, from whichever perspective the thus-gone ones teach the aggregates, they teach this topic through that threshold of the aggregate of phenomena
The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are without aggregates
This is taught as the gateway to the attributes of the aggregates.
The bodhisattva great being Dṛḍhamati then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, that entrance to phenomena is profound.
replied the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “the thus-gone ones do not think, ‘This is profound. This is lucid.
Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone ones only teach a little.
offered Dṛḍhamati
“They do not teach according to what is apprehended by the immature,” “Rather, they teach according to what is known by the wise
That is how the thus-gone ones teach the Dharma.
countered the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “the thus-gone ones do not teach, designate, or posit in accordance with their complete understanding
This is because, Dṛḍhamati, while all phenomena are fully known by the wise, the knowledge of syllables accords with how the immature apprehend. Moreover, since those syllables are also devoid of syllables, there is no teaching.
The Blessed One then continued what he was saying to Dṛḍhamati
“Dṛḍhamati, all phenomena are the light of the orb of the sun
Dṛḍhamati, from whichever perspective phenomena are perfectly discerned, they appear to exclusively possess the nature of the infinite
It is in this sense that they are the light of the Dharma
“Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are fully illuminated and free of obstruction, they are luminous
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are unobstructed by anything whatsoever, they have no obstruction
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are like open space, they are unobstructed
Dṛḍhamati, the unobstructed vision of the thus-gone ones penetrates wherever there is dualistic designation and dualistic apprehending
Dṛḍhamati, this unobstructed perfect knowing, in which the thus-gone ones perfectly know all phenomena through their vision, is the Dharma of vision
“Dṛḍhamati, through the gateway of all phenomena emerge expressions that cause noble sons to discern the meaning, expressions based on which they teach the profound, and expressions that are unimpeded. This is also the unobstructed gateway.
the Blessed One continued to explain to the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati
“Dṛḍhamati,” “since all phenomena are without impediment and free of impediment, they are free of stains
Dṛḍhamati, being without benefit, all phenomena are devoid of being received
Dṛḍhamati, since no phenomenon can be apprehended as an object, all phenomena are infinite and boundless
Dṛḍhamati, wherever a teaching with syllables is taught, all that is taught there is that all phenomena are devoid of syllables
Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are without boundary and are taught to be without boundary, whenever someone enters the gateway beyond syllables, this is their entrance
That entrance is not an entrance into any phenomena whatsoever
“Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone ones have taught on the accomplishment of the gateway of absorption
What is the accomplishment of absorption
Dṛḍhamati, there is an absorption called array of all phenomena in a single mode 
And there is an absorption called multiple array
“What, then, is the absorption called the single array 
Dṛḍhamati, this is when bodhisattva great beings proclaim the name of a single thus-gone one by saying, ‘Such-and-such thus-gone one is teaching the Dharma in such-and-such world system.
Hearing the name of that thus-gone one causes them to apprehend the thus-gone one in terms of his features, to aspire to such features themselves, and to actualize them
They bring to mind—with undistracted recollection, unperturbed faculties, and non-distracted attention—only the thus-gone one, either seated on the supreme seat of awakening, or fully awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, or turning the wheel of Dharma, or surrounded by an assembly of hearers, or teaching the Dharma
By recollecting the name of that thus-gone one they bring before themselves the perception of his world system
Moreover, it also makes them understand their perception of the thus-gone one and his world system as exclusively perceived by way of non-apprehending
By adhering to that and not discarding that connection, the awakened body of a thus-gone one will be actualized
By bringing to mind the teaching of the Dharma, they also bring it before themselves by means of the profound, the lucid, meanings, and syllables, precisely how they are inclined toward it
Abiding in that absorption, they are motivated by the perishability of all things to listen to the Dharma taught by the thus-gone one
They are motivated to receive and uphold all those teachings that are taught
Having received and upheld them
they rise from that absorption and teach the fourfold retinue
That engagement and that perception are, in this vein, the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array
“Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas also destroy that very perception and destroy their own body too
The perishability of all things inducts them into the absorption of the single array 
Rising from that, they are also led to teach the Dharma to the fourfold retinue
Dṛḍhamati, this too is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array
“Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas are led to analyze that very perception of the thus-gone one’s awakened body by thinking, ‘Where did the thus-gone one’s awakened body come from, and where have I gone?
Thus they understand perfectly that the thus-gone one has not arrived and that they themselves have not departed
They then think, ‘All phenomena are beyond coming and going.
Through abiding by and striving in such analysis
they obtain before long the unobscured vision of Dharma
Upon obtaining the unobscured vision of Dharma
they are a thus-gone one, fo
they have actualized the gateway of Dharma through which unimpeded eloquence is obtained
They teach the Dharma, yet they do not truly see those phenomena
“Dṛḍhamati, it is like this, for example: Even while a thus-gone one’s unimpeded wisdom partakes of the past
a thus-gone one’s wisdom also has no impediment with respect to bodies
A thus-gone one’s wisdom does not partake of the past by means of apprehending
Even though a thus-gone one’s wisdom does not partake of the past
the wisdom of a thus-gone one still masters the past. However, with respect to the past, it does not follow after any bodies as observed by a thus-gone one
The same also goes for the future and the present
Dṛḍhamati, it is in this manner that while abiding in the absorption of the single array , bodhisattvas teach the Dharma, althoug
they do not even truly see those phenomena
“Abiding in that absorption through having strongly cultivated it causes them to bring to mind, perceive, and manifest before themselves a second thus-gone one, either coming to reside in some world system and sitting down at the seat of awakening, or fully awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, or turning the wheel of Dharma, or teaching the Dharma
They thus also receive and uphold the Dharma taught by that thus-gone one
While perceiving the previously perceived thus-gone one
they do not discard this perception of a second thus-gone one
They thus perceive and actualize both thus-gone ones teaching the Dharma
Dṛḍhamati, this too is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array
“Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, once bodhisattvas have retained well and imagined well, to the point of great mastery, one perception of a thus-gone one
they can then bring to mind as many thus-gone ones as they wish
Dṛḍhamati, it is just like how a masterful monk can bring to mind the perception of the physical sense sources as being blue
He can imagine all of them, everything whatsoever, as only blue, such tha
no perception of them manifests in any other way apart from blue
He imagines and transforms all beings into only blue, manifesting them as only blue
He perceives all internal and external phenomena with the thought that they are blue and he also gains mastery in that
Dṛḍhamati, in the same way do bodhisattvas bring to mind the various world systems in which they have heard that myriad thus-gone ones reside, as well as the thus-gone ones themselves
“Through bringing to mind a perception of thus-gone ones that is well imagined and well ascertained, they transform all beings and name them ‘thus-gone ones, buddhas, self-arisen ones.
By bringing to mind a mentally created perception of thus-gone ones, all perceptions are transformed by them into a single perception in which only thus-gone ones manifest
They do not see anything at all that is not perceived as thus-gone ones, or exclusively as buddhas
Dṛḍhamati, this too is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array .
asked Dṛḍhamati
“Blessed One, what is the accomplishment of that absorption?
said the Blessed One
“It is that the one-pointed mental perception of all thus-gone ones is not discarded,
“That, Dṛḍhamati, is accomplishing the absorption of the single array 
Dṛḍhamati, that all phenomena are understood with a single perception is also the nature of everything
this, Dṛḍhamati, is called the absorption of the single array 
Bodhisattvas, while abiding in that absorption, think, ‘All speech is the speech of the thus-gone ones; all bodies are the bodies of the thus-gone ones.’ Such is their practice and belief
“Moreover, Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas proclaim the names of two, three, four, five, ten—up to one hundred, and up to one hundred thousand—thus-gone ones, manifesting and bringing them all to mind simultaneously
They also manifest and bring to mind all the arrays of buddha realms and arrays of hearers belonging to those thus-gone ones
They also manifest, bring to mind, and bring forth the perfect forms, perfect characteristics, perfect complexions, perfect bodies, and perfect proportions belonging to those thus-gone ones
They apprehend the characteristics of each of the traits of a great being
They apprehend the characteristics of walking without delusion, having the gait of a lion, the invisible crown protuberance, and the full fathom of light enveloping him
They also transform that full fathom of light, imagining it to be infinite light
They perfectly cognize the infinity of light and apprehend an infinity of buddha realms
They also transform, bring to mind, and perfectly cognize immeasurable arrays of buddha realms, whil
they also fully comprehend, bring to mind, and transform an infinite array of hearers
“Moreover, they analyze by thinking, ‘Where did the thus-gone ones come from, and where have I gone?’ Being immersed in this thought, they are brought to the belief that the thus-gone ones and they themselves are beyond coming or going
They then think
‘There is no phenomenon whatsoever called thus-gone one an
there is no phenomenon whatsoever called self .
They continue to analyze, thinking, ‘All phenomena are the same.
Through analyzing thus, they come to the belief that all phenomena are identical in characteristic
As they engage in, believe in, and perfectly understand the thought, ‘All phenomena are characterized by the characteristic of being unformed,’ they thus transform phenomena
They thus perceive all phenomena as having a single characteristic by way of being without characteristics
“Dṛḍhamati, however many buddhas are accomplished, the one-pointed state of mind remains, for
Dṛḍhamati, this is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array 
This accomplishment in which everything has the single characteristic of being buddhas, yet also has no characteristics, is known as the absorption of the single array 
While abiding in that absorption, one does not have the thought, ‘This is not a thus-gone one.
One does not have the thought, ‘This is not a phenomenon.
One does not have the thought, ‘This is not a hearer.
Nor does one perceive or think, ‘hearer.
One does not have the thought, ‘The Dharma is not taught.
Nor does one perceive the Dharma being taught
One does not have the thought, ‘This is not perceived,
nor does one perceive perception
One does not have the thought, ‘It is not a buddha realm,
nor does one perceive buddha realms
One does not have the thought, ‘It is not the retinue,
nor does one perceive the retinue
One does not have the thought, ‘It is not eloquence,
nor does one perceive eloquence
One does not have the thought, ‘This is not expression,
nor does one perceive expression
One does not have the thought, ‘This is not transforming,
nor does one perceive anything transformed
There is nothing at all that one does not believe
nor does one perceive any belief
There is no absence of thinking at all
nor does one perceive any thinking
There is no absence of cultivation at all
nor does one perceive cultivation
There is no absence of discernment at all
nor does one perceive discernment
There is no absence of clarification at all
nor does one perceive clarification
There is nothing at all that one does not teach
nor does one perceive teaching
Dṛḍhamati, this is called the accomplishment of the absorption of all phenomena seen by the unobstructed wisdom of bodhisattvas 
The very absence of visual impediment is called unimpededness 
That which perceives such phenomena is called the vision of Dharma 
Absorption is that by which bodhisattvas attain infinite eloquence.
The bodhisattva great being Dṛḍhamati then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, in the future there will appear myriad bodhisattva great beings who enter attainment in that absorption, reach perfection through that absorption, and thereby also attain infinite eloquence.
replied the Blessed One
“Dṛḍhamati,” “you should understand that, in the future, during the time of the final five hundred years, the bodhisattvas who have learned of that meditative absorption will reach perfection through that absorption and its limit will be the infinite eloquence of those monks
Dṛḍhamati, regarding your statement, ‘There will appear myriad beings who will reach perfection through that absorption,’ Dṛḍhamati, those who cultivate that absorption, repeating it frequently without thinking about anything else, will reach perfection through that absorption and also attain infinite eloquence, attaining eight hundred thousand gateways of Dharma from the thus-gone one Akṣobhya in order to actualize that infinity of eloquence
Hence, Dṛḍhamati, these are expressions connected to one gateway
Dṛḍhamati, the gateways of Dharma in their entirety are expressions that distinguish between the levels
This is why, Dṛḍhamati, that gateway should by all means be comprehended
It should by all means be entered
It should by all means be cultivated
Explaining it based on its characteristics should be cultivated constantly
Apprehending it, moreover, should likewise be cultivated
This singular action is the body of the Buddha
“The awakening of the buddhas is imagined by mind
Mind too is formless and pure by nature
Those who adhere extensively to apprehending Will engage in each and every apprehension
“Having discerned the parameters of mind
They will know, with regard to apprehending, that all these phenomena Have likewise emerged from thought
Wherever no thoughts arise is a gateway
“They will know the changing nature of mind, An
they will likewise know apprehending itself
They will perfectly know that all these beings are essenceless, An
through perfectly knowing that, their mindfulness will not be obscured
“Through thus perfectly knowing the Dharma
They will emanate many buddha bodies
They will not be attached in the slightest to those bodies, And will likewise know beings to be empty
“Grasping the characteristics of apprehending, They will witness the transformations of mind and body
Therefore, by urgently cultivating that absorption
Their knowledge will thus partake of the Dharma
“In teaching the Dharma, they will manifest forms
When teaching the Dharma, they will not be deluded
They will develop virtue in people, Who will also obtain the Dharma before long.
This concludes the thirteenth chapter
“Dṛḍhamati, if you have four qualities
they will enable you to accomplish that absorption and teach it to others
What are those four qualities
Apply diligence to attain that absorption and do not discard your efforts
When seated, enthusiastically preaching day and night, manifest the thus-gone ones seated at the supreme seat of awakening, or turning the wheel of Dharma, and likewise have no stinginess with Dharma
While giving the gift of Dharma, transform yourself and the audience members for the Dharma into the bodies of thus-one ones
for while one’s own body will be destroyed, those bodies do not abide anywhere at all, and teach the Dharma while not abiding anywhere
One should sit on the cushion observing that, with that kind of experience, and effecting that kind of transformation, and while seated in this manner, one should give the gift of Dharma
“One will thus attain that absorption
Dṛḍhamati. Some will attain it while giving the gift of Dharma
For some it will be afterward
For some it will be while composing
“Dṛḍhamati, one should connect with that absorption by having four other qualities
What are these four qualities
That such bodhisattvas have gone forth from their household
That they sleep in peripheral areas, delighting in forests and wildernesses
That they give oral advice and instructions in accordance with the audience, in view of those who engage in the conduct of beings
Such bodhisattvas also know perfectly well the conduct that accords with their inclinations
“Dṛḍhamati, those who have four other qualities should be known as spiritual friends
What are those four qualities
They are in possession of expressions that defeat others
They connect beings with the profound Dharma
They are in possession of timely expressions of oral advice
And they let go of those instructions when the time is right
Those who possess those four other qualities should be known as spiritual friends.
In that regard, the Blessed One then said the following
“Perfectly knowing place and region, An
perfectly knowing people too
Spiritual friends dispense to them oral instructions Through which they will swiftly emerge
“Spiritual friends speak defeating expressions to beings, And also connect them with the profound
They instruct them in a timely fashion, And let go of those instructions when the time is right
“Whichever turns of phrase spiritual friends have spoken, Even while conversing intensively
They have no fixation upon them, And thus let go of them when the time is right
“Dṛḍhamati, those in possession of four qualities should be known as spiritual friends
What are those four qualities
Dṛḍhamati, spiritual friends cause beings to connect with going forth. They cause them to connect with the intention to ascertain the profound meaning
They cause beings to connect with non-attachment toward any focal point in concentration
They also cause beings to connect with the perception of the absence of characteristics
These are the four.
The Blessed One then said the following about this
“They should cause beings to connect With isolated forests and going forth
Speaking always in praise of that— Such are spiritual friends
“They should connect beings with teachings ascertained as profound, According to their ultimate meaning, An
they should not be devoid of concentrations
Those are sublime spiritual friends
“Dṛḍhamati, there are four qualities which, if bodhisattvas possess them, enable them to cultivate that absorption
What are those four qualities
Having discarded their own intellect
bodhisattvas should be moved according to the intellect of the master
They should apply diligence uninterruptedly
They should not discard diligence and should delight in forests and wildernesses
They should fully abandon all social interactions
Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas who have these four qualities will be able to attain that absorption
“Dṛḍhamati, there are four other qualities which, if bodhisattvas possess them, enable them to attain that absorption
What are those four qualities
In perceiving thus-gone ones that they uphold well, they do not abandon the thus-gone ones even while so much as dreaming of them
In perceiving Dharma teachings that they uphold well, they do not discard the perception of the Dharma teachings even while so much as dreaming of them, and neither are they apathetic about Dharma teachings
Through the perishability of all things, they also acquire acceptance of the profound Dharma
Through practicing disengagement, they are also those who practice the concentration of non-abiding
Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas who have those four qualities will be able to attain that absorption.
About this, the Blessed One then said
“If a spiritual friend Should instruct in accordance with this, The path traversed by the buddhas, It should not be abandoned, I say
“Dṛḍhamati, those who possess four qualities should be known as spiritual friends
What are those four qualities
They connect beings with virtue
They turn them away from wickedness
They bring them to the Dharma
And they give teachings appropriate to them
Those are the four.
The Blessed One then said
“Bodhisattvas should always rely on spiritual friends
They should rely on such supreme persons, Who turn beings away from wicked qualities, And teach the Dharma given by the victorious ones
“The heroes from whom the Dharma originates Dispense appropriate oral instructions
They abide by the Dharma, precisely as it is taught, An
based on abiding by the Dharma, they progress
“They rely upon the teachings that should be relied upon
They know the teachings that should be relied upon
Having also abandoned what should be abandoned
They rely on the teachings given by the victorious ones
“Bodhisattvas who want eloquence In order to teach from their own knowledge Should quickly cultivate that absorption And follow a spiritual friend
“They should renounce entirely, precisely as taught, But should not discard any phenomena whatsoever
They should teach for the sake of benefiting Precisely those who will receive the Dharma
“They should accomplish their wishes in all respects, But should certainly not teach moved by them
Bodhisattvas should seek such teachings In reliance always upon a spiritual friend
“Therefore, bodhisattvas should rely upon spiritual friends
They should abandon wicked companions
They will become learned based on spiritual friends, An
based on them, they will also quickly attain that absorption
“Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas should rely upon spiritual friends with four qualities
What are those four qualities
They fully know the oral instructions
They fully know their cultivation
They fully know the faults with oral instructions
And they fully know the faults with their cultivation
Those are the four.
About this, the Blessed One then said
“They know oral instructions, and likewise, cultivation
They also fully know the faults with cultivation, And the faults with oral instructions, And thus connect beings with the faultless Dharma
“Dṛḍhamati, those with four qualities should be known as spiritual friends
What are those four qualities
They fully know place
They fully know location
They fully know persons
And they fully know conduct
“How is it that they fully know place
They fully and precisely know place in accordance with persons
How is it that they fully know persons
They fully and precisely know what persons will become based on their conduct
How is it that they fully know conduct
They decisively demonstrate engagement in Dharma teachings in accordance with desirous, hateful, and delusional conduct. Thereby, in order to abandon desire, they enthusiastically embrace the three Dharma robes and go forth, do not associate with householders, abandon argumentation, accept the profound, and experience emptiness
Dṛḍhamati, those with those four qualities should be known as spiritual friends who will attain that absorption
“Dṛḍhamati, there are four qualities that, if householder bodhisattvas possess them, enable them to attain that absorption and strive in that absorption
What are those four qualities
Dṛḍhamati, householder bodhisattvas should observe the five precepts
They should also stay in a monastic rest house, taking only one meal a day
They should become highly learned
They should become adept at ascertaining the meaning and rely upon spiritual friends who instruct while abiding in that absorption
Dṛḍhamati, if householder bodhisattvas have those four qualities, they should apply themselves to attaining that absorption
“Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas should apply themselves to it by having four other qualities
What are those four qualities
In order to bring about the attainment of that meditative concentration through not dwelling on any phenomenon, they should have a pristine practice of discipline, a pristine livelihood, and disregard their life and limb without any remorse
They should form the notion that the one from whom they listen to the Dharma is the teacher
They should manifest the body of the thus-gone ones
They should also be free of stinginess
“Dṛḍhamati, the following four qualities help those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle to attain that absorption
With regard to the body, they should not examine the body with any concepts involving a body to be observed
With regard to feelings, they should not examine feelings with any concepts involving feelings to be observed
With regard to the mind, they should not examine the mind with any concepts involving a mind to be observed
With regard to phenomena, they should not examine phenomena with any concepts involving phenomena to be observed
Dṛḍhamati, those four qualities help those who have perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle to attain that absorption.
About this, the Blessed One then said
“They cultivate the applications of mindfulness, Which I have always praised
With the experience of a monk They will attain such an absorption
“They meditate on the body as impermanent, Yet do not dwell on the body
With a mind that does not dwell, They will attain such an absorption
“They have no miserliness about Dharma in their pursuit of the teachings On the four bases of supernatural powers and the four genuine discernments
While observing discipline, they rely upon sublime friends
Seeking that absorption, they cultivate the idea of the teacher
“That is the family of abundant wholesomeness
That is the source of learning
It likewise dispels Māra, And connects one with that absorption
“That is the supreme among their visions, The unexcelled vision of Dharma
By teaching the Dharma, No one at all will be obscured
“That is the scripture of the sūtras, And the scripture of the highly learned
From it came my awakening
One should therefore rely upon it
“The ten powers and the four authentic discernments, Which I have taught, All appeared from this
One should therefore rely upon it
“The buddhas have taught the absorption That yields accomplishment and transformation
That eloquence cannot be exhausted Through teaching
“It has no depletion And no completion
Through fully discerning it
They will become as immovable as the ocean
“Since I have explained the absorption That they will attain
They will not behold the face Of anyone at all teaching it later
“It has also been explained By gods, nāgas, kiṃnaras, humans, and nonhumans, So they behold their faces, And will behold many of them
“That is the source from which Those who have taught it attained it
Just as they trained in it
Just as they were exalted in Dharma
“Through teaching that sūtra Their intentions will be known
Through training in that absorption, The conduct of beings will be known
“Stabilize your mind in this sūtra An
you will know the names Of all the buddhas that I have taught, And their teachings too
“Observing me, They will fully know All the myriad sūtras That were taught throughout the realms of the world
“Abiding in that absorption, They will fully know All the respected hearers That the saviors of the world have had
“They will fully know the buddha realms Just as they are arrayed
Whoever cultivates such absorptions Will also know their life spans
“They will fully know the days that have passed, The fortnights, the months, Complete years as well, And eons too
“They will fully know the best of men, The fully awakened ones, In the worlds throughout the ten directions, An
they will know all realms
“Those who cultivate absorption Will fully know All the names of the saviors of the world, Which were taught by the teacher
“They will fully know the sūtras, Which were taught by the protector
They will know the myriad excellent hearers And saviors of the world
“Whoever attains this absorption Will become stable in intelligence
They will also here know What the experience of buddhas is
“They will fully know All the future buddhas, Who will appear over the course of ten million eons, And what their names and family lineages will be
“They will know their life spans, And their hearers too
They will also know the sūtras, Which will be explained by the protectors
“What their buddha realms are like, How they are arrayed, And how long the Dharma Of buddhas passed away will remain— “While abiding in absorption, They will know all those things
Therefore, whoever wants to be highly learned Should rely on it
“By relying upon that absorption, They will know its meaning too
As that is the gate for entering the wisdom of awakening, Their intelligence will be stabilized
“The meaning will emerge from it, An
they will enter the wisdom of awakening
From it they will attain Merit without limit
“They will fully know as many buddhas As will appear— Fully awakened ones, Saviors of the world, the best of men
“Those who have embarked upon awakening Will worship The myriad hearers Of each and every buddha
“For the sake of offering To each and every buddha, They will fill no fewer than a billion worlds With accumulated wealth
“By that estimation, They will serve all buddhas, Victorious ones with their hearers, Until the eon is completely finished
“Future buddhas, Highly renowned saviors of the world, Will also manifest for them As they make such offerings
“Such abundant heaps of merit Will also endow them with stable intelligence
It will compel them to pursue the ultimate wisdom, The inconceivable wisdom of awakening
“Whoever seeks awakening, Should cultivate this absorption
Whoever has cultivated this absorption Will be exalted in learning
“For whoever has cultivated this absorption And for whoever will cultivate it, I cannot say that the heap of their merit Has any limit
“The merit from cultivating this absorption Is abundant
It increases knowledge, While offering to the buddhas is not like that
“Honoring with flowers, fragrances, garlands, Food, drinks, And utensils Is not honoring the buddhas
“Dṛḍhamati, whoever connects with the Dharma— The Dharma realized by me At the seat of awakening— Honors the buddhas
“Whoever pursues that Dharma And wants to behold buddhas Should immediately pursue this absorption— Precisely this kind of Dharma
“Whoever engenders sublime joy Based on having attained this absorption Has previously known Many thousands of buddhas.
This concludes the fourteenth chapter
“Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, in order to swiftly actualize the superknowledges, one should eagerly undertake the worship, restoration, and cleansing of stūpas
For, Dṛḍhamati, any noble son or daughter who cleans a stūpa of the thus-gone ones will acquire four pristine, excellent aspirations
What are those four aspirations
They are the pristine, excellent aspiration for one’s form; the pristine, excellent aspiration for perfect leisure; the pristine, excellent aspiration for the stability of one’s vows; and the pristine, excellent aspiration for beholding thus-gone ones
“The accomplishment of virtuously engendering aspirations Is that thus-gone ones will emerge, Just as emanations emerge Through the discernment of apprehending
“Wheels on the soles of the feet and below the toes Will appear among their marks
I will explain such a sublime confluence of features as this, So listen carefully
“My marks are likewise perfectly apparent
They are evenly distributed on my fingers and toes
Perfectly exalted and evenly distributed, Their distribution is extremely exalted
“The luminosity of my marks is exalted, And shines like ten million light rays
Standing flooded with light, like Mount Meru
My body is crowned with a net of light rays
“On those marks, which embody the essence, One hundred million light rays are present
The names of each of them are different, And so is their luminosity and color
“From one of my light rays another thousand lights emerge, Which are all present in multiple colors
They will perform the deeds of awakened ones, Even after the earth throughout the trichiliocosm has collapsed
“I was born from the light of awakening
I did not come from the fruition of actions
Upon seeing the light of thus-gone ones
Men and women become intoxicated
“Thus-gone ones will manifest for many tens of millions of eons, Or in the arrays of different buddha realms
Wherever I performed awakened deeds, Victorious ones will likewise manifest miraculous displays
“My absorption is all-illuminating
It fully illuminates buddha realms
The so-called luminous banner of Meru is exalted, An
the absorption called valiant progress is exalted
“Among those with an all-pervasive vision of phenomena, Some pristine ones will see buddhas manifesting here
Some will see them entering the womb, being born, And fearlessly and audaciously taking seven steps here
“Thinking, ‘The victorious one will awaken to buddhahood,’ They will see buddhas seated in awakening at the center of the earth
Some will think they will turn the wheel of Dharma
Some will think they will act for the sake of awakening
“Look at the radiance of that absorption, Which produces these miraculous displays
Some will think that my life span is an eon
Some, however, will think it is half an eon
“Then, some will think it is an intermediate eon— Others, that it is two, three, four, or more eons. Then, some will think that it is ten million years, An
some will fully see the actual length
“Humans will perceive that my life span In this Jampudvīpa is eighty years
Some will perceive my life span to be a day and a night
Some will perceive my life span to be long
“Still others will think that it is like a day and a night For the gods in this trichiliocosm
Beings will understand precisely according to their inclinations, An
oral instructions will be dispensed to them accordingly
“They will likewise by transformed according to their inclinations, As wisdom is likewise taught to them accordingly
Through being so taught, their interest will be aroused
This is the marvel of the supernatural powers
“If their own state of being were revealed
Unwise people would go mad
Who would not be gladdened Upon seeing what my experience and state of being are
“Those who have understood my experience Will turn the wheel of Dharma
Yet when preaching the Dharma for a variety of inclinations, They will not fully understand my experience
“Those who do not understand the experience of the omniscient Will only teach a few expressions of Dharma
Seeing that they have no perception whatsoever, Their minds will be damaged
“Those who understand the reality of the thus-gone ones Are never mentally damaged
They all adhere to such an experience Of the sameness of phenomena
“Except for these eight monks Who are seated in front of me with palms joined, There will never be anyone here in the future, Dṛḍhamati, To uphold this sūtra
“Dṛḍhamati, they have continually partaken Of the incomparable experience of past buddhas
They have always approached, Being vessels for the Dharma
“They fully took on the mind of awakening, And were continually praised by buddhas
I know that just as they sit before me, So too did they in the past
“They have sat in the presence of as many victorious ones As there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
They will be present later, in the final five hundred years of the Dharma, When I too will uphold that supreme awakening
“In later times, the wisdom of the victorious ones will be theirs, An
you too, Dṛḍhamati, will be courageous in it
There will also be eight million other heroes Who will set out to uphold all teachings
“I too will listen to the Dharma there
Having heard it, I will abide by the Dharma, Practicing it without respite. Then I will teach it
“And by teaching it, I will prophesy supreme awakening
Upon hearing their own predictions given, May the eight million be filled with joy, And levitate to a height of seven palm trees.
The Savior of the World then said to Ānanda
“Would you be delighted and able To uphold this Dharma For the wicked in the future?
“I would not be so delighted,” he said to the Blessed One
The victorious one then knowingly said to Kāśyapa
“Kāśyapa, will you uphold this Dharma
You should uphold the Dharma once I have passed!
“I would not delight in doing so,” said Kāśyapa
“This trichiliocosm upholds all people, Oceans, mountains, and forests, And delights in bearing many other loads besides. “Bu
I would not delight in carrying this load
Who will uphold the Dharma in the future
It would be very difficult for me to control the monks. As they will not abide by this teaching
“There is no need to mention that the guide of the world will have passed beyond
They will say, ‘Kāśyapa, you have become too old,’ And so, in the future, my words will not be followed
They will not abide by my teachings
“Thinking, ‘We are adept in this and reflect on its meaning,’ They will reflect upon poetics and materialism, And likewise adhere to mundane grammar
Discarding concentration and absorption, “They cavort with the worldly
They will be prosperous and widely renowned, And continually regarded by the world
I could never examine them
“And I see severe problems
While I was dwelling alone in the forest
A god appeared and said to me
‘The victorious ones have taught such a Dharma
“ ‘Many beings have been tamed in the Dharma of the noble ones
Monks have become adept in concentration and absorption, And perfected the liberations, miraculous abilities, and powers
Hearing this, Śakra will be pleased
“ ‘How amazing this is today!
Later he will come to me, And crying unhappily, declare
‘Kāśyapa, the Dharma will soon disappear.
“Hearing that I will be upset, And not be eager to teach much
I am not eager to uphold that sūtra, Fo
the monks will cower before it. “They will not be pleased with the supreme speech, An
then the divine assembly will gather there.
The Blessed One said to Kāśyapa
“I already knew, Kāśyapa, that the way of Dharma cannot be upheld
“There is no one here among my hearers Who will uphold such sūtras as that
Except for those authorized by me To uphold such sūtras
“Those who will later have no doubt, Will have had their doubts resolved by me
Why have those sūtras, more powerful than others, Never before been practiced
“The monks who uphold them are new and young, While the sūtras are extensive
How will those who do not uphold such a Dharma Reach its other shore
“Dṛḍhamati, those who see me today While I teach Will, in future times of great peril, Acquire joy upon hearing that Dharma
“I have explained only apprehension
The fearless should have faith in those words of mine
Those who have seen the teacher in this life Will be delighted to uphold that Dharma
“They will pursue such wisdom And then make offerings to the guides
They will worship relics and memorials too
The fearless will act as such at that time.
This concludes the fifteenth chapter
Ānanda then rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee and asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma discourse
How will it be upheld?
The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, you should uphold this Dharma discourse as Upholding the Roots of Virtue 
You should also uphold it as Foundation of the Collection of Merit , or Aid to the Bodhisattvas , or The Inquiry Posed by the Bodhisattvas , or The Chapter that Resolves All Doubts .
After the Blessed One thus spoke
the venerable Ānanda, the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati, the other bodhisattvas, the great hearers, and the world with its gods, humans, demigods, and gandharvas were all pleased and praised what the Blessed One had said
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “Upholding the Roots of Virtue.

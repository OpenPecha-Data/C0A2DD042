Thus have I heard at one time
The Blessed One was dwelling in the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages near Vārāṇasī
twelve thousand bodhisattvas that include
together with a great saṅgha of twenty thousand worthy monks an
At that time the Blessed One, surrounded and venerated by a retinue of several hundred thousand beings, was teaching the Dharma
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha stood up
draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee
With his palms together, he bowed toward the Blessed One
and inquired of the Blessed One
The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha
How is it that, as soon as they attain that absorption, they emanate whatever bodies in whatever way will perfect sentient beings’ roots of virtue, and teach the Dharma according to sentient beings’ inclinations
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha
“Padmaśrīgarbha, excellent
Padmaśrīgarbha, previously you have served the victorious ones
“What does it mean to engage in authentic conduct
As they see reality, they will unite with reality
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
As they unite with reality, nothing will impede their mind
As nothing impedes their mind, they will engage in authentic conduct
As they do not abide, they will see reality
neither abiding internally nor externally
Also in attendance were twenty thousand gods who had all entered the Great Vehicle, such as Susīma and Su­pratiṣṭhita­buddhi
Padmaśrīgarbha, those bodhisattvas must not abide anywhere in the three realms
“What is that single quality
The Blessed One said
When the Blessed One had spoken this teaching
and he listened as the Blessed One had directed him
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra entitled The Illusory Absorption
Translated, edited, and finalized by the Indian scholar Surendrabodhi and the translator-editor Bandé Yeshé Dé
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “Wonderful!
Blessed Thus-Gone One, you speak the truth
Blessed One, if it is so that were I to become a buddha
and other women should happen to hear this Dharma teaching, they will also be freed from being a woman as soon as they hear it
Then I shall explain it to you.
Padmaśrīgarbha, therefore, listen well and pay attention
and instead develop the mind of unsurpassed and perfect awakening
All phenomena arise in dependence
There is no phenomenon that can remain constantly
All phenomena arise from circumstances
There is no phenomenon that arises without circumstances
Any phenomenon that arises in dependence is unborn
Therefore all phenomena are unborn
To realize that all phenomena are unborn is to know how to practice the bodhisattva’s path
In this way, one attains the basis for benefiting all being
and can proceed with a compassionate outlook
“Blessed One, with an altruistic motivation I have decided to give up any jealousy and stinginess
Then a young girl named Viraja rose from her seat in the congregation and, motivated by altruistic thoughts, announced
Any sentient being who holds this Dharma teaching in their hands or hears it, and subsequently feels devotion for it, will give rise to roots of virtue before ten thousand buddhas.
The Blessed One said, “Sons of noble family, what you have said is true
Then Śakra, who is lord of the gods, Brahmā, who rules the Sahā world, the four great kings
and many hundreds of thousands of gods scattered divine māndārava flowers on the Blessed One and the bodhisattva great beings
unless there are the two causative factors, jealousy and stinginess.
“Padmaśrīgarbha, if any woman hears this Dharma teaching, she will immediately be transformed from the state of a woman
The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha
While playing billions of divine instruments, they called out
it is not like the realm of the earth
All those beings that person supports with his head, shoulders, or hands for limitless tens of millions of eons
For as long as he lives, he offers them clothing and food
and provides them with all types of pleasant provisions and services
“A lot of merit is created when just a single person develops a loving attitude, even if only for as long as it takes him to snap his fingers
So how much more would be created if someone embraces all beings with love and serves them with all necessities for their happiness for endless, limitless, tens of millions of eons?
“Padmaśrīgarbha, it is just as you say,” said the Blessed One
“For innumerable trillions of eons, these two holy beings have perfected the roots of virtue
Padmaśrīgarbha, these two holy beings have attained the illusory absorption
“As soon as one attains this absorption, one emanates whatever bodies in whatever way will perfect sentient beings’ roots of virtue, and one teaches the Dharma according to sentient beings’ inclinations
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha declared to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, is there any bodhisattva great being here in this gathering who has attained this illusory absorption?
“Padmaśrīgarbha,” replied the Blessed One, “there are sixty holy beings here in this gathering who intentionally wear the armor and who have attained the illusory absorption
As they abide within the illusory absorption
they can demonstrate such miraculous emanations
Padmaśrīgarbha, when you look toward the east, what do you see?
There are sixty holy beings, including the bodhisattva great beings Maitreya and Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, who have attained this illusory absorption.
“Blessed One, did these holy beings attain this illusory absorption here in this world
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha was amazed, and exclaimed to the Blessed One
As he saw this, he was filled with great wonder
“Blessed One, when the Thus-Gone One has passed into nirvāṇa, I will take hold of this sūtra, which has been taught by the Thus-Gone One, and grasp it, read it, understand it, and teach it extensively to others.
The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha and the  million bodhisattvas then all declared, in a single voice
Or did these holy beings attain this illusory absorption in some other realm?
At the feet of all of those blessed buddhas were the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta, prostrating and inquiring about their health, saying
The Blessed One answered, “Padmaśrīgarbha, to the west of this buddha realm, passing through one trillion buddha realms, there is a realm known as Sukhāvatī
Right now the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha resides there, flourishes there, lives there, and teaches the Dharma
In his buddha realm live the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta, both of whom have attained this absorption
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One
The Blessed One replied
“It is thus that other bodhisattvas, too, should perfect their conduct, actions, and aspirations
What was his name? Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, please tell us!
It is amazing to see so many blessed buddhas making prophecies regarding these two holy beings!
And how long ago was that
“Blessed One, from which thus-gone one did these two holy beings develop the mind set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
Then the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
Witnessing this, thirty-two thousand beings in the retinue of the Blessed One developed the mind set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. Such were the miracles that the Blessed One produced
In a similar way, the entire retinue present could see the buddha realms in all ten directions
“Blessed One, there must be many bodhisattva great beings who attained the illusory absorption in that buddha realm
Blessed One, the reason is that the bodhisattva great beings who are born in that buddha realm can engage in Dharma conversations with those two holy beings without any effort.
“Padmaśrīgarbha, it is exactly as you say,” said the Blessed One
“The bodhisattva great beings who abide there within the illusory absorption are indeed limitless and countless.
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha implored the Blessed One
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha was amazed, and exclaimed to the Blessed One
Then the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
and all places of deep darkness throughout the world were bathed in that golden light
His name was Blessed Buddha King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play
Throughout the entire trichiliocosm
The light pervaded this entire trichiliocosm with a bright golden radiance
I will only give you a mere illustration of this, just to mention a few of the qualities, so listen
they will render irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.
and a teacher of gods and men
an unsurpassed charioteer who trained beings
He was a blissful one who knew the world
the sons and daughters of noble family will arouse the mind of unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
They will make aspirations to be born in that buddha realm and, as soon as they are born there
Here in this buddha realm they will be able to behold Sukhāvatī as well as the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha. Witnessing that
They will hear the Dharma talks of those two holy beings, and they, too, will thereby attain the illusory absorption
the sons and daughters of noble family who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will perfect their roots of virtue
Blessed One, that if those two holy beings come to this buddha realm
The reason is
Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, please use your miraculous powers to show a mental sign by which the two holy beings will come to this Sahā world
Toward the west, crossing through a trillion buddha realms, that brilliant golden light pervaded the entire realm of Sukhāvat
“Padmaśrīgarbha, you may wonder what that ‘expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the boundless seal’ might be
Well, Padmaśrīgarbha, it is that bodhisattva great beings never fail to strive for boundless activities
That Blessed, Thus-Gone One knew the king’s good intentions, so he taught him how to gain expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the boundless seal
Padmaśrīgarbha, King Glorious Splendor had no formal duties, so together with his sons he worshipped the Blessed One for  trillion years
The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, that being so, I ask you to listen well to what I will say and keep it in mind.
The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha said, “Blessed One, excellent!
There, the light prostrated at the feet of the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, circumambulated him seven times, and, in that blessed one’s presence, disappeared
All those beings sustained themselves on the joy of concentration and the joy of the Dharma, and in that buddha realm there was no gross type of food
Son of noble family, it is because base sentient beings may distrust the Thus-Gone One’s teachings
They were all born in a miraculous manner
All those young princes had been born out of chastity
“In that buddha realm not even the word ‘woman’ was heard
“No, Padmaśrīgarbha, there were not,” answered the Blessed One
“Blessed One, were there no women in that buddha realm?
Then the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
Padmaśrīgarbha, King Glorious Splendor also had seventy-six thousand pleasure groves for his enjoyment, while each of his sons had ten thousand pleasure groves.
Padmaśrīgarbha, King Glorious Splendor had one billion sons
“Blessed One, in this assembly there are sons and daughters of noble family who are dedicated to the vast, indeed extremely dedicated
All the young princes had the twenty-eight marks of a great being, and all of them had genuinely attained unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
“Padmaśrīgarbha, back then, during the life of the blessed Thus-Gone One, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, there was a virtuous and religious king who ruled over a thousand worlds. He was known as Glorious Splendor
this teaching will also appear to beings yet to come. So it is for the sake of the welfare and happiness of many beings that I request the Thus-Gone One to explain.
They never fail to undertake boundless efforts
and exclaimed, “Homage to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni!
“Blessed One, how much merit is created when a son or daughter of noble family remembers this sūtra taught by the Thus-Gone One, carries it, reads it, comprehends it, and extensively and genuinely teaches it to others?
At this spectacle, everyone present exclaimed, “Blessed One, we now see the extent to which these two bodhisattva great beings are cared for by those blessed buddhas
And why? Because those bodhisattvas’ generosity is boundless
Their discipline is boundless
Their patience is boundless
Their diligence is boundless
Their concentration is boundless
Their knowledge is boundless
Their embrace of saṃsāra is boundless
Their love for beings is boundless
Their display of realms is boundless
Their hearers are boundless
Their perfect forms are boundless
Their voices are boundless
Their eloquence is boundless
You may wonder how dedication can make it boundless
“Padmaśrīgarbha, bodhisattvas will dedicate any root of virtue that has been created, even a single instance of the thought of awakening, so that it becomes boundless
“Their emptiness is boundless
Their signlessness is boundless
Their wishlessness is boundless
Their lack of conditioned existence is boundless
In this way they are free of desire and liberated within the realm of phenomena, the limit of reality
Son of noble family, in short, all phenomena are boundless
They are unborn, serene, free, beyond suffering, and boundless
That, son of noble family, is called boundless dedication
As they saw it all, as clearly as seeing an āmalakī fruit right in their own hand, they were filled with joy and great happiness
and it is through their passing into the parinirvāṇa of a buddha that they will pass into parinirvāṇa
Well, at the time bodhisattvas dedicate that root of merit to all sentient beings, the non-birth of all those sentient beings is actualized
Therefore all phenomena are said to be unborn and unceasing
Whatever is unborn and unceasing is boundless
“Padmaśrīgarbha, the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play
As soon as the bodhisattva great beings and the great hearers had spoken these words
taught King Glorious Splendor perfectly how to gain expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the boundless seal
They joined the palms of their hands and prostrated toward the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni while they called out, “Homage to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni!
so that he, too, could reflect on the boundless Dharma
Then, as King Glorious Splendor received the teaching on the boundless Dharma from that blessed one, he was satisfied and pleased
He rejoiced and was extremely delighted
Since he was so joyful and happy, together with his sons he praised that blessed one with these verses: 
‘Guide, you are the master of all dharmas
Seven thousand monks freed their minds from defilements without further clinging
Then, at that time, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara an
the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta caused a miracle by which the entire retinue could see all the limitless, uncountable blessed ones in the ten directions making prophecies for their unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Such was the miracle that they performed
Eight trillion four hundred thousand million beings purified their eye of Dharma regarding phenomena so that it became stainless and unobscured
” Then the Blessed One prophesied their unsurpassed and perfect awakening
In those buddha realms, limitless and countless beings heard the name of the Thus-Gone Śākyamuni
Those buddha realms, too, all shook in six ways when touched by that light
the name of that Blessed One was also pronounced in many other buddha realms
“Sons of noble family, not only was the name of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni pronounced in this buddha realm
The Thus-Gone Amitābha said to the two holy beings
Blessed One, it is like this
Why
Blissful One, it is amazing
Blessed One, it is amazing
“The Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni has attained very stable powers
Standing together, the two holy beings said to the Blessed One
We rejoice in their names!” And they continued
they respectfully stood to one side
Dharma physician, you develop compassion And teach on the unsurpassed state of peace
Prostrating with their heads to the Blessed One’s feet
Then, from within the retinue,  million gods, men, and other beings called out in a single voice
“ ‘You know well all beings’ actions
“We pay homage to all thus-gone ones: those yet to come, those who presently remain, and those in the ten directions who have passed into nirvāṇa
Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta went before the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha
it vibrated, shuddered, and reeled; quivered, trembled, and quaked; wobbled, rocked, and swayed; boomed, thundered, and roared; rattled, shook, and convulsed; and clattered, rattled, and clanged
, and thereby perfected their roots of virtue and rendered irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
Yet through the workings of merit the mind is purified And the guides become visible
Then, from among the assembly of bodhisattvas, four hundred million bodhisattvas heard the name of the Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni
It is exceedingly difficult to behold the perfect man
“ ‘During an inconceivable number of trillions of eons
When they heard it, they all gathered and, in a single voice, dedicated the roots of virtue toward unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
Always find themselves before the blissful one
The Blessed One also prophesied that they would render irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.
And were not intimidated by the acts of previous buddhas
Those who have the vast inclinations to be within its scope
“ ‘When from the expansive cloud of Dharma the rain of teachings falls
“ ‘When from the expansive cloud of Dharma the rain of teachings falls
We prostrate to you, unrivaled perfect man
More splendorous than ten million suns
The body of the Victor is like a golden mountain
“ ‘A gathering of merit endowed with the supreme marks
That Blessed One would not send forth such a wonderful and beautiful light without any causes and conditions
“ ‘Supreme man, your compassion is such That it is a compassion unrivaled By all hearers and conditioned sages In all the infinite worlds
The Thus-Gone Amitābha said to the two holy beings, “Sons of noble family, what you say is true
‘The sun, the moon, and the light of fires
The radiance of Śakra, Brahmā, jewels, and lightning
Are eclipsed by the splendor of the Blissful One
We prostrate to you, luminous leader of men
“ ‘Sage, throughout an ocean of eons
You perform many hardships
We prostrate to you, incomparable ocean of wisdom. 
You conquer the hordes of theoreticians; You eliminate all of the demons’ disputes and disturbing emotions
That is why the Blessed One Śākyamuni emitted this wonderful and beautiful light as an omen of that Dharma teaching.
it was amidst those sentient beings who have base desires and raging attachment, anger, and delusion
Because the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, gave up all the many perfectly pure buddha realms and, through his aspirations and great compassion, manifested in that afflicted buddha realm. Because he undertook austerities
“Sons of noble family, come
we, Blessed One, will travel to that Sahā world.
that he fully awakened to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood.
As soon as the two holy beings had spoken these words, all of the bodhisattva great beings in the world of Sukhāvatī assembled and said in a single voice
“Blessed One, any being who even hears the name of the Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, reaches excellent attainments
That being so, what need is there to mention those who actually see him with their physical eyes and engender faith
She will recollect her past lives and attain unimpeded eloquence and retention.
and as she moves to the next life, she will take ordination
The Blessed One said
She will always see the Buddha, listen to the Dharma, and serve the Saṅgha
She will render irreversible her progress to unsurpassed and perfect awakening
and after  million eons she will destroy saṃsāra
The miraculously manifested mansions were square, structured around four pillars
even and well proportioned, and of excellent design
Each of the mansions was twelve leagues tall and eight leagues wide

some mansions were made of blue lotuses, pink lotuses, water lily, and white lotuses
That world will be called Complete Gathering of Wealth

some mansions were made of flowers of pāruṣaka, mahāpāruṣaka, mañjuṣaka, mahāmañjuṣaka, roca, mahāroca, cakra, mahācakra, sarvacakra, atyartha­śobhati­cakra, candra, mahācandra, atyartha­śobhati­candra, paramacandra, sthāla, and mahāsthāla
some mansions were made of all types of flowers
until he passes into nirvāṇa, he will be worshipped by the bodhisattva Mahā­sthāmprāpta
After he passes into nirvāṇa, that bodhisattva will uphold his sacred Dharma and propagate it, so that the sacred Dharma may remain for long
In each mansion were emanated , goddesses
"Later, when the sacred Dharma has disappeared in that buddha realm, Mahā­sthāmprāpta will awaken there to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood
In each mansion appeared an ornately decorated lion throne upon which the form of a thus-gone one was seated, adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being
some goddesses were proffering vessels of all types of powdered flowers, perfume, incense, flower garlands, and ointments
Some of the goddesses held conches, drums, clay kettle drums, wooden kettle drums, lutes, and flutes, while others sang melodiously, and yet others held up reed pipes, one-stringed lutes, and three-stringed lutes
In this way they were playing instruments, singing songs, and making music in abundance

“Any son or daughter of noble family who hears the names of the Blessed One, the thus-gone Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja
In each of the mansions appeared , pearl garlands, made of white, red, and blue pearls
or the Blessed One, the thus-gone Supra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja, will render irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and perfect awakening
His lifespan and the period of his sacred Dharma will also be the same
In each of the mansions appeared , victory banners made of divinely manufactured fabric, each of them covered in a lattice of small golden bells
so will they be, precisely and without any difference, for the Blessed One, the thus-gone Supra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja
In each of the mansions appeared , censers of incense
In each of the mansions appeared , parasols of various colors, multiple colors, hundreds of thousands of colors, beautiful, well-crafted, and of fine proportions
In each of the mansions appeared , rows of palm trees
In each of the mansions appeared , jewel trees
Just as were the perfect bodhisattvas and the perfect environment belonging to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja
The light shining from each of the mansions extended for , leagues
Such was the layout of all the mansions
and , jewel strings bound them all together
Each of the mansions was surrounded by seven rows of jewel trees
In each of the mansions appeared , lattices of small bells that, when stirred by the wind, sounded tunes resembling the music performed by skilled musicians playing trillions of divine instruments. Such were the sweet and beautiful tunes that rang out from those bells when stirred by the wind
As he perfectly and completely awakens, he will be known as Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja
those two holy beings
As they stood there
The precious qualities displayed in the buddha realm of the Thus-Gone One Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja will be so extensive that even a thus-gone one who is otherwise able to recount how many grains of sand there are in the river Ganges will not be able to be comprehend them
There are so many causes for happiness and the precious qualities found in that buddha realm, but, son of noble family, let me just give you a brief illustration of their number
Then the two bodhisattvas went before the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni
The light that shone from the mansions pervaded this entire trichiliocosm
“The display of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, which I described before, would not equal even one hundredth of this display of qualities
This great display of qualities was absolutely resplendent
Nor would it measure one thousandth, or ever one hundred thousandth of it. In fact no number, analogy, or illustration would suffice
All the bodhisattvas also arrived together with the  million mansions
Such was the miracle that they manifested
In this buddha realm even the names of hearers and solitary buddhas do not exist
This buddha realm is entirely filled with bodhisattvas
At that point the two bodhisattvas miraculously transformed this Sahā world so that it became as even as the palm of a hand
Nor would they measure one thousandth, or even one hundred thousandth of that. In fact no number, analogy, or illustration would suffice
As for his lifespan, it will be  trillion eons
The sacred Dharma that he teaches will remain for  million eons.
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara will awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood at the foot of a Bodhi tree made of various gems
the displays together with  billion bodhisattvas all vanished from the world of Sukhāvatī and arrived here in this Sahā world in just a single moment, a single second, a single instant. It happened as quickly as it takes for a strong person to extend his arm and flex it again
in a single tune and a single voice, praised the Blessed One with these verses
“We prostrate to your unrivaled splendor, your mass of qualities
Great Omniscient Sage, you have perfected all good qualities
You outshine everyone and transcend the desirous path of the three realms
Supreme leader of the Śākyas, we prostrate before your stainless, moon-like face
“Your body is beautiful, like the stainless sun
You wear the armor of the thirty-two perfect signs
And light up the world with your adornments, the excellent marks
Perfect man, no one in the three worlds can compare to you
“When faced by the light from the body of the Blissful One
Is eclipsed, dimmed, and shines no more than a pool of ink
“Victorious One, while present in one realm, You instantaneously go to limitless others for the sake of beings
No one can comprehend the departure and arrival of the teacher
Your many deeds and disciplines tame beings
“In a single pore you can display limitless realms
Yet nothing increases or decreases
This is beyond the workings of karma, cause and effect
No being is harmed, and nothing is confused
They all take refuge fully in the Blissful One
“Son of noble family, after the Thus-Gone One Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa, there will come a night when the sacred Dharma disappears. As soon as that happens, at the break of dawn on the very next day
Son of noble family, when Amitābha passes into nirvāṇa, lotus flowers and trees made of the seven gems will emit several hundred Gates of Dharma similar to the Dharma teachings that the thus-gone one taught
They will always and continuously behold the Buddha and not be separate from him
“In some other realms you manifest in the form of space
Likewise, in other realms you blaze in the form of fire and flames
Yet the bodhisattvas will obtain the absorption of remembering the Buddha
“In order to tame others you display limitless forms
Just as when he was alive, his passing into nirvāṇa will also accomplish sentient beings’ roots of virtue to their full extent
Though he will pass into nirvāṇa, his sacred Dharma will remain for  trillion eons
Therefore, son of noble family, in a distant future the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Amitābha will also pass into nirvāṇa
Son of noble family, although the life of the Thus-Gone One Amitābha is boundless, all compounded phenomena are empty, unstable, without solidity, and fleeting
“Son of noble family, the extent of the Thus-Gone One Amitābha’s life is boundless. Even if you had a trillion eons to describe its limits, it would not be easy
The Blessed One said
To some you appear in the shining form of the Lord of Desire
Lord of the Brahma realm who attained the supremely peaceful absorption
You are supreme among ministers, merchants, and royal counselors
Through the ten virtues, limitless beings are tamed
Fearless when enemies descend, you are unharmed by their attacks
Through meritorious action you become a universal monarch Who masters the four continents in possession of the seven riches
“To benefit beings, for six years you underwent hardship
Great Sage, you left home and lived in the forest
That is how long these two have been developing the mind of awakening
Those two holy beings wear inconceivable armor and possess boundless skills
In fact it is impossible to comprehend the scope of those two beings’ qualities.
Then the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
you also taught the queens and your son
To some you stayed, a pure being, amidst a retinue of queens. Lord of Men
“Son of noble family, at that time, at that point, the world of Sukhāvatī in the west was that world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness.
“During the time of Dīpaṃkara you had abandoned all defilements
And yet, to ripen beings for the supreme wisdom of awakening
Focused in supreme and precious all-pervasive concentration
In order to defeat all the hordes of extremists
You, a pure being, went to the foot of the Bodhi tree
“In order to ripen beings for the supreme wisdom of a buddha
Lord of Men, you entered into the supreme illusory absorption
Victorious One, you took on a physical appearance Of such a kind that would tame the world
The domains of your verbal and mental activity are also unfathomable
How were his perfect hearers? How long did they live? What kind of enjoyments did they have? What was their radiance like
Why, you may wonder, am I making this request? It is so that other bodhisattvas may hear the Thus-Gone One describe the great aspirations of those two holy beings
As they hold the treasury of the Buddha
“Billions of gods Scattered a beautiful rain Of a million flowers, powders, Incense, and clothing
“Padmaśrīgarbha, you should not have any doubts or uncertainties as to whether the person who at that time, at that point, was named King Glorious Splendor was somebody else
“The physical activity of the Blissful One knows no bounds or borders
And why? Because at that time, at that point, the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha was named King Glorious Splendor
Padmaśrīgarbha, you should also not think that at that time, at that point, the two beings called Precious Mind and Perfect Wealth were anybody else
Son of noble family, this was the first time that these two beings developed the mind set upon unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.
“Blessed One, it is amazing how these two holy beings, devoting themselves so much to the profound and without apprehending their own names, have both been developing the mind of awakening for so long
How many other blessed buddhas apart from that thus-gone one have these two holy beings served?
Your body appears from an ocean of merit
“ ‘Gods and men worship your ocean of qualities, And I with my sons offer worship as well
By whatever merit accrues from worshipping the Victor, May we become a great sage like you!
Even if we had billions of eons to speak of them We would be unable to exhaust the ocean of your qualities
“Just as an illusionist, in order to trick others, Will produce many illusory manifestations
so too, you, Lamp of the World, in order to tame beings Produced the many manifestations of your buddhahood
“Heroic Sage, to some you showed the taming of Māra and his armies
And did what no one else out of all the extremist hosts has done
You attained immaculate omniscience beyond nirvāṇa
And turned the unsurpassable and unchanging wheel
“Over many billions of eons you discovered awakening
On all paths you turned the wheel
Lord of Men, like a moon reflected in water, you appear to all
Self-Originated Blissful One in infinite places, we prostrate to you
“To some, you show the Dharma body of a Buddha
The permanent, stable, enduring, unchanging, Immutable, unborn, stainless, and unceasing Dharma
It pervades all the ten directions, which are like an optical illusion
Like the sky, the deeds of the Teacher are impossible to measure
The domain of the Victorious One cannot be understood by sentient beings
“Even if all the beings throughout the ten directions Were as knowledgeable as Śāriputra
They also said, “Hearers of the Blessed One, behold how delightful the world has become.
Are you enjoying good health and well-being?
“Padmaśrīgarbha, the being who had appeared on King Glorious Splendor’s right replied with these verses to King Glorious Splendor
“The wisdom of the perfect Buddha is limitless like the sky
“ ‘My friend, all phenomena are empty, So why do you ask their names
Since all phenomena are devoid of names, What name are you asking for
And the experience of the victorious ones is entirely inconceivable
The assemblies of sons of the victorious ones, hearers, And circumstantial victorious ones cannot comprehend it
“The Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha is asking if the Blessed One is in good health
Are you free from any misfortune and agitation
When the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta had praised the Blessed One with these fitting verses, they asked the Blessed One about his health, saying
“ ‘Whatever nature a name might have It cannot be seen or heard
Thus you show them boundless physical deeds, Skillfully performed to tame infinite beings
And no action can bring it to an end, So what name are you asking for? 
You have bodies as infinite as the element of space
‘Conventionally names are formed, And names are given and spoken
Protector devoid of concept and thought, we prostrate to you
Thus, my name is Precious Mind, And he is Perfect Wealth.
“You have crossed to the other shore of the vast ocean of suffering
When the bodhisattvas and great hearers here in the Sahā world saw the great display of mansions that pervaded this entire world
as well as its many riches, they were amazed and thought to themselves
“Padmaśrīgarbha, then the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha spoke the following verses to the two beings
“ ‘If you give rise to the mind of awakening In order to help all embodied beings
You will be venerating the buddhas With their thirty-two major marks
“ ‘A being may make offerings By filling as many buddha realms As there are grains of sand in the Ganges River With flowers for the protectors of the world
“ ‘Yet if a person joins his palm
And bows to the mind of awakening
His merit will be much larger And know no bounds
And no other similar glory.
“Padmaśrīgarbha, once again the two beings addressed the blessed one in verse
“ ‘In the presence of the protector of the world
We make a firm commitment
Gods and men, listen To this unsurpassed lion’s roar
“ ‘However long it may have been Since saṃsāra’s unknowable beginning
For that long, even if it takes many eons, We shall act for the welfare of beings
“ ‘For as many eons as have passed Since the very beginning
“ ‘So, too, for any feelings of anger, dullness, Jealousy, and avarice
We shall always speak truthfully And give up all lies
“ ‘If, from today on, Without attaining stainless awakening
Our attitude should become like that of the hearers, This pledge would have been a lie
“ ‘We shall also abstain from Delighting in the ways of solitary buddhas
For ten million eons, We shall feel compassion for beings
“ ‘In that realm there shall be no hearers
Nor any guides who are solitary buddhas
At that time, there shall only be bodhisattvas Numbering tens of millions
So shall we, too, produce a perfect realm
“ ‘Guide, just as your realm Has tens of millions of other qualities Beyond these accomplishments
“Padmaśrīgarbha, once these two beings had spoken these verses, the king attained the five types of clairvoyance
Padmaśrīgarbha, these two beings then spoke these verses to the blessed one
circumambulated the blessed one three times, joined the palms of their hands together, and stood to one side
They prostrated with their heads to the blessed one’s feet
Together with King Glorious Splendor, the two beings then went before the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play
Please teach us this point, And we shall follow your advice!’ 
“ ‘Victorious one, how should we venerate you
Should it be with lotus flowers, perfume, Flower garlands, clothing, Or perhaps with food and drink
“ ‘Perfect buddha, foremost among men, How should we venerate you
Padmaśrīgarbha, then the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha spoke the following verses to the two beings
They sat cross-legged in the flowers
“ ‘Are the two of you gods or nāgas
Or humans or nonhumans
Or yakṣas, gandharvas, or kiṃnaras
Victor, you are impartial toward all beings
We prostrate to you, who are completely at peace. 
‘Perfect man, you have gone beyond all attachments
We prostrate to you, who are like wind and space. “ ‘Great sage, your qualities are like a treasure
And your realization is like earth, water, and fire
You know no agitation and are beyond deceit and deception
You have reduced to rubble the massive mountain of pride
“ ‘You have pulled out the tree of rebirth by its root
You are a benefactor of the Dharma with a peaceful mind
Having crossed over, you liberate others who were in bondage
We prostrate to you, Blissful One
“ ‘You who see the truths and teach the ultimate
And yet fill the world like a vessel
They know no actual coming or going
“ ‘The bodies of the Victor fill the entire realm of phenomena And are present in all infinite realms
And the guides become visible
From those two lotus flowers, two beings miraculously appeared: one bore the name Precious Mind, and the other was called Perfect Wealth
“ ‘You are like a physician for all beings in the three existences; You purify all attachment, anger, and darkness
“ ‘Seeing that beings are pained by many sufferings
And tormented by birth, old age, sickness, and death, Great sage, your compassion for them Will never change as you teach the Dharma of peace
Since the result of that activity is so beautiful, Beings never tire of beholding you
At that point, inspired by the Buddha, the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One
“Is it due to the power of the Thus-Gone One, or is it due to the power of these bodhisattva great beings, that all of this has arrived here from the world of Sukhāvatī?
The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha
“Padmaśrīgarbha, that these many jewel mansions now fill up and adorn this Sahā world is not due to the power of the Thus-Gone One
Rather, it is due to the power of the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta.
Therefore, Padmaśrīgarbha, listen very well and keep in mind what I will now explain.
The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, consider this analogy
Imagine a person splits the tip of a hair into one hundred pieces, and then uses the tip of one of those pieces to lift up one drop of water from the ocean
as well as the display of qualities of his hearers and the causes for their happiness
I would not run out of things to say
and I would be unable to complete my description of the display of qualities in that buddha realm
Padmaśrīgarbha, even if I had as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River to describe the display of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play
That blessed, thus-gone one taught the Dharma exclusively within the three vehicles
His saṅgha of bodhisattvas was also of comparable size
“His saṅgha of hearers was also endless. Right now the Thus-Gone Amitābha’s saṅgha of hearers is said to be boundless
but the saṅgha of hearers belonging to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, was a hundred thousand times larger than that
“The amount of water extracted from the ocean in a single drop by that person using a hundredth of a hair tip represents the displays of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha
while the body of water remaining in the ocean represents the displays of precious qualities in Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness, the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play
Are you enjoying good health and well-being?
“Blessed One, all these many mansions that now fill up and adorn this Sahā world are amazing! Blissful One, they are truly amazing
“In order to gaze upon, honor, venerate, and serve the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, and also to hear his Dharma teaching
Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta said to the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha
the bodhisattva great beings Harisiṃha, Siṃhamati, Su­pratiṣṭhita­buddhi, Anupamamati, Dharaṇīṃdhara, Agnidatta, Varuṇa, Ratnākara, Guhyagupta, Bhadrapāla, Vidyutdeva, Vairocana, Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, Jñānākara, Anikṣiptadhura, Amoghadarśin, and the bodhisattva great being Maitreya
If this is an opportune moment for the Blessed One to grant me answers to some questions of mine, may I put them to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha
Padmaśrīgarbha, it is always opportune for the Thus-Gone One to address your concerns. Padmaśrīgarbha, ask the Thus-Gone One, the worthy, completely perfect Buddha, whatever you wish, and I will address your questions, so that you may feel at ease
How do they quickly awaken to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood
Blessed One, how is it that bodhisattva great beings render irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, come to possess the five types of clairvoyance, and attain the illusory absorption
gathered the roots of virtue
venerated a myriad buddha
You feel love and compassion for all beings, an
that is why you ask the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha about this. That is excellent
Padmaśrīgarbha, there is one quality that, if bodhisattva great beings possess it, renders irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, an
grants them the five types of clairvoyance an
the illusory absorption. Moreover, as soon as they attain that absorption, they emanate whatever bodies in whatever way will perfect sentient beings’ roots of virtue
teach the Dharma according to sentient beings’ inclinations, an
quickly awaken to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood
With such conviction, one comes to understand that all phenomena are illusory
All phenomena are magically manifest because they are imputed. Those imputations are also utterly empty
The realization that all phenomena are empty is the attainment of the illusory absorption
In this way, one quickly awakens to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood
Padmaśrīgarbha, it is from conversations lasting seven days with those two holy beings that other bodhisattva great beings attain this illusory absorption
and the whole Sukhāvatī world together with the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha will also arrive here in this world
The Blessed One, understanding the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha’s request
emitted a bright light from the hair between his eyebrows
all mountain ranges and forests as well as the central mountain
the Mucilinda Mountains, the Greater Mucilinda Mountains, the surrounding mountains, the greater surrounding mountains
eclipsing even the sun and the moon—so well known for their great miraculous ability, great strength, and great power—to the point of invisibility
The beings who lived in Sukhāvatī, includin
the bodhisattvas and the great hearers, looked toward this Sahā world and saw the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni surrounded by the gathering of bodhisattvas and attended upon by the saṅgha of hearers
Just as a person with perfect sight can see the face of another person only a fathom away without any strain
Here in the Sahā world, the assembled retinue of the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni consisted of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragās, humans, nonhumans, Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, and bodhisattvas
All of them could now also vividly see the world of Sukhāvatī and the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, who was shining like the king of mountains, surrounded by the assembly of bodhisattvas and attended upon by the saṅgha of hearers. They saw the entire buddha realm in this way
from this world and this buddha realm they saw the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, as well as the world of Sukhāvatī, which appeared in a great display of fine features, filled with trillions of qualities
Witnessing it, they were filled with joy and great happiness, an
exclaimed, “Homage to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha!
When that buddha realm was shown to them, , beings here in this buddha realm, who had not previously aroused the mind of awakening, now gave rise to the mind set upon unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
They dedicated the roots of virtue toward taking birth in the world of Sukhāvatī, as well as toward unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
In the world of Sukhāvatī, the assembled bodhisattva great beings and great hearers saw the Sahā world and were amazed
the entire world shook in six ways
When so much as the name of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni was pronounced, even this inanimate earth shook in six ways
Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta said to the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha
The Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, has sent forth a light that we have previously never seen nor heard of
And why? Because the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, is about to deliver a Dharma teaching on how to accomplish the precious absorption known as ‘the bodhisattvas’ application.
Now, since the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, would not emit such a wonderful and beautiful light without causes or circumstances
please tell us what the causes and conditions are for the Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, to send forth such a wonderful and beautiful light
Sons of noble family, you know that the time has come for the Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, to teach the Dharma to an assembly headed by the two of you, so please do go ahead
the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta called out to the four hundred million bodhisattvas assembled in the retinue of the Blessed One, the thus-gone Amitābh
In order to behold, honor, venerate, and serve the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, and also to hear his Dharma teaching, let us travel to the Sahā world
Why
Blessed One, we shall also travel to the Sahā world in order to behold, honor, venerate, and serve the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, and also to hear his Dharma teaching
Sons of noble family, you know that the time has come, so please go ahead
So the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta set out from the world of Sukhāvatī, surrounded and preceded by  million bodhisattvas
At that point they manifested their miraculous powers, and by those miraculous power
 million bodhisattvas each emanated  million mansions
some were made of red pearl, emerald, and coral
some were made of combinations of gold and silver
and some were made of flowers of various colors, multiple colors, hundreds of thousands of colors, beautiful, pure, and shining
some goddesses were holding vessels of powdered flowers of māndārava, mahāmāndārava, pāruṣaka, mahāpāruṣaka, mañjuṣaka, mahāmañjuṣaka, roca, mahāroca, cakra, mahācakra, sarvacakra, atyartha­śobhati­cakra, candra, mahācandra, atyartha­śobhati­candra, paramacandra, sthāla, and mahāsthāl
In each of the mansions appeared ponds, the bottom of each lined with gold dust, adorned with beryl and crystal, and encircled by a ring of the seven precious gemstones. The ponds were filled with blue and pink lotuses, water lilies, and white lotus flowers, and on them were wild geese calling out. The ponds were filled to the brim with water of eight properties, making them excellent for the birds to quench their thirst
Inside each of those mansions, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta then again emanated the entire display of all the mansions that they had produced, along with all of their elaborate internal contents, in a precise copy
had emanated those displays inside each of the mansions
They prostrated with their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, the worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, and circumambulated him three times before standing off to one side
The light of the sun, the moon, every jewel and fire in the world, That of any human, or gods like Śakra and Brahmā
To remedy others, gods and humans lacking fear and careless in their ways, Once you show them the unbearably afflicted realms, The states to which they could go as hell beings, animals, and pretas
To some supreme beings you display the pure lands, Where there are no hell beings, animals, or pretas, And which are full of the renowned sons of the victorious ones— A realm of perfect delight beyond the eight unfree states
You manifest by filling other realms with wate
These emanations are the domain of omniscient wisdo
the Lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the thousand-eyed blazing vajr
Many hundreds of beings are delighted and worship yo
With the four means of attracting disciples, you gather beings And establish them on the path to perfect awakening
To some, here in this world, you demonstrated birth, And taking seven steps over the ground
With your beautiful voice endowed with eight aspects, you said: ‘This birth of mine will bring an end to birth and death.
You gave up your parents, your cherished retinue of friends and relatives, Your kingdom, wealth, and many treasuries of jewels
Śakra, Brahmā, and the demigods revered yo
In no time at all, you will be separated from your loved ones, So it is no good for you to put your trust in this compounded world
you show them how all beings are like a dream, an illusion, a mirage, And impermanent, unstable, and momentary
They could not fathom the limitless scope of the victorious Dharma King’s nature, Nor the entirety of the Victorious One’s domain
e praise you, Victorious One, tamer of disturbing emotions, and foremost being
May all the merit gained thereby go to all beings So that they may reach precious, supreme, peaceful, and blissful awakening
Did all of this arrive here in the Sahā world from the world of Sukhāvatī due to the power of the Thus-Gone One or due to the power of these bodhisattvas
Because of their power, this Sahā world is now filled and adorned with these many jewel mansions
The perfection of the aspirations and roots of virtue of these two holy beings is inconceivable! Blessed One, it is amazing
Blissful One, it is truly amazing
When the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha looked toward the east with the unobscured divine eye of a bodhisattv
he saw as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, with as many blessed buddhas as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
The Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha is asking if the Blessed One is in good health
Are you free from any misfortune and agitation
The same thing occurred in the south, in the west, in the north, below, above, and in all the ten directions. In all directions Padmaśrīgarbha saw as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, filled with and adorned by a great display of mansions made of various precious substances
In all those buddha realms he saw blessed buddha
he witnessed the two holy beings prostrating before all those blessed buddhas
The accomplishment of the illusory absorption by these two holy beings is inconceivable
Blessed One, it is amazing! Blissful One, it is truly amazing
Why do I say so
Because these two holy beings abide in that absorption, and thus are present in all buddha realms
The Blessed One then produced a miraculous display so that the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha could see the buddha realms in all ten directions
He could also behold blessed buddhas in those buddha realms, and he saw how the two holy beings prostrated at the feet of the blessed ones
behold the blessed buddhas in those buddha realms, and see the two holy beings prostrated at the feet of the blessed ones
The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha said, “Blessed One, excellent!” an
he listened as the Blessed One had advised
“Padmaśrīgarbha,” continued the Blessed One
Padmaśrīgarbha, tell me, are there many displays of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha
Blessed One, there are indeed—inconceivably many. They are limitless, and it would not be easy to describe them in words
previously, in times past, an inconceivable number of eons ago, an endless number of eons ago, at a time stretching further back than any number of eons, a number of eons so great that the number of atoms found in , worlds—all the limitless and inconceivable number of such atoms—would not equal the number of eons, there was a world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness
was a blessed, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha who had perfect knowledge and conduct
Padmaśrīgarbha, in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, there was a display of precious qualities
which would be greater, the amount of water that has been extracted or the water that remains
Blessed One, the extracted water would be less. The amount remaining is measureless
Padmaśrīgarbha, think about this and understand i
Since you understand everyone in the infinite worlds
You teach the Dharma that brings them To supreme nirvāṇa
Padmaśrīgarbha, on another occasion King Glorious Splendor was in his pleasure grov
practicing concentratio
two beautiful and captivating lotus flowers made of uragasāra sandalwood sprang up on either side of hi
Padmaśrīgarbha, when King Glorious Splendor arose from his absorption, he saw those two beings sitting there, cross-legge
and at the sight he spoke this verse
Friends, please answer this question
In emptiness, there are no gods, No nāgas or rākṣasa
Nor any humans or nonhumans. None of them exist within emptiness
Padmaśrīgarbha, the other being then spoke to King Glorious Splendor in these verses
Name is empty of name; In names there are no names
All phenomena are devoid of names, And still they are described using names
The one with superior intelligence has shown The mind of awakening, precisely as it is. There is no other comparable offerin
for that many eons We shall act as you have taught In order to help beings
If, from today on, We should feel any desire
We will have betrayed The buddhas in the ten directions
The beings who enjoy this realm Will all be stainles
They will perfect the dharmas of the Buddh
If things are certain to be like that, And not in any other way
May this entire earth shake With its oceans and mountains
As soon as they said this
The entire world shook, And musical instruments all sounded Without even being played
And why? Because at that time, at that point, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara was the being called Perfect Wealth, an
the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmprāpta was the being called Precious Mind
Then the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One
it may be possible to count the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River. Bu
it is not possible to count the blessed buddhas who were venerated by those two holy beings since the time of that thus-gone one
The Blessed One said
From here, in which direction is that world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness where the Blessed One, the thus-gone King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play lived
The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha requested of the Blessed One
what kind of display of precious qualities the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha manifested in the buddha realm of those two holy beings in order to aid many beings, show love for the world, and bring happiness and health to all, including gods and men
what were the names of the two holy beings after they awakened to unexcelled and completely perfect buddhahood
Please tell u
other sentient beings will no longer behold that thus-gone one
Son of noble family, even if one were to gather all of the hearers, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattvas of the Blessed Amitābha
they would not equal even one hundredth of the bodhisattva saṅgha of the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja
He will appear in that world as a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, a learned and virtuous being, a blissful one, someone who knows the world, an unsurpassed charioteer who tames beings, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed buddha known as Supra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja
Padmaśrīgarbha, any woman who hears the account of how the Blessed One, the thus-gone King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, passed into nirvāṇa, and who hears the name of these two future buddhas, will no longer have the identity of a woma
Blessed One, this entire gathering now engenders the mind of unsurpassed and perfect awakening
The Blessed One said, “Son of noble family, it could be asked what would be accomplished and what would be the reason for me to reply to the question you have put to the Thus-Gone One
and will therefore continue to meet with harm, unhelpful situations, unhappiness, and misfortune
and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed him. Then the Blessed One said
Son of noble family, say there is a man who is strong, powerful, and with great amounts of merit
Now, however many beings one may think there are in what one thinks of as the realm of beings, the Thus-Gone One has said that there are many more than that
Now tell me, Padmaśrīgarbha, would that man’s merit increase greatly on this basis
Padmaśrīgarbha, you should be inspired by this, and you should fully understand i
any son or daughter of noble family who, immersed in faith and full of interest, develops the mind of awakening based on a sūtra that the Thus-Gone One has taught, like this one, and takes hold of the sūtra, remembers it, reads it, understands it, and teaches it extensively to other
will, based on that foundation, give rise to a much greater amount of merit
Blessed One, we too will take hold of this sūtra and grasp it, read it, understand it, and teach it extensively to others
Those sentient beings who hear this Dharma teaching, grasp it, and teach it extensively to others will reap a great profit
to that end, Blessed One, may all my woman’s organs now disappear from my body, and those of a man appear
Instantly the girl’s female organs vanished, and her body became that of a ma
of whom the Blessed One prophesied that his progress to unsurpassed and perfect awakening had now been rendered irreversible, and that he would become a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha named Repeller of All Disturbing Emotions
the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha, the monks, and the many bodhisattvas, as well as the world with its gods, men, demigods, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said

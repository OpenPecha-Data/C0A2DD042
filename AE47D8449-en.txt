Reverence to all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, noble disciples, and pratyekabuddhas, in the past, the present, and the future
Thus did I hear on a single occasion
Guardians of the city of Dharma
they upheld the true doctrine
The Lord Buddha was in residence in the garden of Āmrapālī, in the city of Vaiśālī, attended by a great gathering. Of bhikṣus there were eight thousand
all arhats
They were free from impurities and afflictions
and all had attained self-mastery
Their minds were entirely liberated by perfect knowledge
They had accomplished their work
done what they had to do
cast off their burdens
attained their goals
and totally destroyed the bonds of existence
Their true knowledge had made their minds entirely free
They all had attained the utmost perfection of every form of control over their minds
Without having to be asked, they were the natural spiritual benefactors of all living beings
They maintained unbroken the succession of the Three Jewels
conquering devils and foes and overwhelming all critics
Their mindfulness, intelligence, realization, meditation, incantation, and eloquence all were perfected
They were free of all obscurations and emotional involvements
living in liberation without impediment
Of bodhisattvas there were thirty-two thousand
great spiritual heroes who were universally acclaimed. They were dedicated through the penetrating activity of their great superknowledge
and were sustained by the grace of the Buddha
What is that
It consists of the great love which is consummated in enlightenment
of mindfulness, consummated by the six remembrances
of positive thought, consummated through the truly enjoyable Dharma
The bodhisattva Śrīkūṭa declared
“ ‘Defilement’ and ‘purification’ are two
The bodhisattva Sunakṣatra declared
“ ‘Distraction’ and ‘attention’ are two
When there is no distraction, there will be no attention, no mentation, and no mental intensity
Thus, the absence of mental intensity is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Subāhu declared
“ ‘Bodhisattva spirit’ and ‘disciple spirit’ are two
When both are seen to resemble an illusory spirit, there is no bodhisattva spirit, nor any disciple spirit
Thus, the sameness of natures of spirits is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Animiṣa declared
“ ‘Grasping’ and ‘nongrasping’ are two
What is not grasped is not perceived
and what is not perceived is neither presumed nor repudiated
Thus, the inaction and non-involvement of all things is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Sunetra declared
“ ‘Uniqueness’ and ‘characterlessness’ are two
The bodhisattva Puṣya declared
“ ‘Good’ and ‘evil’ are two
Seeking neither good nor evil, the understanding of the nonduality of the significant and the meaningless is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Siṃha declared
“ ‘Sinfulness’ and ‘sinlessness’ are two
By means of the diamond-like wisdom that pierces to the quick, not to be bound or liberated is the entrance into nonduality.
Great Kings of medicine
of purity of livelihood, consummated by correct spiritual practice
of the respect of noble ones, consummated by joyful and faithful service
of soberness of mind, consummated by absence of dislike for ordinary people
of high resolve, consummated by renunciation
of skill in erudition, consummated by religious practice
of retirement in solitary retreats, consummated by understanding things free of afflictions
of introspective meditation, consummated by attainment of the buddha-gnosis
of the stage of the practice of yoga, consummated by the yoga of liberating all living beings from their afflictions
Were one to extol them for innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of eons, one still could not exhaust their mighty flood of virtues
and they glorified innumerable buddhafields with the splendor of these virtues. They conferred great benefit when seen, heard, or even approached
they could apply the medicine of the Dharma appropriately
They were inexhaustible mines of limitless virtues
“Lord, as soon as the householder had discoursed thus, two hundred brahmins among the crowd of brahmins present conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
And there were other powerful gods: Brahmās, Śakras, Lokapālas, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
Finally, there was the fourfold community, consisting of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, laymen, and laywomen
The Lord Buddha, thus surrounded and venerated by these multitudes of many hundreds of thousands of living beings, sat upon a majestic lion-throne and began to teach the Dharma
Dominating all the multitudes, just as Sumeru, the king of mountains, looms high over the oceans, the Lord Buddha shone, radiated, and glittered as he sat upon his magnificent lion-throne
took from around my neck a necklace of pearls worth one hundred thousand pieces of gold and offered it to him
’“Then, Vimalakīrti took the pearls and divided them into two halves
The surface of the entire billion-world galaxy was reflected in the interior of the great precious canopy
He gave one half of them to the lowliest poor of the city, who had been disdained by those present at the sacrifice
At this vision of the magnificent miracle effected by the supernatural power of the Lord Buddha, the entire host was ecstatic, enraptured, astonished
And the voices of all the buddhas of the ten directions could be heard proclaiming their teachings of the Dharma in all the worlds, the sounds reverberating in the space beneath the great precious canopy
The other half he offered to the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha
finally, all the villages, suburbs, cities, capitals, provinces, and wildernesses. All this could be clearly seen by everyone
“Then the poor of the city, having seen that miracle and having heard that teaching, conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
so great that it formed a covering for this entire billion-world galaxy
Mañjuśrī replied
delighted, satisfied
and filled with awe and pleasure. They all bowed down to the Tathāgata
“Pure are your eyes, broad and beautiful, like the petals of a blue lotus
Pure is your thought, having discovered the supreme transcendence of all trances
The superb and radiant fields of the sugatas appear before us
And your extensive spiritual teachings that lead to immortality Make themselves heard throughout the whole reach of space
Expert in the deep analysis of things, you teach their ultimate meaning
and gazed upon him with fixed attention
Sovereign Lord of Dharma, obeisance to you
“All these things arise dependently, from causes
Yet they are neither existent nor nonexistent
And thereby the Three Jewels were revealed
He accomplishes all the activities of the bodhisattvas
He penetrates all the secret mysteries of the bodhisattvas and the buddhas
“Those who are well disciplined by your precious Dharma Are free of vain imaginings and always deeply peaceful
He is skilled in civilizing all the abodes of devils
He plays with the great superknowledges
He is consummate in wisdom and liberative art
Supreme doctor, you put an end to birth, decay, sickness, and death. Immeasurable ocean of virtue, we bow to you
“Like Mount Sumeru, you are unmoved by honor or scorn
You love moral beings and immoral beings equally
Poised in equanimity, your mind is like the sky
Who would not honor such a precious jewel of a being
“Great Sage, in all these multitudes gathered here
Who look upon your countenance with hearts sincere in faith
Each being beholds the Victor, as if just before him
This is a special quality of the Buddha. “Although the Lord speaks with but one voice
Those present perceive that same voice differently
And each understands in his own language according to his own needs
This is a special quality of the Buddha. “From the leader’s act of speaking in a single voice
Some merely develop an instinct for the teaching, some gain realization
Some find pacification of all their doubts
This is a special quality of the Buddha. “We bow to you who command the force of leadership and the ten powers
We bow to you who save the suffering beings! We bow to you who do not remain in the migrations
“You associate with living beings by frequenting their migrations
Such, Mañjuśrī, is the great love of a bodhisattva.
Yet your mind is liberated from all migrations
Just as the lotus, born of mud, is not tainted thereby, So the lotus of the Buddha preserves the realization of voidness
“You nullify all signs in all things everywhere
You are not subject to any wish for anything at all
The miraculous power of the buddhas is inconceivable
We bow to you, who stand nowhere, like infinite space.
Then, the young Licchavi Ratnākara, having celebrated the Buddha with these verses, further addressed him
“Lord, these five hundred young Licchavis are truly on their way to unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
the love that is happiness because it introduces living beings to the happiness of the Buddha
the love that is without deceit because it is not artificial
the love that is high resolve because it is without passions
the love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivation
Therefore, young man, listen well and remember
I will explain to you the purification of the buddhafield of the bodhisattvas.
the love that is without formality because it is pure in motivation
the love that is liberative art because it shows the way everywhere
the love that is wisdom because it causes attainment at the proper time
the love that is contemplation because it refrains from indulgence in tastes
the love that is effort because it takes responsibility for all living beings
the love that is tolerance because it protects both self and others
the love that is morality because it improves immoral living beings
the love that is giving because it bestows the gift of Dharma free of the tight fist of a bad teacher
“For example, Ratnākara, should one wish to build in empty space, one might go ahead in spite of the fact that it is not possible to build or to adorn anything in empty space
He embraces a buddhafield to the same extent that, through entrance into that buddhafield, living beings increase their noble spiritual faculties
He embraces a buddhafield to the same extent that, through entrance into a buddhafield, living beings are introduced to the buddha-gnosis
He embraces a buddhafield to the same extent that living beings become disciplined
The Buddha said
Therefore, all things stand on the root that is baseless
Thereupon, a certain goddess who lived in that house
“Noble son, a buddhafield of bodhisattvas is a field of living beings
and the five hundred young Licchavis, and they set themselves to listen
having heard this teaching of the Dharma of the great heroic bodhisattvas, and being delighted, pleased, and overjoyed
Please, Lord, explain to them the bodhisattvas’ purification of the buddhafield!
and they have asked what is the bodhisattvas’ purification of the buddhafield
“Yet, Ratnākara, a bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of positive thought
The great disciples shook the flowers and even tried to use their magical powers, but still the flowers would not shake off
When he attains enlightenment, living beings free of hypocrisy and deceit will be born in his buddhafield
Then, the goddess said to the venerable Śāriputra
“‌Noble son, a bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of high resolve
“Reverend Śāriputra, why do you shake these flowers?
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who have harvested the two stores and have planted the roots of virtue will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of virtuous application
The goddess said
“Do not say that, reverend Śāriputra
Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instincts for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated their instincts
Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all instincts.
Then the venerable Śāriputra said to the goddess
“Goddess, how long have you been in this house?
At that, the elder Śāriputra fell silent
Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the question.
Likewise, syllables are neither internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else
Therefore, reverend Śāriputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning speech
But those free of pride are taught that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself liberation
I have no realization
Therefore I have such eloquence
Whoever thinks, “I have attained! I have realized!” is overly proud in the discipline of the well taught Dharma
I belong to the solitary sage vehicle when I teach the twelve links of dependent origination to those who need them
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who live by all virtuous principles will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is the magnificence of the conception of the spirit of enlightenment
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who are actually participating in the Mahāyāna will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of generosity
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who give away all their possessions will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of morality
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who follow the path of the ten virtues with positive thoughts will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of tolerance
When he attains enlightenment, living beings with the transcendences of tolerance, discipline, and the superior trance—hence beautiful with the thirty-two auspicious signs—will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of effort
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who devote their efforts to virtue will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of meditation
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who are evenly balanced through mindfulness and awareness will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is a field of wisdom
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who are destined for the ultimate will be born in his buddhafield
That is the third strange and wonderful thing
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield consists of the four immeasurables
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield consists of the four means of unification
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who are held together by all the liberations will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is skill in liberative art
When he attains enlightenment, living beings skilled in all liberative arts and activities will be born in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield consists of the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment
and their great teachings resounded like the lion’s roar throughout the ten directions
The bodhisattva Siṃhamati declared
“To say, ‘this is impure’ and ‘that is immaculate’ makes for duality
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is his mind of total dedication
When he attains enlightenment, the ornaments of all virtues will appear in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is the doctrine that eradicates the eight adversities
When he attains enlightenment, the three bad migrations will cease, and there will be no such thing as the eight adversities in his buddhafield
One who, attaining equanimity, forms no conception of impurity or immaculateness, yet is not utterly without conception
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, this house is never forsaken by Śakra, Brahmā, the Lokapālas, and the bodhisattvas from all the other buddhafields
That is the second strange and wonderful thing
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield consists of his personal observance of the basic precepts and his restraint in blaming others for their transgressions
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, whoever enters this house is no longer troubled by his afflictions from the moment he is within
That is the first wonder of this house
When he attains enlightenment, even the word ‘crime’ will never be mentioned in his buddhafield
“A bodhisattva’s buddhafield is the purity of the path of the ten virtues
A light of golden hue shines here constantly, so bright that it is hard to distinguish day and night, and neither the moon nor the sun shines here distinctly
What are these eight
Reverend Śāriputra, eight strange and wonderful things manifest themselves constantly in this house
Reverend Śāriputra, I have been in this house for twelve years, and I have heard no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning the great love, the great compassion, and the inconceivable qualities of the Buddha
One who is free of all calculations, through the extreme purity of gnosis—his mind is aloof, like empty space; and thus he enters into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Nārāyaṇa declared
“Thus, noble son, just as is the bodhisattva’s production of the spirit of enlightenment, so is his positive thought
And just as is his positive thought, so is his virtuous application
That is the fourth strange and wonderful thing
“His virtuous application is tantamount to his high resolve
his high resolve is tantamount to his determination
his determination is tantamount to his practice
That is the fifth strange and wonderful thing
his practice is tantamount to his total dedication
his total dedication is tantamount to his liberative art
This world has the nature of voidness, so there is neither transcendence nor involvement
neither progress nor standstill
The bodhisattva Dāntamati declared
“ ‘Life’ and ‘liberation’ are dualistic
Having seen the nature of life, one neither belongs to it nor is one utterly liberated from it
Such understanding is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Pratyakṣadarśa declared
“ ‘Destructible’ and ‘indestructible’ are dualistic
What is destroyed is ultimately destroyed
Thereupon, magically influenced by the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra had this thought
The bodhisattva Vidyuddeva declared
“ ‘Knowledge’ and ‘ignorance’ are dualistic
“If the buddhafield is pure only to the extent that the mind of the bodhisattva is pure
“ ‘Self’ and ‘selflessness’ are dualistic
Since the existence of self cannot be perceived, what is there to be made ‘selfless’? Thus, the nondual vision of their nature is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Samantagupta declared
The experience of such is called ‘the entrance into the principle of nonduality.’ 
and what is instantaneous is indestructible
What is indestructible is instantaneous
What is ultimately destroyed does not become destroyed; hence, it is called ‘indestructible.
The natures of ignorance and knowledge are the same
then, when Śākyamuni Buddha was engaged in the career of the bodhisattva
his mind must have been impure
Otherwise, how could this buddhafield appear to be so impure?
The Buddha, aware of venerable Śāriputra’s thoughts, said to him
“What do you think, Śāriputra
Is it because the sun and moon are impure that those blind from birth do not see them?” Śāriputra replied, “No, Lord. It is not so
The fault lies with those blind from birth, and not with the sun and moon.
for ignorance is undefined, incalculable, and beyond the sphere of thought
The realization of this is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Priyadarśana declared
“Matter itself is void
The Buddha declared, “In the same way, Śāriputra
That is the sixth strange and wonderful thing
the fact that some living beings do not behold the splendid display of virtues of the buddhafield of the Tathāgat
is due to their own ignorance. It is not the fault of the Tathāgata
Śāriputra, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is pure, but you do not see it.
Then, the Brahmā Śikhin said to the venerable Śāriputra
“Reverend Śāriputra, do not say that the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is impure
Reverend Śāriputra, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is pure
I see the splendid expanse of the buddhafield of the Lord Śākyamuni as equal to the splendor of, for example, the abodes of the highest deities.
Then the venerable Śāriputra said to the Brahmā Śikhin
That is the seventh strange and wonderful thing
“As for me, O Brahmā, I see this great earth, with its highs and lows, its thorns, its precipices, its peaks, and its abysses, as if it were entirely filled with ordure.
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, at the wish of this good man, to this house come the innumerable tathāgatas of the ten directions, such as the Tathāgatas Śākyamuni, Amitābha, Akṣobhya, Ratnaśrī‌, Ratnārcis, Ratnacandra, Ratnavyūha, Duḥprasāha, Sarvārtha­siddha, Prabhūtaratna, Siṃhanādanādī, Siṃhaghoṣa, and so forth
Brahmā Śikhin replied
and when they come they teach the door of Dharma called The Secrets of the Tathāgatas, and then depart
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, all the splendors of the abodes of the gods and all the splendors of the fields of the buddhas shine forth in this house
That is the eighth strange and wonderful thing
Reverend Śāriputra, these eight strange and wonderful things are seen in this house
Who then, seeing such inconceivable things, would believe the teaching of the disciples
Likewise, it is dualistic to dedicate morality, tolerance, effort, meditation, and wisdom for the sake of omniscience
Reverend Śāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, “What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?
and the nature of omniscience itself is total dedication
The nature of generosity is itself omniscience
Now, would you think, “What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?
“The dedication of generosity for the sake of attaining omniscience is dualistic
The bodhisattva Akṣayamati declared
To live in such peace is to enter into nonduality.
“The fact that you see such a buddhafield as this as if it were so impure
And Śāriputra, transformed into the goddess, replied
“I no longer appear in the form of a male
reverend Śāriputra, is a sure sign that there are highs and lows in your mind and that your positive thought in regard to the buddha-gnosis is not pure either
Similarly, ‘ear’ and ‘sound,’ ‘nose’ and ‘smell,’ ‘tongue’ and ‘taste,’ ‘body’ and ‘touch,’ and ‘mind’ and ‘phenomena’—all are dualistic
My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!
Reverend Śāriputra, those whose minds are impartial toward all living beings and whose positive thoughts toward the buddha-gnosis are pure see this buddhafield as perfectly pure.
All women appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the form of a woman
While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women
But to know the mind, and to be neither attached, averse, nor confused with regard to phenomena—that is called ‘peace.
Thereupon the Lord touched the ground of this billion-world galactic universe with his big toe
With this in mind, the Buddha said, ‘In all things, there is neither male nor female.’ 
“ ‘Eye’ and ‘form’ are dualistic
The bodhisattva Sumati declared
Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to their ordinary form
“Reverend Śāriputra, what have you done with your female form?
a magnificent array of many hundreds of thousands of clusters of precious gems
The gnosis that penetrates the elements in such a way is the entrance into nonduality.
Likewise, the present itself is also the nature of space
The future itself is also the nature of space
until it resembled the universe of the Tathāgata Ratnavyūha, called Ananta­guṇa­ratna­vyūha
The past itself is also the nature of space
The four main elements are themselves the nature of space
“To say that the four main elements are one thing and the etheric space-element another is dualistic
The bodhisattva Prabhāketu declared
Such understanding of the five compulsive aggregates and the knowledge of them as such by means of gnosis is the entrance into nonduality.
but the nature of consciousness is itself voidness
Voidness does not result from the destruction of consciousness
Consciousness itself is voidness
Voidness does not result from the destruction of matter
but the nature of matter is itself voidness
Therefore, to speak of voidness on the one hand, and of matter, or of sensation, or of intellect, or of motivation, or of consciousness on the other, is entirely dualistic
are attaining perfect buddhahood, and will go on attaining perfect buddhahood.
The buddhas are neither past, nor present, nor future
Their enlightenment transcends the three times
But tell me, elder, have you attained the state of arhat
Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the venerable elder Śāriputra
Then, both men and gods who subscribed to the disciple vehicle thought
“Reverend Śāriputra, this goddess has already served ninety-two million billion buddhas
Then, the Lord withdrew his miraculous power and at once the buddhafield was restored to its usual appearance
Omniscience is the nature of wisdom
and total dedication is the nature of omniscience
and the five hundred Licchavi youths who had accompanied the young Licchavi Ratnākara all attained the conformative tolerance of ultimate birthlessness
The bodhisattva Gambhīrabuddhi declared
“It is dualistic to say that voidness is one thing, signlessness another, and wishlessness still another
What is void has no sign
What has no sign has no wish
“‌Noble sir, how does the bodhisattva follow the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha?
Where there is no wish there is no process of thought, mind, or consciousness
To see the doors of all liberations in the door of one liberation is the entrance into nonduality.
Even should he go into the states of the animals, he remains free of darkness and ignorance
The bodhisattva Sāntendriya declared
“It is dualistic to say ‘Buddha,’ ‘Dharma,’ and ‘Saṅgha.
The Dharma is itself the nature of the Buddha
the Saṅgha is itself the nature of the Dharma
When he goes into the states of the asuras, he remains free of pride, conceit, and arrogance
When he goes into the realm of the lord of death, he accumulates the stores of merit and wisdom
When he goes into the states of motionlessness and immateriality, he does not dissolve therein
“He may follow the ways of desire, yet he stays free of attachment to the enjoyments of desire
and all of them are uncompounded
The uncompounded is infinite space
He may follow the ways of hatred, yet he feels no anger toward any living being
and the processes of all things are equivalent to infinite space
Adjustment to this is the entrance into nonduality.
When this splendor of the beauty of the virtues of the buddhafield shone forth, eighty-four thousand beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment
The bodhisattva Apratihatacakṣu declared
“It is dualistic to refer to ‘aggregates’ and to the ‘cessation of aggregates.
Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Śāriputra
He may follow the ways of folly, yet he is ever conscious with the wisdom of firm understanding
“Śāriputra, do you see this splendor of the virtues of the buddhafield?
“He may follow the ways of avarice, yet he gives away all internal and external things without regard even for his own life
Everyone in the entire assembly was filled with wonder, each perceiving himself seated on a throne of jeweled lotuses
He may follow the ways of immorality, yet, seeing the horror of even the slightest transgressions, he lives by the ascetic practices and austerities
The Buddha said
He may follow the ways of wickedness and anger, yet he remains utterly free of malice and lives by love
He may follow the ways of laziness, yet his efforts are uninterrupted as he strives in the cultivation of roots of virtue
He may follow the ways of sensuous distraction, yet, naturally concentrated, his contemplation is not dissipated
Aggregates themselves are cessation
He may follow the ways of false wisdom, yet, having reached the transcendence of wisdom, he is expert in all mundane and transcendental sciences
“He may show the ways of sophistry and contention, yet he is always conscious of ultimate meanings and has perfected the use of liberative arts
He may show the ways of pride, yet he serves as a bridge and a ladder for all people
Śāriputra, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa heaven all take their food from a single precious vessel
yet the nectar that nourishes each one differs according to the differences of the merits each has accumulated
It is necessary to know and to understand this fact of the ultimate inactivity of all things
Just so, Śāriputra, living beings born in the same buddhafield see the splendor of the virtues of the buddhafields of the buddhas according to their own degrees of purity.
whose nature of inactivity is the same as the nature of inactivity of the mind
The nature of inactivity of the body is the same as the nature of inactivity of speech
He may show the ways of the passions, yet he is utterly dispassionate and naturally pure
He may follow the ways of the māras, yet he does not really accept their authority in regard to his knowledge of the qualities of the Buddha
“Physical, verbal, and mental vows do not exist dualistically
“Śāriputra, this buddhafield is always thus pure
He may follow the ways of the disciples, yet he lets living beings hear the teaching they have not heard before
The bodhisattva Suvinīta declared
He may follow the ways of the solitary sages, yet he is inspired with great compassion in order to develop all living beings
“He may follow the ways of the poor, yet he holds in his hand a jewel of inexhaustible wealth
He may follow the ways of cripples, yet he is beautiful and well adorned with the auspicious signs and marks
He may follow the ways of those of lowly birth, yet, through his accumulation of the stores of merit and wisdom, he is born in the family of the tathāgatas
in order to bring about the maturity of inferior living beings
but the Tathāgata makes it appear to be spoiled by many faults
He may follow the ways of the weak, the ugly, and the wretched, yet he is beautiful to look upon, and his body is like that of Nārāyaṇa
“He may manifest to living beings the ways of the sick and the unhappy, yet he has entirely conquered and transcended the fear of death
“He may follow the ways of the rich, yet he is without acquisitiveness and often reflects upon the notion of impermanence
The bodhisattva Puṇyakṣetra declared
“Alas! All constructed things are impermanent.” Thereby, thirty-two thousand living beings purified their immaculate, undistorted Dharma-eye in regard to all things
The eight thousand bhikṣus were liberated from their mental defilements, attaining the state of nongrasping
And the eighty-four thousand living beings who were devoted to the grandeur of the buddhafield
“It is dualistic to consider actions meritorious, sinful, or unmoving
He may show himself engaged in dancing with harem girls, yet he cleaves to solitude, having crossed the swamp of desire
having understood that all things are by nature but magical creations
all conceived in their own minds the spirit of unexcelled, totally perfect enlightenment
He observed a pure morality in order to protect the immoral
His wealth was inexhaustible for the purpose of sustaining the poor and the helpless
He lived with the deportment of a buddha
and his superior intelligence was as wide as an ocean
He was praised, honored, and commended by all the buddha
and was respected by Indra, Brahmā, and all the Lokapālas. In order to develop living beings with his skill in liberative art, he lived in the great city of Vaiśālī
Knowing the strength or weakness of their faculties, and being gifted with unrivaled eloquence, he taught the Dharma appropriately to each
Having integrated his realization with skill in liberative art, he was expert in knowing the thoughts and actions of living beings
He was liberated through the transcendence of wisdom
He had penetrated the profound way of the Dharma
He had conquered all demons and opponents
He had attained the power of incantations and the fearlessnesses
He played with the great superknowledges
Having applied himself energetically to the Mahāyāna, he understood it and accomplished his tasks with great finesse
“It is dualistic to detest the world and to rejoice in liberation, and neither detesting the world nor rejoicing in liberation is nonduality
The bodhisattva Ratna­mudrā­hasta declared
and likewise with the natures of all things
The entrance into this equanimity is the entrance into nonduality.
“ ‘Darkness’ and ‘light’ are dualistic, but the absence of both darkness and light is nonduality
The bodhisattva Candrottara declared
“Duality is constituted by perceptual manifestation
Nonduality is objectlessness
Therefore, nongrasping and nonrejection is the entrance into nonduality.
The bodhisattva Śrīgarbha declared
Who thus abides in nonduality is without ideation, and that absence of ideation is the entrance into nonduality.
However, one who lives among created things, in the mines of passions, without seeing any truth, is indeed capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment
but true understanding of self does not result in dualism
“Dualism is produced from obsession with self
The bodhisattva Padmavyūha declared
The nonaccomplishment of such actions is the entrance into nonduality.
In short, noble sir, the sixty-two kinds of convictions constitute the family of the tathāgatas!
but where there is ultimately no bondage where is there need for liberation
The mendicant who is neither bound nor liberated does not experience any like or any dislike and thus he enters nonduality.
The bodhisattva Maṇikūṭarāja declared
“It is dualistic to speak of ‘good paths’ and ‘bad paths’
One who is on the path is not concerned with good or bad paths
The bodhisattva Satyananda declared
“It is dualistic to speak of ‘true’ and ‘false.
When one sees truly, one does not ever see any truth, so how could one see falsehood
Then, the elder Mahākāśyapa applauded the crown prince Mañjuśrī
“Good! Good, Mañjuśrī! This is indeed well spoken! This is right
so likewise, without going into the ocean of passions, it is impossible to obtain the mind of omniscience
He had attained tolerance as well as eloquence
Having served the ancient buddhas, he had generated the roots of virtue by honoring them and making offerings to them
When the bodhisattvas had given their explanations, they all addressed the crown prince Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, what is the bodhisattva’s entrance into nonduality?
Mañjuśrī replied
At that time, there lived in the great city of Vaiśālī a certain Licchavi, Vimalakīrti by name
“Good sirs, you have all spoken well. Nevertheless, all your explanations are themselves dualistic
To know no one teaching, to express nothing, to say nothing, to explain nothing, to announce nothing, to indicate nothing, and to designate nothing—that is the entrance into nonduality.
Then, the crown prince Mañjuśrī said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
“We have all given our own teachings, noble sir. Now, may you elucidate the teaching of the entrance into the principle of nonduality!
Thereupon, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti kept his silence, saying nothing at all
Here there is no use for syllables, sounds, and ideas.
When these teachings had been declared, five thousand bodhisattvas entered the door of the Dharma of nonduality and attained tolerance of the birthlessness of things
Thereupon, the venerable Śāriputra thought to himself
“If these great bodhisattvas do not adjourn before noontime, when are they going to eat?
and his consciousness of working for the welfare of living beings
“Reverend Śāriputra, the Tathāgata has taught the eight liberations. You should concentrate on those liberations, listening to the Dharma with a mind free of preoccupations with material things
Just wait a minute, reverend Śāriputra
and you will eat such food as you have never before tasted.
To educate living beings, he would appear at crossroads and on street corners, and to protect them he participated in government
To turn people away from the individual vehicle and to engage them in the Mahāyāna, he appeared among listeners and teachers of the Dharma
In order to be in harmony with people, he associated with elders, with those of middle age, and with the young, yet always spoke in harmony with the Dharma
He engaged in all sorts of businesses, yet had no interest in profit or possessions
Thus should a bodhisattva console a sick bodhisattva, in such a way as to make him happy
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti set himself in such a concentratio
He understood the mundane and transcendental sciences and esoteric practices, yet always took pleasure in the delights of the Dharma
He mixed in all crowds, yet was respected as foremost of all
There is no self in this body
and, except for arbitrary insistence on self, ultimately no ‘I’ which can be said to be sick can be apprehended
Therefore, thinking, ‘ “I” should not adhere to any self, and “I” should rest in the knowledge of the root of illness,
He appeared to be adorned with ornaments, yet always was endowed with the auspicious signs and marks
He seemed to eat and drink, yet always took nourishment from the taste of meditation
He visited the fashionable outsider teachers, yet always kept unswerving loyalty to the Buddha
He made his appearance at the fields of sports and in the casinos, but his aim was always to mature those people who were attached to games and gambling
and the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa teaches the Dharma to a gathering of bodhisattvas only
In that universe, even the names “disciple” and “solitary sage” do not exist
He attained decisive wisdom in order to sustain the foolish
In that universe, the trees emit a fragrance that far surpasses all the fragrances, human and divine, of all the buddhafields of the ten directions
He wore the white clothes of the layman, yet lived impeccably like a religious devotee
He blazed with energy in order to inspire people who were lazy
There the tathāgata named Gandhottama­kūṭa resides, lives, and is manifest
and performed such a miraculous feat that those bodhisattvas and those great disciples were enabled to see the universe called Sarva­gandha­sugandhā, which is located in the direction of the zenith, beyond as many buddhafields as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers
He maintained concentration, mindfulness, and meditation in order to sustain the mentally troubled
and the fragrance of the food eaten by those bodhisattvas pervades immeasurable universes
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti addressed that incarnated bodhisattva
adorned with the auspicious signs and marks, and of such an appearance that he outshone the whole assembly
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, without rising from his couch, magically emanated an incarnated bodhisattva, whose body was of golden color
“Noble son, go in the direction of the zenith and when you have crossed as many buddhafields as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers, you will reach a universe called Sarva­gandha­sugandhā
“Noble sir, did not the Tathāgata declare, ‘Those who are unlearned should not be despised’?
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, are you not ashamed of such a gathering?
But, restrained by the supernatural power of Mañjuśrī, none of them volunteered to go
“Good sirs, is there any among you who would like to go to that buddhafield to bring back some food?
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti addressed the whole gathering of bodhisattvas
Everyone in the gathering at the house of Vimalakīrti was able to see distinctly this universe wherein the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa and his bodhisattvas were taking their meal
having bowed down at his feet, make the following inquiry of him
with which he will accomplish the buddha-work in the universe called Sahā
Thus, those living beings with inferior aspirations will be inspired with lofty aspirations
and the good name of the Tathāgata will be celebrated far and wide.’ 
the incarnated bodhisattva said, “Very good!” to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and obeyed his instructions
In sight of all the bodhisattvas, he turned his face upward and was gone, and they saw him no more
‘May the Lord be gracious and give to me the remains of his meal in order to accomplish the buddha-work in the universe called Sahā
having bowed down one hundred thousand times at the feet of the Lord
To develop children, he visited all the schools
To demonstrate the evils of desire, he even entered the brothels
When he reached the universe Sarva­gandha­sugandhā, he bowed down at the feet of the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa and said
“Lord, the bodhisattva Vimalakīrti, bowing down at the feet of the Lord, greets the Lord, saying: ‘Do you have little trouble, little discomfort, and little unrest? Are you strong, well, without complaint, and living in touch with the supreme happiness?’ He then requests
To establish drunkards in correct mindfulness, he entered all the drinking-houses
He was honored as the merchant among merchants because he demonstrated the priority of the Dharma
He was honored as the landlord among landlords because he renounced the aggressiveness of ownership
Then, the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa poured some of his food, impregnated with all perfumes, into a fragrant vesse
He was honored as the warrior among warriors because he cultivated endurance, determination, and fortitude
He was honored as the brahmin among brahmins because he suppressed pride, vanity, and arrogance
He was honored as the official among officials because he regulated the functions of government according to the Dharma
He was honored as the prince of princes because he reversed their attachment to royal pleasures and sovereign power
“The greatness of that bodhisattva is such that he sends magical incarnations to all the buddhafields of the ten directions, and all these incarnations accomplish the buddha-work for all the living beings in all those buddhafields.
He was honored as a chamberlain in the royal harem because he brought the young ladies to spiritual maturity
He was compatible with ordinary people because he appreciated the excellence of ordinary merits
He was honored as the Indra among Indras because he showed them the temporality of their lordship
He was honored as the Brahmā among Brahmās because he showed them the special excellence of gnosis
He was honored as the Lokapāla among Lokapālas because he fostered the development of all living beings
The bodhisattvas exclaimed
Thus lived the Licchavi Vimalakīrti in the great city of Vaiśālī, endowed with an infinite knowledge of skill in liberative arts
He sends this incarnated bodhisattva here in order to celebrate my name, in order to show the advantages of this universe, and in order to increase the roots of virtue of those bodhisattvas.
There the bodhisattva Vimalakīrti, who lives in the inconceivable liberation, teaches the Dharma to the bodhisattvas
There the Tathāgata Śākyamuni teaches the Dharma to living beings who aspire to inferior ways, in that buddhafield tainted with five corruptions
It is inanimate, being like grass, trees, walls, clods of earth, and illusions
It is void, not existing as self or as self-possessed
This body is unreal, being a collocation of the four main elements
The body is ownerless, being the product of a variety of conditions
Alas! This body is like a machine, a nexus of bones and tendons
Sickness arises from total involvement in the process of misunderstanding from beginningless time
It is like a magical illusion, consisting of falsifications
It is like a dream, being an unreal vision
It is like a reflection, being the image of former actions
It is like an echo, being dependent on conditioning
It arises from the afflictions that result from unreal mental constructions, and hence ultimately nothing is perceived which can be said to be sick
Where is the universe Sahā
‘This body is an aggregate of many things. When it is born, only things are born
It is like a cloud, being characterized by turbulence and dissolution
“Lord, where is there such a great being as this
It is like a flash of lightning, being unstable, and decaying every moment
At that the bodhisattvas of the buddhafield of the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa were astonished and asked the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa
when it ceases, only things cease. These things have no awareness or feeling of each other
and gave it to the incarnated bodhisattva
It is like the trunk of the plantain tree, having no core
And the ninety million bodhisattvas of that universe volunteered to go along with him
It is like a mirage, born from the appetites of the passions
It is like a water bubble, not remaining very long
This body is like a ball of foam, unable to bear any pressure
“Lord, we also would like to go to that universe Sahā, to see, honor, and serve the Buddha Śākyamuni and to see Vimalakīrti and those bodhisattvas.
Thus, my friends, as this body is only a vessel of many sicknesses, wise men do not rely on it
The Tathāgata declared
“Friends, this body is so impermanent, fragile, unworthy of confidence, and feeble
It is so insubstantial, perishable, short-lived, painful, filled with diseases, and subject to changes
When they arrived, Vimalakīrti taught them the Dharma, beginning his discourse from the actuality of the four main elements
It is insensate, being driven like a windmill
It is filthy, being an agglomeration of pus and excrement
It is false, being fated to be broken and destroyed, in spite of being anointed and massaged
It is afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases
It is like an ancient well, constantly overwhelmed by old age
Its duration is never certain—certain only is its end in death
This body is a combination of aggregates, elements, and sense-media, which are comparable to murderers, poisonous snakes, and an empty town, respectively
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti created ninety million lion-thrones exactly like those already there, and the bodhisattvas were seated
“What is the elimination of this sickness
Then the incarnated bodhisattva took the food and departed with the ninety million bodhisattvas and, by the power of the Buddha and the supernatural operation of Vimalakīrti, disappeared from that universe Sarva­gandha­sugandhā and stood again in the house of Vimalakīrti in a fraction of a second
What is the elimination of egoism and possessiveness
Why
What is freedom from dualism
What is absence of involvement with either external or internal
And do not conceive ideas of contempt and aversion for that universe
What is sameness
It is the sameness of everything from self to liberation
And, lest those living beings of the Sahā world become jealous of you, change your bodies to hide your beauty
go without your perfumes
“Noble sons, go ahead if you think it is the right time. But, lest those living beings become mad and intoxicated
“Friends, the body of a tathāgata is the body of Dharma, born of gnosis
How can both be void
They were so cleansed in body and mind that they came at once to the house of Vimalakīrti, along with all eighty-four thousand of the Licchavis
As verbal designations, they both are void, and neither is established in reality
Seeing there the bodhisattvas seated on the high, wide, and beautiful lion-thrones
They all bowed down to those great disciples and bodhisattvas and then sat down to one side
And the gods of the earth
the gods of the realm of desire
and the gods of the realm of pure matter, attracted by the perfume, also came to the house of Vimalakīrti
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti spoke to the elder Śāriputra and the great disciples
It is born of love, compassion, joy, and impartiality
It is born of charity, discipline, and self-control
It is born of the path of the ten virtues
Therefore, it is called nonperception
“Reverends, eat of the food of the Tathāgata! It is ambrosia perfumed by the great compassion. But do not fix your minds in narrow-minded attitudes
lest you be unable to receive its gift.
What does one not perceive
“How can such a huge multitude eat such a small amount of food?
Then the incarnated bodhisattva said to those disciples
What is the thorough understanding of the basis of that object-perception
The three realms of existence are objectified
What is it that is objectified
“Do not compare, venerable ones, your own wisdom and merits with the wisdom and merits of the Tathāgata
What is this basis
one has only to teach them the Dharma for them to realize the basis from which sicknesses arise
If all living beings were to eat for an eon an amount of this food equal to Mount Sumeru in size, it still would not be depleted
“As for these living beings, there is nothing to be applied, and there is nothing to be removed
Indeed, the entire gathering was satisfied by that food, and the food was not at all depleted
It is born of patience and gentleness
It is born of the roots of virtue planted by solid efforts
It is born of the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment
Having eaten that food, there arose in the bodies of those bodhisattvas, disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, and other living beings, a bliss just like the bliss of the bodhisattvas of the universe Sarva­sukha­pratimaṇḍita
And from all the pores of their skin arose a perfume like that of the trees that grow in the universe Sarva­gandha­sugandhā
It is born of mental quiescence and transcendental analysis
If he takes it otherwise, all his efforts will be in vain
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti knowingly addressed those bodhisattvas who had come from the buddhafield of the Lord Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa
Just as one is called ‘hero’ when one overcomes all enemies, so, too, one is called ‘bodhisattva’ when one conquers the miseries of aging, sickness, and death
“Noble sirs, how does the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa teach his Dharma?
They replied
It is born of all the transcendences
It is born from sciences and superknowledges
“The sick bodhisattva should tell himself
“The Tathāgata does not teach the Dharma by means of sound and language
He disciplines the bodhisattvas only by means of perfumes
You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest all ordinary behavior without forsaking cessation
You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your cultivated spiritual nature
You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward external forms
You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment are manifest without deviation toward any convictions
You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you are released in liberation without abandoning the passions that are the province of the world
“Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was unable to reply and remained silent
Therefore, I am reluctant to go to ask that good man about his sickness.
The Buddha then said to the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana
“Maudgalyāyana, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
At the foot of each perfume-tree sits a bodhisattva, and the trees emit perfumes like this one
From the moment they smell that perfume, the bodhisattvas attain the concentration called ‘source of all bodhisattva-virtues.
From the moment they attain that concentration, all the bodhisattvas-virtues are produced in them.
Those bodhisattvas then asked the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
“How does the Buddha Śākyamuni teach the Dharma?
But the great compassion that is free of involvement with sentimentally purposive views does not exhaust the bodhisattva in all his reincarnations
‘Reverend Maudgalyāyana, that is not the way to teach the Dharma to the householders in their white clothes
and these are the retributions for verbal misdeeds
Hence, even his reincarnation is like a liberation
These are verbal misdeeds
and these are the retributions for physical misdeeds
“ ‘Reverend Maudgalyāyana, the Dharma is without a living being, because it is free of the dust of living beings
These are physical misdeeds
It is selfless, because it is free of the dust of desire
It is lifeless, because it is free of birth and death
These are the rebirths with crippled faculties
It is without a person, because it dispenses with past origins and future destinies
“ ‘The Dharma is peace and pacification, because it is free of desire
These are the adversities
This is the world of the lord of death
But one who is himself liberated is able to liberate others from their bondage.
It does not become an object, because it is free of words and letters
This is the animal world
“ ‘This is hell
Here they are
it is inexpressible, and it transcends all movement of mind
What discourses are appropriate
Therefore, the bodhisattva should participate in liberation and should not participate in bondage
“ ‘The Dharma is omnipresent, because it is like infinite space
“What is bondage
How does he discipline the wild and uncivilized
It is without color, mark, or shape, because it is free of all process
Therefore, he teaches them with discourses appropriate for the disciplining of the wild and uncivilized
These are mental misdeeds
and these are the retributions for mental misdeeds
This is killing
This is stealing
This is sexual misconduct
This is lying
This is backbiting
This is harsh speech
This is frivolous speech
This is covetousness
This is malice
This is false view
These are their retributions
Wisdom not integrated with liberative art is bondage, but wisdom integrated with liberative art is liberation
Liberative art not integrated with wisdom is bondage, but liberative art integrated with wisdom is liberation
“How is wisdom not integrated with liberative art a bondage
This is immorality
This is hatred
This is sloth
This is the fruit of sloth
This is false wisdom and this is the fruit of false wisdom
These are the transgressions of the precepts
This is the vow of personal liberation
“How is wisdom integrated with liberative art a liberation
This should be done and that should not be done
“What is the bondage of liberative art not integrated with wisdom
“What is the liberation of liberative art integrated with wisdom
“Mañjuśrī, thus should the sick bodhisattva consider things
His wisdom is the consideration of body, mind, and sickness as impermanent, miserable, empty, and selfless
It is as if an illusory person were to teach the Dharma to illusory people
“ ‘Therefore, you should teach the Dharma by keeping your mind on this
Reverend Maudgalyāyana, where there are no presumptuous words, there is no teacher of the Dharma
no one to listen, and no one to understand
Reverend Mahā­maudgalyāyana, even the expression “to teach the Dharma” is presumptuous
and those who listen to it listen to presumption
“ ‘Reverend Mahā­maudgalyāyana, how could there be a teaching in regard to such a Dharma
Furthermore, his wisdom lies in understanding that body, mind, and sickness are neither new nor old, whether considered simultaneously or sequentially
And his liberative art lies in not seeking pacification or cessation of body, mind, or sicknesses
This is sin and that rises above sin
This is the path and that is the wrong path
“That, Mañjuśrī, is the way a sick bodhisattva should concentrate his mind; he should live neither in control of his mind, nor in indulgence of his mind
This is virtue and that is evil
This is blameworthy and that is blameless
This is an obscuration and that is without obscuration
It is without any fundamental consciousness
And the bodhisattvas who settle in a buddhafield of such intense hardships must have inconceivably great compassion!
transcending the range of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought
The domain of the world yet not the domain of the afflictions, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
Where one understands liberation, yet does not enter final and complete liberation, there is the domain of the bodhisattva
It is without highness and lowness. It abides without movement or activity
Where the four māras manifest, yet where all the works of māras are transcended, there is the domain of the bodhisattva
The bodhisattvas said
It is without establishment and rejection, without birth or destruction
Where one seeks the gnosis of omniscience, yet does not attain this gnosis at the wrong time, there is the domain of the bodhisattva
Where one knows the four noble truths, yet does not realize those truths at the wrong time, there is the domain of the bodhisattva
so living beings who are wild and hard to civilize are disciplined only by means of discourses about all kinds of miseries.
it is remarkable through signlessness, and because of wishlessness it is free of presumption and repudiation
Just as wild horses or wild elephants will not be tamed unless the goad pierces them to the marrow
It is without coming and going, for it never stands still
It is comprised by voidness
It abides at the reality-limit, for it is utterly without fluctuation. It is immovable, because it is independent of the six objects of sense
This is compounded and that is uncompounded
This is mundane and that is transcendental
A domain of introspective insight, wherein one does not arrest voluntary reincarnation in the world, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
This is defiled and that is immaculate
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti declared
“So it is, good sirs! It is as you say
A domain where one realizes birthlessness, yet does not become destined for the ultimate, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
The great compassion of the bodhisattvas who reincarnate here is extremely firm
Where one sees relativity without entertaining any convictions, there is the domain of the bodhisattva
In a single lifetime in this universe, they accomplish much benefit for living beings
Where one associates with all beings, yet keeps free of all afflictive instincts, there is the domain of the bodhisattva
A domain of solitude with no place for the exhaustion of body and mind, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
So much benefit for living beings could not be accomplished in the universe Sarva­gandha­sugandhā even in one hundred thousand eons
The domain of the triple world, yet indivisible from the ultimate realm, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
The domain of voidness, yet where one cultivates all types of virtues, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
What are these ten
The domain of signlessness, where one keeps in sight the deliverance of all living beings, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
Here they are
The domain of wishlessness, where one voluntarily manifests lives in the world, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
to win the poor by generosity
to win the immoral by morality
“A domain essentially without undertaking, yet where all the roots of virtue are undertaken without interruption, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
to win the hateful by means of tolerance
The domain of the six transcendences, where one attains the transcendence of the thoughts and actions of all living beings, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
to win the lazy by means of effort
The domain of the six superknowledges, wherein defilements are not exhausted, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
to win the mentally troubled by means of concentration
to win the falsely wise by means of true wisdom
The domain of living by the holy Dharma, without even perceiving any evil paths, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
to show those suffering from the eight adversities how to rise above them
The domain of the four immeasurables, where one does not accept rebirth in the heaven of Brahmā, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
to teach the Mahāyāna to those of narrow-minded attitudes
to win those who have not produced the roots of virtue by means of the roots of virtue
The domain of the six remembrances, unaffected by any sort of defilement, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
The domain of contemplation, concentration, and absorption, where one does not reincarnate in the formless realms by force of these concentrations and absorptions, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
I must bear all the miseries of all living beings and give all my accumulated roots of virtue to all living beings
The domain of the four foci of mindfulness, where body, sensation, mind, and things are not ultimately of concern, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
without seeking even the slightest benefit for myself
The domain of the four right efforts, where the duality of good and evil is not apprehended, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
‘I must benefit all living beings
It is without ideation, because it is free of mind, thought, or consciousness
What are the eight
It is incomparable, because it has no antithesis
The domain of the four bases of magical powers, where they are effortlessly mastered, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
The domain of the five spiritual faculties, where one knows the degrees of the spiritual faculties of living beings, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
The domain of living with the five powers, where one delights in the ten powers of the tathāgata, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
The domain of perfection of the seven factors of enlightenment, where one is skilled in the knowledge of fine intellectual distinctions, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
“After he transmigrates at death away from this Sahā universe, a bodhisattva must have eight qualities to reach a pure buddhafield safe and sound
It is without presumption of conditionality, because it does not conform to causes
The domain of living by the eightfold path, without even perceiving any evil paths, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
“ ‘It permeates evenly all things, because all are included in the ultimate realm
The domain of the cultivation of the aptitude for mental quiescence and transcendental analysis, where one does not fall into extreme quietism, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
It conforms to reality by means of the process of nonconformity
It is without the concept of “mine,” because it is free of the habitual notion of possession
You should be adept in regard to the spiritual faculties of living beings
“How many qualities must a bodhisattva have, to go safe and sound to a pure buddhafield after he transmigrates at death away from this Sahā universe?” Vimalakīrti replied
Again the bodhisattvas asked
By means of the correct vision of the wisdom-eye
manifesting the great compassion
acknowledging the benevolent activity of the Buddha
Those who engage in these ten virtuous practices do not exist in any other buddhafield.
and to develop living beings without interruption through the four means of unification
I must have no resentment toward any living being
purifying your intentions, and understanding the definitive expressions of the Dharma
you should teach the Dharma in order that the continuity of the Three Jewels may never be interrupted.
I must rejoice in all bodhisattvas as if they were the Teacher
“Lord, when Vimalakīrti had discoursed thus, eight hundred householders in the crowd conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Therefore, Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.
The Buddha then said to the venerable Mahākāśyapa
“Mahākāśyapa, you go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
The domain of manifesting the attitudes of the disciples and the solitary sages without sacrificing the qualities of the Buddha, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
and I myself was speechless
The domain of the realization of the unborn nature of all things, yet of the perfection of the body, the auspicious signs and marks, and the ornaments of the Buddha, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
Why? I remember one day
when I was in the street of the poor begging for my food, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came along and said to me
The domain of conformity to all things utterly pure in nature while manifesting behavior that suits the inclinations of all living beings, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
I must control my mind, without coveting the gains of others, and without taking pride in gains of my own
I must examine my own faults and not blame others for their faults
I must take pleasure in being consciously aware and must truly undertake all virtues.
“If a bodhisattva has these eight qualities, when he transmigrates at death away from the Sahā universe, he will go safe and sound to a pure buddhafield.
When the Licchavi Vimalakīrti an
the crown prince Mañjuśrī had thus taught the Dharma to the multitude gathered there, one hundred thousand living beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
and ten thousand bodhisattvas attained the tolerance of the birthlessness of things
The domain where one turns the wheel of the holy Dharma and manifests the magnificence of ultimate liberation, yet never forsakes the career of the bodhisattva, such is the domain of the bodhisattva!
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti read the thought of the venerable Śāriputra and said
I must not neglect any teachings, whether or not I have heard them before
“Reverend Śāriputra, did you come here for the sake of the Dharma? Or did you come here for the sake of a chair?
Meanwhile, the area in which the Lord was teaching the Dharma in the garden of Āmrapālī expanded and grew larger
and the entire assembly appeared tinged with a golden hue
You should enter homes as if entering the family of the Buddha
Thereupon, the venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha
“Lord, this expansion and enlargement of the garden of Āmrapālī and this golden hue of the assembly—what do these auspicious signs portend?
The Buddha declared
You should accept alms by not taking anything
At that moment the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince Mañjuśrī
Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma has no interest in matter, sensation, intellect, motivation, or consciousness
He has no interest in these aggregates, or in the elements, or in the sense-media
“Ānanda, these auspicious signs portend that the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and the crown prince Mañjuśrī, attended by a great multitude
Interested in the Dharma, he has no interest in the realm of desire, the realm of pure matter, or the immaterial realm
are coming into the presence of the Tathāgata.
Interested in the Dharma, he is not interested in attachment to the Buddha, attachment to the Dharma, or attachment to the Saṅgha
Mañjuśrī replied
“Noble sir, send them if you feel the time is right!
Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma is not interested in recognizing suffering, abandoning its origination, realizing its cessation, or practicing the path
Thereupon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti performed the miraculous feat of placing the entire assembly
replete with thrones, upon his right hand an
then, having transported himself magically into the presence of the Buddha, placing it on the ground. He bowed down at the feet of the Buddha
circumambulated him to the right seven times with palms together, and withdrew to one side
The bodhisattvas who had come from the buddhafield of the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa descended from their lion-thrones and
When you enter a town, you should keep in mind its actual voidness
yet you should proceed through it in order to develop men and women
bowing down at the feet of the Buddha, placed their palms together in reverence and withdrew to one side
You should beg your food in awareness of the ultimate nonexistence of food
And the other bodhisattvas, great spiritual heroes
You should see form like a man blind from birth, hear sounds as if they were echoes
and the great disciples descended from their thrones likewise and, having bowed at the feet of the Buddha, withdrew to one side
You should seek alms for the sake of eliminating the materialism of others
and you should seek alms with consideration for all living beings at all times
‘Reverend Mahākāśyapa, to avoid the houses of the wealthy, and to favor the houses of the poor—this is partiality in benevolence. Reverend Mahākāśyapa, you should dwell on the fact of the equality of things
smell scents as if they were winds
experience tastes without any discrimination
touch tangibles in awareness of the ultimate lack of contact in gnosis
and know things with the consciousness of an illusory creature
That which is without intrinsic substance and without imparted substance does not burn
And what does not burn will not be extinguished
Likewise all those Indras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, and gods bowed at the feet of the Buddha and withdrew to one side
Then, the Buddha, having delighted those bodhisattvas with greetings, declared
“Noble sons, be seated upon your thrones!
Thus commanded by the Buddha, they took their thrones
“Lord, what is this perfume, the likes of which I have never smelled before?
Śāriputra added
“Venerable Ānanda, this same perfume emanates from all our pores as well!
And I, full of astonishment, having saluted this good man by touching his feet with my head
‘Please accept, good man, this necklace of pearls, out of compassion for me, and give it to whomsoever you wish
‘The giver who makes gifts to the lowliest poor of the city, considering them as worthy of offering as the Tathāgata himself, and the giver who gives without any discrimination, impartially, with no expectation of reward, and with great love—that giver, I say, totally fulfills the Dharma-sacrifice.
“How long will this perfume remain?
The Buddha answered, “Ānanda, this perfume emanates from all the pores of all these bodhisattvas.
and its perfume will emanate for seven days more after that
but there will be no trouble of indigestion during that time
And thus, Lord, I am reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.
Then the venerable Ānanda addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
Furthermore, reverend Ānanda, if monks who have not entered destiny for the ultimate eat this food, it will be digested when they enter that destiny
He has attained the supreme excellence of the indivisible, nondual sphere of the ultimate realm
He is skilled in teaching the Dharma with its infinite modalities within the uniform ultimate
He is skilled in granting means of attainment in accordance with the spiritual faculties of all living beings
He has thoroughly integrated his realization with skill in liberative art
They should follow the way of the buddhas, not the way of the disciples
He has attained decisiveness with regard to all questions
Only in this way, Elder Mahākāśyapa, is the practice of eating by alms meaningful.
If living beings who have not conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment eat this food, it will be digested when they conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
If those who have conceived the spirit of perfect enlightenment eat this food, it will not be digested until they have attained tolerance
Then, the venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha
“Lord, it is wonderful that this food accomplishes the work of the Buddha!
and thought, ‘Reverence to all bodhisattvas
If a lay bodhisattva may be endowed with such eloquence
Thus, although he cannot be withstood by someone of my feeble defenses, still, sustained by the grace of the Buddha, I will go to him and will converse with him as well as I can.
“Surely the conversations of the crown prince Mañjuśrī and that good man will result in a profound teaching of the Dharma.
Thereupon, in that assembly, the bodhisattvas, the great disciples, the Śakras, the Brahmās, the Lokapālas, and the gods and goddesses, all had this thought
Thus, eight thousand bodhisattvas
five hundred disciples
a great number of Śakras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, and many hundreds of thousands of gods and goddesses, all followed the crown prince Mañjuśrī to listen to the Dharma
And the crown prince Mañjuśrī, surrounded and followed by these bodhisattvas, disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, gods, and goddesses, entered the great city of Vaiśālī
Meanwhile, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought to himself
“Mañjuśrī, the crown prince, is coming here with numerous attendants. Now, may this house be transformed into emptiness!
Then, magically his house became empty. Even the doorkeeper disappeared
“ ‘Elder Mahākāśyapa, if, equipoised in the eight liberations without transcending the eight perverse paths, you can enter the sameness of reality by means of the sameness of perversity
and if you can make a gift to all living beings and an offering to all the noble ones and buddhas out of even a single measure of alms
What is seen is not to be seen again, ultimately
“Good sir, is your condition tolerable
Is it livable
who is there who would not conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment?’ From that time forth, I no longer recommend the vehicles of the disciples and of the solitary sages but recommend the Mahāyāna
Are your physical elements not disturbed
Is your sickness diminishing
Is it not increasing
The Buddha then said to the venerable Subhūti
“Householder, whence came this sickness of yours
How long will it continue
and was translated, edited, and established by the monk Chönyi Tsultrim
It has , ślokas in six fascicles
The Buddha asks about you—if you have slight trouble
“Subhūti, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
slight discomfort, slight sickness, if your distress is light, if you are cared for, strong, at ease, without self-reproach, and if you are living in touch with the supreme happiness
Subhūti replied
Who goes, ultimately goes not
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness
Who comes, ultimately comes not
Why? My Lord, I remember one day
Mañjuśrī declared, “Householder, it is as you say
when I went to beg my food at the house of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti in the great city of Vaiśālī
How does it stand
he took my bowl and filled it with some excellent food and said to me
How can it be alleviated?
Vimalakīrti replied
“Mañjuśrī, my sickness comes from ignorance and the thirst for existence and it will last as long as do the sicknesses of all living beings
Were all living beings to be free from sickness, I also would not be sick
Were all living beings free of sickness, the bodhisattva also would be free of sickness
if you can follow the path of the single way without ever disturbing the egoistic views
For example, Mañjuśrī, when the only son of a merchant is sick, both his parents become sick on account of the sickness of their son
if, neither conquering ignorance and the craving for existence, nor producing knowledge and liberation
your liberation being the same as the equality of the uninterruptible sins, you are neither liberated nor bound
if you do not see the four noble truths, yet are not one who “has not seen the truth”
if you are also neither “one who has attained fruition,” nor “an ordinary person,” while not having eliminated the qualities of “an ordinary person”
if you are not a noble one, and not a non-noble one
and if, though you are in the presence of all things, you are free of any notion of “all things.
Then the Buddha said to the venerable Ānanda
And we will protect the teachers of this Dharma for a radius of one league so that no one who plots injury or disruption against these teachers will have any opportunity to do them harm.
and how should I remember it?
if, bound up in the eight adversities, you do not obtain favorable conditions
The Buddha said
Thus spoke the Buddha
And the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
the crown prince Mañjuśrī
if, assimilating the passions, you do not attain purification
the venerable Ānanda, the bodhisattvas
the great disciples
if the dispassion of all living beings is your dispassion, reverend
if those who make offerings to you are not thereby purified
the entire multitude, and the whole universe with its gods, men, asuras
if those who offer you food, reverend, still fall into the three bad migrations
if you associate with all māras
“So it is, Ānanda
It is as you say
if you criticize all the teachings of the Buddha
“Lord, when I heard these words of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, I wondered what I should sa
and what I should do, but I was totally in the dark
You ask me, Mañjuśrī, whence comes my sickness; the sicknesses of the bodhisattvas arise from great compassion.
‘Reverend Subhūti, do not fear these words, and pick up your bowl
He becomes sick when they are sick and is cured when they are cured
What do you think, reverend Subhūti
Mañjuśrī, you ask me why I am without servants, but all māras and opponents are my servants
If it were an incarnation created by the Tathāgata who spoke thus to you, would you be afraid?’“I answered, ‘No indeed, noble sir!
He then said, ‘Reverend Subhūti, the nature of all things is like illusion, like a magical incarnation. So you should not fear them
Why? All words also have that nature
Therefore, all māras and opponents are my servants
The outsider opponents advocate convictions, and the bodhisattva is not troubled by convictions
his remembrance of suffering experienced from beginningless time
if you have hostile feelings toward all living beings; if you despise all the buddhas
He should encourage his empathy for all living beings on account of his own sickness
if you entertain all passions; if the nature of passions is the nature of a reverend
if, entertaining all false views, you find neither extremes nor middle
that the body is selfless, but that living beings should be developed; that the body is peaceful, but not to seek any ultimate calm
I should free myself from this sickness and should strive to abandon it.
and this misunderstanding is also a grave sickness
‘Just as in the case of the conception of “self,” so the conception of “thing” is also a misunderstanding
“Furthermore, he should understand thoroughly the conception of himself as a thing by cultivating the following consideration
Through such considerations, he arouses the great compassion toward all living beings without falling into any sentimental compassion
but instead, arouses great compassion toward all living beings through striving to eliminate the incidental afflictions
and thus the wise are not attached to words, nor do they fear them
Why? All language does not ultimately exist
He does not reincarnate through involvement with such views but reincarnates with his mind free of involvement
except as liberation
The liberation of liberative art integrated with wisdom consists of the bodhisattva’s dedication of his roots of virtue for the sake of enlightenment, without taking any pride therein, while forgoing all convictions, passions, attachments, resentments, and their subconscious instincts
The nature of all things is liberation.
“Not the domain of the ordinary individual and not the domain of the arhat, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
As for me, I was speechless and unable to respond to him
Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.
The Buddha then said to the venerable Pūrṇa­maitrāyaṇī­putra
“Pūrṇa, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
Pūrṇa replied
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness
Why? Lord, I remember one day
when I was teaching the Dharma to some young monks in the great forest, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me
‘Reverend Pūrṇa, first concentrate yourself, regard the minds of these young bhikṣus, and then teach them the Dharma
Do not put rotten food into a jeweled bowl
“Reverend Śāriputra, the Dharma is calm and peaceful
First understand the inclinations of these monks, and do not confuse priceless sapphires with glass beads
Those who are engaged in production and destruction are not interested in the Dharma, are not interested in solitude, but are interested in production and destruction
“Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, the Dharma is without taint and free of defilement
He who is attached to anything, even to liberation, is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in the taint of desire
The Dharma is not an object
He who pursues objects is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in objects
“ ‘Reverend Pūrṇa, without examining the spiritual faculties of living beings, do not presume upon the one-sidedness of their faculties
He who holds on to things or lets go of things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in holding and letting go
The Dharma is not a secure refuge
do not wound those who are without wounds
He who enjoys a secure refuge is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in a secure refuge
The Dharma is without sign
He whose consciousness pursues signs is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in signs
The Dharma is not a society
do not impose a narrow path upon those who aspire to a great path
He who seeks to associate with the Dharma is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in association
do not try to pour the great ocean into the hoof-print of an ox
The Dharma is not a sight, a sound, a category, or an idea
do not try to put Mount Sumeru into a grain of mustard
He who is involved in sights, sounds, categories, and ideas is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in sights, sounds, categories, and ideas
do not confuse the brilliance of the sun with the light of a glowworm
and do not expose those who admire the roar of a lion to the howl of a jackal
“ ‘Reverend Pūrṇa, all these monks were formerly engaged in the Mahāyāna but have forgotten the spirit of enlightenment
The disciple vehicle is not ultimately valid
and you disciples are like men blind from birth, in regard to recognition of the degrees of the spiritual faculties of living beings.
Ānanda, among all the activities, enjoyments, and practices of the buddhas
“At that moment, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti entered into such a concentration that those monks were caused to remember their various former lives
in which they had produced the roots of virtue by serving five hundred buddhas for the sake of perfect enlightenment
Reverend Śāriputra, the Dharma is free of compounded things and uncompounded things
He taught them the Dharma, and they all attained the stage of irreversibility from unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
He who adheres to compounded things and uncompounded things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in adhering to compounded things and uncompounded things
“Thereupon, reverend Śāriputra, if you are interested in the Dharma, you should take no interest in anything.
‘The disciples, who do not know the thoughts or the inclinations of others, are not able to teach the Dharma to anyone
When Vimalakīrti had spoken this discourse, five hundred gods obtained the purity of the Dharma-eye in viewing all things
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince, Mañjuśrī
and they are not always in a state of concentration like the Tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly accomplished Buddha.
Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his health.
The Buddha then said to the venerable Mahākātyāyana
“Kātyāyana, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
The bodhisattvas there are forty-two hundred thousand leagues tall and their own thrones are thirty-four hundred thousand leagues high. 
after the Lord had given some brief instruction to the monks
Noble sir, the finest and most superb thrones exist in that universe Merudhvaja, which is the buddhafield of the Tathāgata Meru­pradīpa­rāja.
“Ānanda, this is a Dharma-door called introduction to all the buddha-qualities
The meaning of the realization of birthlessness, through the realization of the voidness of the five aggregates, is the meaning of “suffering.
The fact of the nonduality of self and selflessness is the meaning of “selflessness.
That which has no intrinsic substance and no other sort of substance does not burn
“When he had discoursed thus, the minds of the monks were liberated from their defilements and entered a state of nongrasping
Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
The Buddha then said to the venerable Aniruddha
The thirty-two hundred thousand thrones arranged themselves without crowding and the house seemed to enlarge itself accordingly
The great city of Vaiśālī did not become obscured; neither did the land of Jambudvīpa, nor the world of four continents
“My Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
“Mañjuśrī, let the bodhisattvas be seated on these thrones, having transformed their bodies to a suitable size!
Then, those bodhisattvas who had attained the superknowledges transformed their bodies to a height of forty-two hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thrones
Why? I remember, Lord, one da
But the beginner bodhisattvas were not able to transform themselves to sit upon the thrones
‘Friends, I see the entire billion-world galactic universe of the Lord Śākyamun
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti taught these beginner bodhisattvas a teaching that enabled them to attain the five superknowledges
and, having attained them, they transformed their bodies to a height of forty-two hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thrones
But still the great disciples were not able to seat themselves upon the thrones
‘Reverend Aniruddha, you have been proclaimed by the Buddha to be the foremost among those who possess the divine eye
having bowed their heads at my feet, withdrew to one side and asked me
Then, the great disciples bowed down to the Tathāgata Meru­pradīpa­rāja and they were seated upon the thrones
Then, the venerable Śāriputra said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
‘Reverend Aniruddha, is your divine eye compounded in nature
Or is it uncompounded in nature
If it is compounded in nature, it is the same as the superknowledges of the outsiders
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti replied
“Reverend Śāriputra, for the tathāgatas and the bodhisattvas, there is a liberation called ‘inconceivable.
The bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can put the king of mountains, Sumeru, which is so high, so great, so noble, and so vast, into a mustard seed
That, reverend Śāriputra, is an entrance to the domain of the inconceivable liberation of the bodhisattvas
Only those beings who are destined to be disciplined by miracles see and understand the putting of the king of mountains, Sumeru, into the mustard seed
He can perform this feat without enlarging the mustard seed and without shrinking Mount Sumeru
And the deities of the assembly of the four Mahārājas and of the Trayastriṃśa heavens do not even know where they are
“Thus, a bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can manifest all the splendors of the virtues of all the buddhafields within a single buddhafield
and those disciplined by a short period of evolution actually perceive an eon to be the passing of a week
The living beings who are disciplined through an immeasurable period of evolution actually perceive a week to be the passing of an eon
and there are also those who are disciplined after a short period of evolution
“Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, there are beings who become disciplined after an immense period of evolution
And the whole operation is visible without any injury or disturbance to any of those living beings
without injuring the water-animals such as fish, tortoises, crocodiles, frogs, and other creatures, and without the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras even being aware of where they are
“Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, the bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can pour into a single pore of his skin all the waters of the four great oceans
Ānanda, you should remain in equanimity with regard to the deeds of the bodhisattvas
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
The passions do indeed constitute the family of the tathāgatas
How can such as we, the disciples, conceive the spirit of enlightenment, or become fully enlightened in regard to the qualities of the Buddha
The Buddha then said to the venerable Upāli
They cannot be fathomed even by the wisest of men
Ānanda, look at the bodhisattvas
“Therefore, Mañjuśrī, the ordinary individual is grateful to the Tathāgata, but the disciples are not grateful
Thus, the disciples can never appreciate those qualities
“Do not be discouraged, Ānanda
The Buddha said
in the same way all the qualities of the Buddha have no impression or effect on the disciples, who have abandoned all adherence
“Just as the five desire objects have no impression or effect on those bereft of faculties
“Lord, from this day forth, I shall no longer declare myself to be the foremost of the learned.
Just as, noble sir, without going out into the great ocean, it is impossible to find precious, priceless pearls
” Then, the venerable Ānanda addressed the Buddha
As for me, I remained speechless, and therefore I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
Noble sir, through these considerations one can understand that all passions constitute the family of the tathāgatas
Having paid homage and respect both to me and to that good man, they disappeared
and the wisdom and the eloquence of the tathāgatas are inconceivable
Thus, Ānanda, the enlightenment of the buddhas is immeasurable
Likewise, as seeds do not grow in the sky but do grow in the earth
“Having heard these words, the ten thousand Brahmās were inspired with high resolve and conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Just so, the buddha-qualities do not grow in living beings certainly destined for the uncreated but do grow in those living beings who are like swamps and mud banks of passions
their development and liberation of living beings
Their driver is the spirit of enlightenment‌
Their vehicle is the unexcelled Mahāyāna
They see all the buddhafields without even leaving their state of concentration and without being affected by duality.
‘In the world, it is the buddhas who have the divine eye
and Brahmā also was amazed to hear this teaching from that good man. Having bowed to him, he said
Venerable Upāli, kindly remove our anxieties by absolving us of these infractions.
‘Reverend Upāli, do not aggravate further the sins of these two monks
Without perplexing them, relieve their remorse
Reverend Upāli, sin is not to be apprehended within, or without, or between the two
“Living beings are afflicted by the passions of thought
and they are purified by the purification of thought.
He considers peacefulness but does not seek extreme peace
He cherishes solitude but does not avoid mental and physical efforts
nor is it to be apprehended between the two
and he can make the passing of an eon seem like the passing of a week for those who are disciplined through a short period of evolution
The bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation, for the sake of disciplining those living beings who are disciplined through immeasurable periods of evolution, can make the passing of a week seem like the passing of an eon
He considers placelessness but does not abandon the place of good actions
He can display in a single pore all the offerings ever offered to all the buddhas of the ten directions, and the orbs of all the suns, moons, and stars of the ten directions
He considers occurrencelessness but undertakes to bear the burdens of all living beings
He considers immaculateness, yet he follows the process of the world
without letting the forests and the grasses of the buddhafields be flattened
He can inhale all the hurricanes of the cosmic wind-atmospheres of the ten directions into his mouth without harming his own body an
He can take all the masses of fire of all the supernovas that ultimately consume all the universes of all the buddhafields into his stomach without interfering with their functions
Having crossed buddhafields as numerous as the sands of the Ganges downward, and having taken up a buddhafield
Sin is just the same as the mind
and all things are just the same as sin
he can rise up through buddhafields as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and place it on high, just as a strong man may pick up a jujube leaf on the point of a needle
They do not escape this same reality
“ ‘Reverend Upāli, this nature of the mind
through thorough analysis with his wisdom, he does not destroy compounded things
by virtue of which your mind, reverend, is liberated—does it ever become afflicted?
“ ‘Never,’ I replied
To purify the buddhafield, he does not rest in the uncompounded
Out of skill in liberative art, he does not rest in the uncompounded, and
to perfect the gnosis of omniscience, he does not destroy compounded things
To perfect the marks of buddhahood, he does not rest in the uncompounded, and
“ ‘Reverend Upāli, the minds of all living beings have that very nature
“Thus, a bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can magically transform any kind of living being into a universal monarch, a Lokapāla, a Śakra, a Brahmā, a disciple, a solitary sage, a bodhisattva, and even into a buddha
And he can cause them to recite the words and sounds of all the teachings taught by all the buddhas of the ten directions
Reverend Upāli, conceptualization is total affliction, and not conceptualizin
and not discriminating is their true nature
Misapprehension is total affliction
in order to aspire to the buddha-qualities, he does not destroy compounded things
“Reverend Śāriputra, I have shown you only a small part of the entrance into the domain of the bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation
Reverend Śāriputra, to explain to you the teaching of the full entrance into the domain of the bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation would require more than an eon, and even more than that.
In order to develop living beings, he does not rest in the uncompounded, and
in order to fulfill the great compassion, he does not destroy compounded things
In order to fulfill the great love, he does not rest in the uncompounded, and
in order to accomplish the store of wisdom, he does not destroy the compounded
“Furthermore, noble sons, in order to accomplish the store of merit, a bodhisattva does not rest in the uncompounded, and
“Thus, noble sons, a bodhisattva who aspires to such a Dharma neither rests in the uncompounded nor destroys the compounded
and non-misapprehension is their true nature
The presumption of self is total affliction
“Good sir, how should a bodhisattva regard all living beings?
and selflessness is their true nature
Reverend Upāli, all things are without production, destruction, and duration
like magical illusions, clouds, and lightning
all things are evanescent
not remaining even for an instant; all things are like dreams, hallucinations
and unreal visions
all things are like the reflection of the moon in water and like a mirror-image
they are born of mental construction
Those who know this are called the true upholders of the discipline
and those disciplined in that way are indeed well disciplined.’ 
“Then the two monks said
‘This householder is extremely well endowed with wisdom
The reverend Upāli, who was proclaimed by the Lord as the foremost of the upholders of the discipline, is not his equal.
“I then said to the two monks
‘Do not entertain the notion that he is a mere householder
or rivaling the brilliance of his wisdom.
“Thereupon, the two monks, delivered from their anxieties and inspired with a high resolve, conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Bowing down to that good man, they made the wish: ‘May all living beings attain eloquence such as this!
The Buddha then said to the venerable Rāhula
“Rāhula, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
Rāhula replied
“Precisely thus, Mañjuśrī, does a bodhisattva who realizes ultimate selflessness consider all beings.
the love that accords with reality because it is the very same in all three times
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
the love that is without conflict because free of the violence of the passions
the love that is nondual because it is involved neither with the external nor with the internal
the love that is imperturbable because totally ultimate
‘Reverend Rāhula, you are the son of the Lord
and, having renounced a kingdom of a universal monarch, you have left the world
the arhat’s love that has eliminated its enemy
the bodhisattva’s love that continuously develops living beings
What are the virtues and benefits you saw in leaving the world?
the Tathāgata’s love that understands reality
the Buddha’s love that causes living beings to awaken from their sleep
the love that is spontaneous because it is fully enlightened spontaneously
“As I was teaching them properly the benefits and virtues of renouncing the world
the love that is never exhausted because it acknowledges voidness and selflessness
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and, having greeted me, said
‘Reverend Rāhula, you should not teach the benefits and virtues of renunciation in the way that you do
the love that is great compassion because it infuses the Mahāyāna with radiance
Likewise, venerable Śāriputra, when this door of the inconceivable liberation is taught, all the disciples and solitary sages are sightless, like the man blind from birth
and cannot comprehend even a single cause of the inconceivable liberation
Who is there among the wise who, hearing about this inconceivable liberation, does not conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Reverend Rāhula, one may speak of benefits and virtues in regard to compounded things, but renunciation is uncompounded
and there can be no question of benefits and virtues in regard to the uncompounded
Reverend Rāhula, renunciation is not material but is free of matter
It is free of the extreme views of beginning and end
As for us, whose faculties are deteriorated, like a burned and rotten seed, what else can we do if we do not become receptive to this great vehicle
He considers birthlessness, yet he does not fall into the ultimate determination of the disciples
It is the path of liberation
It is praised by the wise
embraced by the noble ones, and causes the defeat of all māras
It liberates from the five states of existence
purifies the five eyes
cultivates the five powers
and supports the five spiritual faculties
Renunciation is totally harmless to others and is not adulterated with evil things
It disciplines the outsiders, transcending all denominations
It is the bridge over the swamp of desire
by the power of the grace of the Buddha, he does not destroy compounded things
Because he feels the needs of living beings, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and, in order to show truly the meaning of the Dharma, he does not destroy compounded things
without grasping
Because of his store of roots of virtue, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and free of the habits of “I” and “mine.
and, because of his instinctive enthusiasm for these roots of virtue, he does not destroy compounded things
To fulfill his prayers, he does not rest in the uncompounded
It is without attachment and without disturbance, eliminating all commotion
and, because he has no wishes, he does not destroy compounded things
We, all the disciples and solitary sages, upon hearing this teaching of the Dharma, should utter a cry of regret that would shake this billion-world galactic universe
Because his positive thought is pure, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and, because his high resolve is pure, he does not destroy compounded things
In order to play with the five superknowledges, he does not rest in the uncompounded
It disciplines one’s own mind and protects the minds of others
and, because of the six superknowledges of the buddha-gnosis, he does not destroy compounded things
“The young men complained
To be a human being is very precious.
Human life endowed with leisure and opportunity is very hard to obtain
The appearance of the Buddha is extremely rare
Young men, renounce the world in the light of this clear teaching
To fulfill the six transcendences, he does not rest in the uncompounded
Those who leave the mundane in this way are called “truly renunciant.
Indeed, what could the entire host of māras ever do to one who is devoted to this inconceivable liberation?
and, to fulfill the time, he does not destroy compounded things
To gather the treasures of the Dharma, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and, because he does not like any narrow-minded teachings, he does not destroy compounded things
Because he gathers all the medicines of the Dharma, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and, to apply the medicine of the Dharma appropriately, he does not destroy compounded things
And as for the bodhisattvas, when they hear this inconceivable liberation they should be as joyful as a young crown prince when he takes the diadem and is anointed, and they should increase to the utmost their devotion to this inconceivable liberation
To confirm his commitments, he does not rest in the uncompounded
“Lord, as soon as the householder had discoursed thus, two hundred brahmins among the crowd of brahmins present conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
and, to mend any failure of these commitments, he does not destroy compounded things
‘But, householder, we have heard the Tathāgata declare that one should not renounce the world without the permission of one’s parents.
To concoct all the medicines of the Dharma, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and, to give out the medicine of even the smallest Dharma, he does not destroy compounded things
‘Young men, you should cultivate yourselves intensively to conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Because he knows thoroughly all the sicknesses due to passions, he does not rest in the uncompounded
and, in order to cure all sicknesses of all living beings, he does not destroy compounded things
That in itself will be your renunciation and high ordination!
“Thus, noble sons, the bodhisattva does not destroy compounded things and does not rest in the uncompounded
and that is the liberation of bodhisattvas called destructible and indestructible
“Thereupon, thirty-two of the Licchavi youths conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
Noble sirs, you should also strive in this.
The Buddha then said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
Then, those bodhisattvas, having heard this teaching, were satisfied
Ānanda replied, “Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
delighted, and reverent. They were filled with rejoicing and happiness of mind
I took the bowl and went to the door of the mansion of a great brahmin family
manifested herself in a material body and showered the great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas, and the great disciples with heavenly flowers
When the flowers fell on the bodies of the bodhisattvas, they fell off on the floor, but when they fell on the bodies of the great disciples, they stuck to them and did not fall
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there, and, having saluted me, said
‘Reverend Ānanda, what are you doing on the threshold of this house with your bowl in your hand so early in the morning?
“I replied
One who is without such thoughts is always proper
“Reverend Śāriputra, impropriety for one who has renounced the world for the discipline of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual thought and discrimination, yet the elders are full of such thoughts
Having thus regaled the whole retinue of the Tathāgata, bowed their heads at the feet of the Buddha
and circumambulated him to the right three times, they sang a hymn of praise to him
‘Reverend Ānanda, do not say such a thing
Transcending the scope of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, he is not produced in the six sense-media
Reverend Ānanda, the body of the Tathāgata is tough as a diamond
Like the element of space, he does not abide in any of the four elements
yet he is not consciousness
He is the essence that is the reality of consciousness
yet he is not performance
having eliminated all the instinctual traces of evil and being endowed with all goodness. How could disease or discomfort affect such a body
He is the essence that is the reality of performance
“ ‘Reverend Ānanda, go in silence, and do not belittle the Lord
Do not say such things to others
It would not be good for the powerful gods or for the bodhisattvas coming from the various buddhafields to hear such words
“ ‘Reverend Ānanda, a universal monarch, who is endowed only with a small root of virtue, is free of diseases
but he is not intellect
He is the essence that is the reality of intellect
but he is not sensation
He is the essence that is the reality of sensation
but he is not matter
The Dharma is without acceptance or rejection
and not abiding in the present time
not passing on to the future
I see him as not born from the past
“Lord, when I see the Tathāgata, I view him by not seeing any Tathāgata
How then could the Lord, who has an infinite root of virtue, have any disease
It is impossible
“Noble son, when you see the Tathāgata, how do you view him?
Thereupon, the Buddha said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
They then disappeared from this univers
and in a split second were back in the universe Sarva­gandha­sugandhā
“Lord, such was my conversation with the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
Therefore, Ānanda, do not be ashamed, and go and get the milk!
Nevertheless, since the Buddha has appeared during the time of the five corruptions, he disciplines living beings by acting lowly and humble
Then I heard a voice from the sky: ‘Ānanda! The householder speaks to you truly
and I was very much ashamed
“When I had heard these words, I wondered if I had previously misheard and misunderstood the Buddha
Reverend Ānanda, to believe there can be illness in such a body is irrational and unseemly
The body of a tathāgata is uncompounded and free of all formative activity
There is no injury to the body of a tathāgata, as it is rid of all defilements
“ ‘Reverend Ānanda, the tathāgatas have the body of the Dharma
not a body that is sustained by material food
The tathāgatas have a transcendental body that has transcended all mundane qualities
neither concentration nor distraction
neither wisdom nor foolishness
Reverend Ānanda, go then discreetly so that no one observes you
so the buddha-qualities do not grow in those determined for the absolute but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment, after having produced a Sumeru-like mountain of egoistic views
He is neither truth nor falsehood
neither escape from the world nor failure to escape from the world
The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Maitreya
neither cause of involvement in the world nor not a cause of involvement in the world
“Maitreya, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
Maitreya replied
neither effort nor sloth
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
neither tolerance nor malice
neither morality nor immorality
Why? Lord, I remember tha
He cannot be explained as having any meaning whatsoever
He is neither compounded nor uncompounde
but the disciples, although they may hear of the qualities, powers, and fearlessnesses of the Buddha until the end of their days, are not capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment.
Thereupon, the bodhisattva Sarva­rūpa­saṃdarśana, who was present in that assembly, addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
He lives in no country or direction. He is neither good nor evil
He is neither weak nor strong
He is neither name nor sign
He is neither darkness nor light
nor is he inherent in consciousness
He cannot be discovered by consciousness
“Householder, where are your father and mother, your children, your wife, your servants, your maids, your laborers, and your attendants
Where are your friends, your relatives, and your kinsmen
Where are your servants, your horses, your elephants, your chariots, your bodyguards, and your bearers?
Thus addressed, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti spoke the following verses to the bodhisattva Sarva­rūpa­saṃdarśana
“Of the true bodhisattvas
The mother is the transcendence of wisdom
The father is the skill in liberative technique
“Their wife is the joy in the Dharma
Love and compassion are their daughters
The Dharma and the truth are their sons
And their home is deep thought on the meaning of voidness
“All the passions are their disciples, Controlled at will
“The Tathāgata is neither generosity nor avarice
“ ‘Maitreya, the Buddha has prophesied that only one more birth stands between you and unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
“Their companions, ever with them, Are the six transcendences
“The incantations make their garden, Which blossoms with the flowers of the factors of enlightenment
If your enlightenment can be prophesied in such a way, so can that of all living beings
Your reality as prophesied is not born and does not cease, nor will it be born nor will it cease
The leaders are born of such parents
And their path is the eightfold peace
“Their ornaments are the auspicious signs And the eighty marks
“Bhikṣus, in a single moment, you are born, you age, you die, you transmigrate, and you are reborn.
“Their bed consists of the four contemplations, And its spread is the pure livelihood
What kind of birth does this prophecy concern, Maitreya
Their great income is pure practice, And it is dedicated to the supreme enlightenment
Their garland is virtuous aspiration, And their clothing is good conscience and consideration
“Their wealth is the holy Dharma, And their business is its teaching
Their awakening consists of gnosis, Which is constant learning and meditation
“Their food is the ambrosia of the teachings, And their drink is the juice of liberation
Their bath is pure aspiration, And morality their unguent and perfume
Maitreya, whenever you attain buddhahood, which is the perfection of enlightenment, at the same time all living beings will also attain buddhahood
“Having conquered the enemy afflictions, They are the invincible heroes
he is the cessation of all theory and all practice
Having subdued the four māras, They raise their standard on the field of enlightenment
“Noble sir, where did you die to reincarnate here?
“They manifest birth voluntarily, Yet they are not born, nor do they originate
Then the venerable Śāriputra asked the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
They shine in all the fields of the buddhas, Just like the rising sun
The Buddha said
“Though they worship buddhas by the millions, With every conceivable offering, They never dwell upon the least difference Between the buddhas and themselves
“Śāriputra, ask this good man directly where he died to reincarnate here.
“Lord, in which buddhafield did the noble Vimalakīrti die, before reincarnating in this buddhafield?
The venerable Śāriputra then asked the Buddha
Who sees otherwise, sees falsely.
Who sees thus, truly sees
“Although they recognize the deeds of māras, They can get along even with these māras
“Such is the body of the Tathāgata and thus should he be seen
No verbal teaching can express him
“They play with illusory manifestations In order to develop living beings, Showing themselves to be old or sick, And even manifesting their own deaths
and without strain
For even such activities may be manifested By those perfected in liberative art
without joy
he is without sorrow
“They demonstrate the burning of the earth In the consuming flames of the world’s end, In order to demonstrate impermanence To living beings convinced about permanence
Maitreya, at the moment when you attain ultimate liberation, all living beings will also attain ultimate liberation
He is without fear and without subconsciousness
For, since all living beings are utterly liberated, the tathāgatas see them as having the nature of ultimate liberation
“ ‘Therefore, Maitreya, do not fool and delude these deities
They partake of offerings at the homes of all
And dedicate all for the sake of enlightenment
No one abides in, or regresses from, enlightenment
Maitreya, you should introduce these deities to the repudiation of all discriminative constructions concerning enlightenment
“ ‘Enlightenment is perfectly realized neither by the body nor by the mind
Enlightenment is the eradication of all marks
Enlightenment is free of presumptions concerning all objects
“By devoting themselves as monks To all the strange sects of the world, They develop all those beings Who have attached themselves to dogmatic views
Enlightenment is free of the functioning of all intentional thoughts
Enlightenment is the annihilation of all convictions
Enlightenment is free from all discriminative constructions
“They may become suns or moons, Indras, Brahmās, or lords of creatures; They may become fire or water Or earth or wind
Enlightenment is free from all vacillation, mentation, and agitation
Enlightenment is not involved in any commitments
He is without reproach
Enlightenment is the arrival at detachment, through freedom from all habitual attitudes
without excess
“During the short eons of maladies, They become the best holy medicine; They make beings well and happy, And bring about their liberation
without corruption
“During the short eons of famine, They become food and drink. Having first alleviated thirst and hunger, They teach the Dharma to living beings
“During the short eons of swords, They meditate on love, Introducing to nonviolence Hundreds of millions of living beings
Equal toward all things, he does not discriminate between them
having attained the equanimity of omniscient gnosis
“In order to help living beings, They voluntarily descend Into the hells which are attached To all the inconceivable buddhafields
“They manifest their lives In all the species of the animal kingdom, Teaching the Dharma everywhere
He is neither a field of merit nor not a field of merit
he is neither worthy of offerings nor unworthy of offerings
Thus they are called ‘leaders.
He is not an object
and cannot be contacted
The ground of enlightenment is the ultimate realm
“They display sensual enjoyment to the worldlings, And trances to the meditative
They completely conquer the māras, And allow them no chance to prevail
Enlightenment is realization of reality
Enlightenment abides at the reality-limit
Enlightenment is without duality, since therein are no minds and no things
Enlightenment is equality, since it is equal to infinite space
“Just as displaying a lotus Amidst a fire is miraculous, So they display the miracles Of both pleasures and trances
“In order to help living beings, They always become chieftains, Captains, priests, and ministers, Or even prime ministers
“ ‘Enlightenment is unconstructed, because it is neither born nor destroyed, neither abides nor undergoes any transformation
“For the sake of the poor, They become inexhaustible treasures, Causing those to whom they give their gifts To conceive the spirit of enlightenmen
does not pass beyond
He does not go, does not stay
Enlightenment is not a door for the sense-media
Enlightenment is unadulterated, since it is free of the afflictions of the instinctually driven succession of lives
Enlightenment is neither somewhere nor nowhere, abiding in no location or dimension
Enlightenment is merely a name and even that name is motionless
Thus the attainment of the tolerance of the birthlessness of things is the entrance into nonduality.
Enlightenment, not being contained in anything, does not stand in reality
If there is no presumption of a self, there will be no possessiveness
Enlightenment, free of abstention and undertaking, is energyless
Thus, the absence of presumption is the entrance into nonduality.
There is no agitation in enlightenment, as it is utterly pure by nature
“Noble sir, production and destruction are two, but what is not produced and does not occur cannot be destroyed
Enlightenment is radiance, pure in essence
Enlightenment is without subjectivity and completely without object
Enlightenment, which penetrates the equality of all things, is undifferentiated
“Lord, the beautiful teachings of the Tathāgata are wonderful and truly excellent
Lord, from this time forth, I will avoid all such errors an
will defend and uphold this attainment of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment by the Tathāgata during innumerable hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of eons
The bodhisattva Dharmavikurvaṇa declared
“Even for the buddhas themselves, During a million eons, Or even a hundred million eons
It would be hard to express all their virtues
Having perfected an infinite wisdom, They liberate an infinity of living beings
Enlightenment, which is not shown by any example, is incomparable
“Their practices are infinite; And their spheres of influence are infinite
Enlightenment is subtle, since it is extremely difficult to realize
Enlightenment is all-pervasive, as it has the nature of infinite space
Enlightenment cannot be realized, either physically or mentally
And the mind is immaterial, invisible, baseless, and unconscious.
“Lord, when Vimalakīrti had discoursed thus, two hundred of the deities in that assembly attained the tolerance of the birthlessness of things
As for me, Lord, I was rendered speechless
Then the four Mahārājas, the great kings of the quarters, said to the Buddha
Therefore, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
The Buddha then said to the young Licchavi Prabhāvyūh
“Prabhāvyūha, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
He surpasses all calculations
He is utterly unequaled
Prabhāvyūha replied
He surpasses all measure
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
when I was going out of the great city of Vaiśālī
I met the Licchavi Vimalakīrti coming in
He greeted me, and I then addressed him
‘Householder, where do you come from?’ He replied
‘I come from the seat of enlightenment.
I then inquired
“ ‘It is the seat of interdependent origination, because it proceeds from the exhaustion of ignorance to the exhaustion of old age and death
It is the seat of truth, because it does not deceive anyone
It is the seat of the aids to enlightenment, because it eliminates the duality of the compounded and the uncompounded
It is the seat of decisiveness, because of its precise discrimination
It is the seat of learning, because it makes practice of the essence
It is the seat of the means of unification, because it brings together living beings
It is the seat of liberative art, because it develops living beings
It is the seat of liberation, because it does not intellectualize
“ ‘It is the seat of paranormal perception, because it has the six superknowledges
Reverend Śāriputra, if one were to ask a man or woman created by a magician where he or she had died to reincarnate there, what do you think he or she would answer
It is the seat of equanimity, because it abandons affection and aversion
It is the seat of joy, because it is joyfully devoted to the bliss of the Dharma
It is the seat of compassion, because it tolerates all injuries
“ ‘It is the seat of love, because it is equal to all living beings
It is the seat of wisdom, because it sees everything directly
It is the seat of meditation, because it generates fitness of mind
Reverend Śāriputra, “death” is an end of performance, and “rebirth” is the continuation of performance
It is the seat of effort, because it does not turn back
But, although a bodhisattva dies, he does not put an end to the performance of the roots of virtue
It is the seat of tolerance, because it is free of anger toward any living being
and although he is reborn, he does not adhere to the continuation of sin
It is the seat of morality, because it fulfills all commitments
Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Śāriputra
“ ‘It is the seat of generosity, because it has no expectation of reward
It is the seat of the great spirit of enlightenment, because it does not neglect anything
It is the seat of high resolve, because its insight is superior
It is the seat of effort, because it releases energetic activities
‘Noble son, the seat of enlightenment is the seat of positive thought because it is without artificiality
He then spoke the following words to me
‘What is meant by “seat of enlightenment”?
It is the seat of eradication of all afflictions, because it is perfectly enlightened about the nature of reality
Since they do not associate with the afflictions, they dispel the darkness of the afflictions of all living beings
Noble sir, those two do not go together
the tree of enlightenment of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya
and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya himself, seated in the middle of an assembly vast as an ocean, teaching the Dharma
“Śāriputra, this holy person came here from the presence of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya in the universe Abhirati.
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti said
its Brahmā and his retinues
“Śāriputra, what do you think
As soon as the sun rises, all darkness is destroyed
It is the seat of all living beings, because all living beings are without intrinsic identity
It is the seat of all things, because it is perfectly enlightened with regard to voidness
“ ‘It is the seat of the conquest of all devils, because it never flinches
It is the seat of the triple world, because it is free of involvement
It is the seat of the heroism that sounds the lion’s roar, because it is free of fear and trembling
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
its Mount Sumeru and other hills and mountain ranges
its rivers, lakes, fountains, streams, oceans, and other bodies of water
its abodes of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras, bounded by its Cakravāḍa mountains
its hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas
Jagatindhara replied
The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Jagatindhara
Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought
“Jagatindhara, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
Therefore, Lord, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
“Noble son, this multitude wishes to behold the universe Abhirati and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya—show them!
and I became speechless
The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of the entire multitude, said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
“Lord, it is difficult to attend upon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti. He is gifted with marvelous eloquence concerning the law of the profound
“Lord, when Vimalakīrti had explained this teaching
five hundred gods and men conceived the spirit of enlightenment
They come from the qualities of the Buddha, and stand on the qualities of the Buddha.
“ ‘Noble son, when bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the transcendences
It is the seat of instantaneous, total understanding of all things, because it realizes fully the gnosis of omniscience
It is the seat of the three knowledges, because in it no passions remain
It is the seat of the strengths, the fearlessnesses, and all the special qualities of the Buddha, because it is irreproachable in all respects
Why? Lord, I remember that one day, when I was at home
Lord, and thus it may be known that in that future time those who believe in this teaching and who enter deeply into it will be sustained by the supernatural blessing of the bodhisattva Maitreya.
Thereupon the Buddha gave his approval to the bodhisattva Maitreya: “Excellent! Excellent
May all noble sons and daughters believe in that!
The Tathāgata rejoices and commends your good promise.
Then all the bodhisattvas said together in one voice
“Lord, we also, after the ultimate liberation of the Tathāgata
will come from our various buddhafields to spread far and wide this enlightenment of the perfect Buddha, the Tathāgata
Having saluted me by touching my feet with his head, he withdrew with his retinue to one side
I then, thinking he was Śakra, the king of the gods, said to him
‘Welcome, O Kauśika
The first gesture is to believe in all sorts of phrases and words
and the second gesture is to penetrate exactly the profound principle of the Dharma without being afraid
You should remain consciously aware in the midst of the pleasures of desire
You should often think on impermanence and strive to utilize the essential in body, life, and wealth.
Such are the two gestures of the bodhisattvas
“Then Māra was even more frightened and, much against his will, gave the heavenly maidens
and only then will you be able to return to your own abode.
‘Evil One, give these heavenly maidens to the good man Vimalakīrti
Then a voice resounded in the sky, saying
thinking that the Licchavi Vimalakīrti had come to expose him
He tried to make himself invisible, but, try as he might with all his magical powers, he could not vanish from sight
“Then Māra was terrified and distressed
“Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to Māra
‘Evil Māra, since these heavenly maidens are not suitable for this religious devotee, a son of the Śākya, give them to me.
This is not Indra but the evil Māra, who has come to ridicule you.
It is not proper for me to have these maidens.
“No sooner had I said these words than the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me
‘‌Noble son, do not think that this is Indra
“I replied, ‘O Kauśika, do not offer me, who am religious and a son of the Śākya, things which are not appropriate
‘Good sir, accept from me these twelve thousand divine maidens and make them your servants.
“Māra then said to me
“Maitreya, there are two reasons that beginner bodhisattvas hurt themselve
and do not concentrate on the profound Dharma
“Maitreya, there are two gestures of the bodhisattvas. What are they
These are the two reasons the beginner bodhisattvas hurt themselves and do not penetrate the profound Dharma
and will not quickly attain the tolerance of the ultimate birthlessness of all things.
Having been thus taught, the bodhisattva Maitreya said to the Buddha
They help living beings by means of material gifts and do not help them by means of the gift of the Dharma
Such, Maitreya, are the two reasons the bodhisattvas who aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselve
and gandharvas, rejoiced exceedingly
All heartily praised these declarations by the Lord
Nonoccurrence and nondestruction are the entrance into nonduality.
This completes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra “The Teaching of Vimalakīrti.
In the future, I will place in the hands of noble sons and noble daughters who are worthy vessels of the holy Dharma this profound teaching
“The Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having received the goddesses, said to them
‘Now that you have been given to me by Māra, you should all conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.
“He then exhorted them with discourse suitable for their development toward enlightenment, and soon they conceived the spirit of enlightenment
As the Lord declares: ‘It is not possible for one who is himself bound to deliver others from their bondage
Thus, the entrance into this principle of uniqueness is the entrance into nonduality.
Being reincarnated as if being liberated, he has the power and ability to teach the Dharma that liberates living beings from their bondage
He then said to them, ‘You have just conceived the spirit of enlightenment
From now on, you should devote yourselves to finding joy in the pleasures of the Dharma, and should take no pleasure in desires.
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti, aware of what the venerable Śāriputra was thinking, spoke to him
“They then asked him, ‘What is “joy in the pleasures of the Dharma”?
But some of the disciples had already had the thought
It is the joy of exploration of the three doors of liberation
It is the joy of the liberation of non-intimidation when hearing the profound teaching
It is the joy of accumulating all virtues, in order to cultivate the auspicious marks and signs
“I have seen them, Lord.
And if those who have attained tolerance eat this food, it will be digested when they have become bodhisattvas one lifetime away from buddhahood
Reverend Ānanda, it is like the medicine called “delicious,” which reaches the stomach but is not digested until all poisons have been eliminated—only then is it digested
It is the joy of the superior gladness of faith and devotion to the Dharma
Thus, the bodhisattva admires and finds joy in the delights of the Dharma.
“He follows the ways of the dumb and the incoherent, yet, having acquired the power of incantations, he is adorned with a varied eloquence
“He follows the ways of the outsiders without ever becoming an outsider
“Thereupon, Māra said to the goddesses
‘Now come along and let us return home.
He follows the ways of all the world, yet he reverses all states of existence
“They said
‘You gave us to this householder
Now we should enjoy the delights of the Dharma and should no longer enjoy the pleasures of desires.
thereby following the way to the qualities of the Buddha.
“Then Māra said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
‘If it is so that the bodhisattva, the spiritual hero, has no mental attachment, and gives away all his possessions
then, householder, please give me these goddesses.
Practice it! What is it
Sisters, a single lamp may light hundreds of thousands of lamps without itself being diminished
Likewise, sisters, a single bodhisattv
Sisters, there is a door of the Dharma called “The Inexhaustible Lamp.
And they become their servants or slaves
Or serve as their disciples
“Here in the world, they fearlessly behold Those who are masters to be served
“Then the goddesses, saluting Vimalakīrti, said to him
“Well trained in liberative art, They demonstrate all activities, Whichever possibly may be a method To make beings delight in the Dharma
May you fulfill the religious aspirations of all living beings!
“They become great holy men, With the superknowledges and pure continence, And thus induce living beings to the morality Of tolerance, gentleness, and discipline
having no laziness in seeking the Dharma
taking pleasure in skillful dedication
never being satisfied with the roots of virtue already accumulated
giving up body and life in order to uphold the holy Dharma
not abandoning the means of unification
not tiring in the positive development of living beings
not forgetting the omniscient mind generated by high resolve
not giving up the great compassion
“Not to destroy compounded things consists in not losing the great love
But the bodhisattva should neither destroy the compounded nor rest in the uncompounded
Indestructible’ refers to the uncompounded
‘Destructible’ refers to compounded things
What is it
You must train yourselves in this liberation
“Noble sons, there is a liberation of bodhisattvas called destructible and indestructible
the Buddha declared
Thus having been requested
Lord, please give us a teaching by which we may remember you, when we have returned to Sarva­gandha­sugandhā.
they manifest such and such a field to suit the desire of such and such a living being
In order to develop living beings
“Lord, when we first arrived in this buddhafield, we conceived a negative idea, but we now abandon this wrong idea
saluting the Tathāgata Śākyamuni, addressed him as follows
Then, all those bodhisattvas from the buddhafield of the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa joined their palms in reverence and
being without selfish reticence in teaching the Dharma
sparing no effort in seeing and worshiping the tathāgatas
being fearless in voluntary reincarnations
being content with little desire in order to uphold the Dharma
seeking knowledge in order to avoid pride
blazing with energy to conquer the host of demons
and of the attainment of all the aids to enlightenment, consummated in the realization of the gnosis of omniscience as well as in accomplishment of all virtue
establishing the virtues of all buddhafields in one’s own buddhafield
of the store of all roots of virtue, consummated in the abandonment of all afflictions, obscurations, and unvirtuous things
never ceasing accumulation of the roots of virtue
considering the aids to enlightenment to be servants
considering the transcendences to be parents
considering immoral beings to be saviors
considering the giving away of all possessions to be the means of realizing buddhahood
considering beggars to be spiritual teachers
conceiving of the world as a garden of liberation
Here you are, without previously having come, been seen, or been heard
Mañjuśrī! You are very welcome
“Mañjuśrī! Welcome
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti saw the crown prince Mañjuśrī and addressed him thus
conceiving of trance, meditation, and equanimity as if they were the Avīci hell
not longing for one’s own happiness but longing for the happiness of others
And, except for the invalid’s couch upon which Vimalakīrti himself was lying, no bed or couch or seat could be seen anywhere
being neither proud in success nor bowed in failure
not despising the unlearned, and respecting the learned as if they were the Teacher himself
there is then no sacrifice of the great compassion for all living beings living in the bad migrations
He knows selflessnes, but does not waste himself
Although both pleasure and pain are abandoned when the buddha-qualities are fully accomplished
He considers misery, but he reincarnates voluntarily
He knows impermanence but is not complacent about his roots of virtue
He practices non-performance but does not realize non-performance
He practices wishlessness but does not realize wishlessness
He practices signlessness but does not realize signlessness
but he should not realize the cessation of sensation
The bodhisattva practices voidness, but he does not realize voidness
“What is not resting in the uncompounded
Noble sons, a bodhisattva who thus applies himself to the Dharma is a bodhisattva who does not destroy the compounded realm
and being consciously aware at all times not to neglect any good quality
Their consorts are the means of unification, Their music is the teaching of the Dharma
gathering together the order of bodhisattvas to attract beings to the Mahāyāna
With trees of the great wealth of the Dharma, And fruits of the gnosis of liberation
“Their pool consists of the eight liberations
being without attachment to anything and thus acquiring the behavior of a buddha
Filled with the water of concentration
disciplining body, speech, and mind, thus maintaining constant spiritual progress
Covered with the lotuses of the seven purities
Who bathes therein becomes immaculate
“Their bearers are the six superknowledges
Thereby they realize supreme enlightenment
Their friends are the aids to enlightenment
inviting the buddhas to teach the Dharma, rejoicing in them, and applauding them, thereby obtaining the melodious voice of a buddha
establishing the path of the pure states of Brahmā by cultivating the four immeasurables
tasting human and divine success by purifying the path of the ten virtues
having irresistible speech by acquiring unimpeded eloquence
displaying invincible miraculous feats to teach the Dharma
understanding the degrees of people’s spiritual faculties to dispel the doubts of all living beings
may establish many hundreds of thousands of living beings in enlightenment without his mindfulness being diminished
In fact, not only does it not diminish, it grows stronger
Likewise, the more you teach and demonstrate virtuous qualities to others, the more you grow with respect to these virtuous qualities
This is the door of the Dharma called “The Inexhaustible Lamp.
When you are living in the realm of Māra, inspire innumerable gods and goddesses with the spirit of enlightenment
He is not involved in the three worlds
is free of the three defilements
is associated with the triple liberation
is endowed with the three knowledges
and has truly attained the unattainable
He is neither the other shore
nor this shore
nor that between
nor is he a non-conception
He has no single nature nor any diversity of natures
He is not a conception, not a mental construction
nor has he any characteristic
He is not without any characteristic
He is not produced from causes, nor does he depend on conditions
there is no need to mention those who apply themselves to the yoga of meditation upon it
They will cut off all possibility of unhappy lives
will open their way to all fortunate lives
will always be looked after by all buddhas
will always overcome all adversaries
and will always conquer all devils
They will practice the path of the bodhisattvas
will take their places upon the seat of enlightenment
and will have truly entered the domain of the tathāgatas
His retinue of disciples numbered thirty-six million billion
and his retinue of bodhisattvas numbered twelve million billion
Lord, the noble sons and daughters who will teach and practice this exposition of the Dharma will be honored and served by me and my followers
In that same era, king of gods, there was a universal monarch called King Ratnacchattra, who reigned over the four continents and possessed seven precious jewels
He had one thousand heroic sons, powerful, strong, and able to conquer enemy armies
I will inspire the unbelieving with faith, and I will guarantee my help and protection to those who believe and uphold the Dharma.
At these words
the Buddha said to Śakra, the king of the gods
“Excellent! Excellent
king of gods! The Tathāgata rejoices in your good words
In such a way, you will repay the kindness of the Tathāgata
King of gods, the enlightenment of the buddhas of the past, present, and future is expressed in this discourse of Dharma
and you will become the benefactors of all living beings
’“Then, those goddesses bowed at the feet of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and departed in the company of Māra
Thus, Lord, I saw the supremacy of the magical power, wisdom, and eloquence of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
and therefore I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.
The Buddha then said to the merchant’s son, Sudatta
“The length of life of this perfectly and fully enlightened Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja was twenty short eons
“‌Noble son, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
Sudatta replied
“Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
and, taking his robes and ornaments, he offered them to the Buddha Bhaiṣajyarāja, saying
“King of gods, when the prince Candracchattra had heard this definition of Dharma-worship from the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, he attained the conformative tolerance of ultimate birthlessness
What is the use of the sacrifice of material things?’
On the seventh and final day of this great sacrifice, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said
The gods replied
Why? Lord, I remember one da
‘What is this “Dharma-worship”?’
‘Good man, the supreme worship is Dharma-worship.’
I then asked him
‘Merchant’s son, you should not celebrate a sacrifice in this way. You should celebrate a Dharma-sacrifice
“He replied
‘A Dharma-sacrifice is that which develops living beings without beginning or end, giving gifts to them all simultaneously
of the great compassion consummated in the concentration of the holy Dharma on the liberation of all living beings
of the great joy consummated in the awareness of the supreme happiness of all living beings
and of the great equanimity consummated in concentration through knowledge
They are praised by all the buddhas
They cause the abandonment of avarice, immorality, malice, laziness, forgetfulness, foolishness, and jealousy, as well as bad convictions, adherence to objects, and all opposition
and self-discipline; of the transcendence of morality, which is consummated in the moral development of immoral beings
of the transcendence of effort, consummated in initiative toward enlightenment
of the transcendence of tolerance, consummated through the principle of selflessness
of the transcendence of meditation, consummated in the solitude of body and mind
and of the transcendence of wisdom, consummated in the omniscient gnosis
realizing correctly the reality of the Buddha
of the meditation of signlessness, consummated in the purification of all compounded things
and of the meditation of wishlessness, consummated in voluntarily assuming rebirths
of the power of life, consummated in the means of unification
relying on reality and not insisting on opinions derived from personal authoritie
of the absence of pride, consummated in becoming the slave and the disciple of all living beings
relying on the ultimate teachings definitive in meaning and not insisting on the superficial teachings interpretable in meaning
of the gain of body, health, and wealth, consummated by the extraction of essence from the essenceless
relying on gnosis and not on consciousness
relying on the meaning and not on the literal expression
being free of egoism
not being possessive
without quarreling or disputing
refraining from struggle about causes and conditions
They are approved and praised by the chiefs of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
“ ‘They make possible the attainment of the seat of enlightenment and set in motion the wheel of the Dharma
“ ‘Furthermore, noble son, the Dharma-worship consists of determining the Dharma according to the Dharma
They eliminate all the convictions of the māras, and they manifest relativity
They had attained the intuitive tolerance of the ultimate incomprehensibility and unborn nature of all things
They turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma
They were stamped with the insignia of signlessness
They were expert in knowing the spiritual faculties of all living beings
They were brave with the confidence that overawes all assemblies
They had gathered the great stores of merit and of wisdom
were adorned with all the auspicious signs and marks
and their bodies, beautiful without ornaments
They were exalted in fame and glory, like the lofty summit of Mount Sumeru
Their high resolve as hard as diamond, unbreakable in their faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha
thus incorporating into one’s own life the holy Dharma—that is “Dharma-worship.
They introduce living beings to the great compassion and teach them the great love
They had penetrated the profound principle of relativity an
had destroyed the persistence of the instinctual mental habits underlying all convictions concerning finitude and infinitude
“Noble sons, the universe Sahā exists beyond as many buddhafields in the direction of the nadir as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers
Then the venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha
When those who have entered destiny for the ultimate eat this food, it will not be digested until their minds are totally liberated
They were expert in the way of the Dharma, which is straight, peaceful, subtle, gentle, hard to see, and difficult to realize
They were endowed with the wisdom that is able to understand the thoughts of living beings, as well as their comings and goings
They spoke fearlessly, like lions
sounding the thunder of the magnificent teaching
Unequaled, they surpassed all measure
They were the best captains for the voyage of discovery of the treasures of the Dharma, the stores of merit and wisdom
They had been consecrated with the anointment of the peerless gnosis of the Buddha
Four of them, Krakucchanda and the others, have already appeare
They are endowed with all the aids to enlightenment and embody the seven factors of enlightenment
“Ānanda, were your life to last an entire eon, it would not be easy for you to understand thoroughly the extensive meaning and precise verbal significance of these three names
and the rest are still to be born
As sūtras, they are collected in the canon of the bodhisattvas, stamped with the insignia of the king of incantations and teachings
They do not conform to the mundane and are difficult to understand and difficult to see and difficult to realize
They start from Krakucchanda and end with the Tathāgata Roca, who will be the last to be born
‘Noble son, Dharma-worship is that worship rendered to the discourses taught by the Tathāgata. These discourses are deep and profound in illumination
Thus, it is necessary to know, king of gods, that among all the worships rendered to the Tathāgata, Dharma-worship is the very best
Yes, it is good, eminent, excellent, perfect, supreme, and unexcelled
And therefore, king of gods, do not worship me with material objects but worship me with Dharma-worship
Do not honor me with material objects but honor me by honor to the Dharma!
Then the Lord Śākyamuni said to the bodhisattva Maitreya, the great spiritual hero
“I transmit to you, Maitreya, this unexcelled, perfect enlightenment which I attained only after innumerable millions of billions of eons
in order that, at a later time, during a later life, a similar teaching of the Dharma, protected by your supernatural power, will spread in the world and will not disappear
Indeed, it is wonderful how all the lord buddhas, who understand the equality of all things, manifest all sorts of buddhafields in order to develop living beings
“Ānanda, just as the buddhafields are diverse as to their specific qualities but have no difference as to the sky that covers them
Thus it is taught, king of gods, and thus you must understand it.
and one honors them by Dharma worship, and not by material worship
They induce the unmistaken understanding of the Dharma in its ultimate sense
Because, king of gods, the enlightenment of the buddhas arises from the Dharma
Why so
so, Ānanda, the tathāgatas are diverse as to their physical bodies but do not differ as to their unimpeded gnosis
The Buddha said
bowed down at his feet, circumambulated him to the right three times, and withdrew to one side
’“Then, the prince Candracchattra went to the Lord Bhaiṣajyarāja, the arhat, the Tathāgata, the unexcelled, perfectly enlightened one, and, having approached him
and he will explain it to you fully
And let us suppose finally that, having erected all these stūpas for the tathāgatas, he or she were to devote an eon or more to offering them flowers, perfumes, banners, and standards, while playing drums and music
rising as high as the world of Brahmā, adorned with parasols, banners, standards, and lamps
‘When the Tathāgata will be in ultimate liberation, I wish to defend his holy Dharma, to protect it, and to worship it
May the Tathāgata grant me his supernatural blessing, that I may be able to conquer Māra and all adversaries and to incorporate in all my lives the holy Dharma of the Buddha!’
As for the thousand sons of the King Ratnacchattra, they are now the thousand bodhisattvas of the present blessed eon
The Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, knowing the high resolve of Candracchattra, prophesied to him that he would be, at a later time, in the future, the protector, guardian, and defender of the city of the holy Dharma
and innumerable living beings took rebirth in the human and heavenly realms
They were totally dedicated through the transcendences of generosity; subdued, unwavering, and sincere morality; tolerance; effort; meditation; wisdom; skill in liberative art; commitment; power; and gnosis
they showered forth the rain of ambrosia that is released by the light rays of the jewel of the Dharma, which shines everywhere
Their voices were perfect in diction and resonance, and versatile in speaking all languages
With their high resolve, they approached the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen special qualities of the Buddha
They had crossed the terrifying abyss of the bad migrations, and yet they assumed reincarnation voluntarily in all migrations for the sake of disciplining living beings
understanding all the sicknesses of passions
These bodhisattvas were named: Samadarśin, Sama­viṣama­darśin, Samādhi­vikurvaṇa­rāja, Dharmeśvara, Dharmaketu, Prabhāketu, Prabhāvyūha, Ratnavyūha, Mahāvyūha, Pratibhāna­kūṭa, Ratnakūṭa, Ratnapāṇi, Ratna­mudrā­hasta, Nityotkṣipta­hasta, Nityotpalakṛta­hasta, Nityotkaṇṭhita, Nitya­prahasita­pramuditendriya, Prāmodyarāja, Devarāja, Praṇidhi­prayāta­prāpta, Prati­saṃvit­praṇāda­prāpta, Gaganagañja, Ratnolkā­dhārin, Ratnavīra, Ratnananda, Ratnaśrī, Indrajāla, Jālinīprabha, Anārambaṇa­dhyāyin, Prajñākūta, Ratnajaha, Mārapramardin, Vidyuddeva, Vikurvaṇarāja, Lakṣaṇa­kūṭa­samatikrānta, Siṃha­ghoṣābhigarjita­śvara, Śaila­śikhara­saṃghaṭṭana­rāja, Gandhahastin, Gaja­gandha­hastin, Satatodyukta, Anikṣiptadhura, Sumati, Sujāta, Padmaśrī­garbha, Padmavyūha, Avalokiteśvara, Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, Brahmajāla, Ratnayaṣṭin, Mārajit, Kṣetralaṃkṛta, Maṇi­ratnacchattra, Suvarnacūḍa, Maṇicūḍa, Maitreya, Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, and so forth, with the remainder of the thirty-two thousand
There were also gathered there ten thousand Brahmās, at their head Brahmā Śikhin, who had come from the Aśoka universe with its four sectors to see, venerate, and serve the Buddha and to hear the Dharma from his own mouth
There were twelve thousand Śakras from various four-sector universes
Thereupon, the Licchavi bodhisattva Ratnākara, with five hundred Licchavi youths, each holding a precious parasol made of seven different kinds of jewels, came forth from the city of Vaiśālī and presented himself at the grove of Āmrapālī
Each approached the Buddha, bowed at his feet
circumambulated him clockwise seven times
laid down his precious parasol in offering, and withdrew to one side
As soon as all these precious parasols had been laid down, suddenly, by the miraculous power of the Lord, they were transformed into a single precious canop
the king of mountains, Mount Sumeru; Mount Himavat, Mount Mucilinda, Mount Mahāmucilinda, Mount Gandhamādana, Mount Ratnaparvata, Mount Kālaparvata, Mount Cakravāḍa, and Mount Mahācakravāḍa
all the great oceans, rivers, bays, torrents, streams, brooks, and springs; an
limitless mansions of suns, moons, and stellar bodies; the realms of the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, as well as the realms of the four Mahārājas
raised his hands, palms pressed together in salute of the Buddha
and praised him with the following hymn
Immeasurable is the ocean of your virtues, the accumulation of your good deeds
You affirm the path of peace. O Great Ascetic, obeisance to you
Leader, bull of men, we behold the revelation of your miracle
Dharma-King, you rule with the Dharma your supreme Dharma-kingdom, And thereby bestow the treasures of the Dharma upon all living beings
Therein is neither ego, nor experiencer, nor doer, Yet no action, good or evil, loses its effects. Such is your teaching
O Śākyamuni, conquering the powerful host of Māra
You found peace, immortality, and the happiness of that supreme enlightenmen
That is not realized by any among the outsiders
Though they arrest their feeling, thought, and mental processes
O Wonderful King of Dharma, you turned the wheel of Dharma before men and gods, With its threefold revolution, its manifold aspects, Its extreme peace, and its purity of nature
We bow to you who are dauntless, knowing no fear
We bow to you, leader of all living beings, Who fully manifests the special qualities
We bow to you who have cut the bondage of all fetters
We bow to you who, having gone beyond, stand on firm ground
Upon this request, the Buddha gave his approval to the young Licchavi Ratnākara. “Good, good, young man
Your question to the Tathāgata about the purification of the buddhafield is indeed good
Very good, Lord
A bodhisattva embraces a buddhafield to the same extent that he causes the development of living beings
Noble son, a buddhafield of bodhisattvas springs from the aims of living beings
In just the same way, should a bodhisattva, who knows full well that all things are like empty space, wish to build a buddhafield in order to develop living beings
he might go ahead, in spite of the fact that it is not possible to build or to adorn a buddhafield in empty space
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who live by love, compassion, joy, and impartiality will be born in his buddhafield
Living beings who devote their efforts to the four foci of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of magical power, the five spiritual faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the eight branches of the holy path will be born in his buddhafield
When he attains enlightenment, living beings who are secure in long life, great in wealth, chaste in conduct, enhanced by true speech, soft-spoken, free of divisive intrigues and adroit in reconciling factions, enlightening in their conversations, free of envy, free of malice, and endowed with perfect views will be born in his buddhafield
The purity of his buddhafield reflects the purity of living beings
the purity of the living beings reflects the purity of his gnosis
the purity of his gnosis reflects the purity of his doctrine
the purity of his doctrine reflects the purity of his transcendental practice
and the purity of his transcendental practice reflects the purity of his own mind
and suddenly it was transformed into a huge mass of precious jewels
I see it, Lord! Here before me is a display of splendor such as I never before heard of or beheld
He maintained tolerance and self-control in order to reconcile beings who were angry, cruel, violent, and brutal
He lived at home, but remained aloof from the realm of desire, the realm of pure matter, and the immaterial realm
He had a son, a wife, and female attendants, yet always maintained continence
He appeared to be surrounded by servants, yet lived in solitude
At that time, out of this very skill in liberative art, Vimalakīrti manifested himself as if sick
To inquire after his health, the king, the officials, the lords, the youths, the brahmins, the householders, the businessmen, the townfolk, the countryfolk, and thousands of other living beings came forth from the great city of Vaiśālī and called on the invalid
This body is inert, like the earth; selfless, like water; lifeless, like fire; impersonal, like the wind; and nonsubstantial, like space
Therefore, you should be repelled by such a body. You should despair of it and should arouse your admiration for the body of the Tathāgata
It is born of the concentrations, the liberations, the meditations, and the absorptions
It is born of learning, wisdom, and liberative art
It is born of the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen special qualities
It is born of the abandonment of all evil qualities, and of the gathering of all good qualities
It is born of reality. It is born of conscious awareness
Friends, the body of a tathāgata is born of innumerable good works
Toward such a body you should turn your aspirations
The body of a tathāgata is born of the stores of merit and wisdom. It is born of morality, of concentration, of wisdom, of the liberations, and of the knowledge and vision of liberation
and, in order to eliminate the sicknesses of the passions of all living beings, you should conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
While the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thus taught the Dharma to those who had come to inquire about his sickness
many hundreds of thousands of living beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought to himself
‘Reverend Śāriputra, those who absorb themselves in contemplation in such a way are declared by the Lord to be truly absorbed in contemplation.
Maudgalyāyana replied
Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness
I remember one day when I was teaching the Dharma to the householders in a square in the great city of Vaiśālī, an
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came along and said to me
The Dharma must be taught according to reality
Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness
then you yourself may eat. Thus, when you eat, after offering, you should be neither affected by afflictions nor free of afflictions
neither involved in concentration nor free of concentration
neither living in the world nor abiding in liberation
Furthermore, those who give such alms, reverend, have neither great merit nor small merit
Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was astonishe
Reverend Subhūti, take this food if you understand the sameness of all things through the sameness of material objects, and if you understand the sameness of the qualities of the Buddha through the sameness of all things
if, without abandoning desire, hatred, and folly, you can avoid association with them
if, without seeing the Buddha, hearing the Dharma, or serving the Saṅgha, you undertake the religious life under the six outsider master
namely, Purāṇa Kāśyapa, Māskārin Gośāli­putra, Saṃjāyin Vairaṭi­putra, Kakuda Kātyāyana, Ajita Keśakambala, and Nirgrantha Jñāti­putra, and follow the ways they prescribe
if you do not rely on the saṅgha; and finally, if you never enter ultimate liberation
When Vimalakīrti had discoursed in this way, two hundred gods obtained the pure doctrinal vision in regard to all things, without obscurity or defilement
and five hundred gods obtained the conformative tolerance
So do not instruct them in the disciple vehicle
As soon as their own spirits of enlightenment had become clear to them, they bowed at the feet of that good man an
pressed their palms together in reverence
It occurred to me then
These disciples are not expert in discerning the superiority and inferiority of the spiritual faculties of living beings
Kātyāyana replied
Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
Lord, I remember one day when
I was defining the expressions of that discourse by teaching the meaning of impermanence, suffering, selflessness, and peace
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me
do not teach an ultimate reality endowed with activity, production, and destruction
nothing was ever destroyed, is destroyed, or will ever be destroyed
Such is the meaning of “impermanence.
and what does not burn is not extinguished; such lack of extinction is the meaning of “peace.
“Aniruddha, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness.
when I was taking a walk, the great Brahmā named Śubhavyūha and the ten thousand other Brahmās who accompanied him illuminated the place with their radiance and
To what distance does the divine vision of the venerable Aniruddha extend
I answered
just as plainly as a man of ordinary vision sees a myrobalan nut on the palm of his hand
When I had said these words, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and
having bowed his head at my feet, said to me
If it is uncompounded in nature, then it is not constructed and
as such, is incapable of seeing. Then, how do you see, O elder?’“At these words, I became speechless
‘Who then, in the world, possesses the divine eye?
Upāli, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness
Upāli replied
there were two monks who had committed some infraction and were too ashamed to appear before the Lord
so they came to me and said
Reverend Upāli, we have both committed an infraction but are too ashamed to appear before the Buddha
Lord, while I was giving those two monks some religious discourse
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me
Why? The Buddha has said
Reverend Upāli, the mind is neither within nor without
With the exception of the Tathāgata himself, there is no disciple or bodhisattva capable of competing with his eloquenc
Therefore, I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
many young Licchavi gentlemen came to the place where I was and said to me
Renunciation is itself the very absence of virtues and benefits
It favors mental quiescenc
It is irreproachable in all respects an
so is called renunciation
the body of the Lord manifested some indisposition an
he required some milk
‘The body of the Lord manifests some indisposition, and he needs some milk. Therefore, I have come to fetch some.
Reverend Ānanda, do not bring shame upon us, but go in silence
lest the outsider sectarians should hear your words
For shame! The teacher of these people cannot even cure his own sicknesses. How then can he cure the sicknesses of others
In the same way, the rest of the five hundred disciples were reluctan
and each told the Buddha his own adventure, recounting all his conversations with the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
one day I was engaged in a conversation with the gods of the Tuṣita heaven, the god Saṃtuṣita and his retinue, about the stage of nonregression of the great bodhisattvas. At that time
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and addressed me as follows
Is it past? Is it future? Or is it present
If it is a past birth, it is already finished
If it is a future birth, it will never arrive
If it is a present birth, it does not abide
For the Buddha has declared
Therefore, Maitreya, is your reality from birth? Or is it from cessation
Furthermore, your reality is just the same as the reality of all living beings, the reality of all things, and the reality of all the holy ones
Because reality does not consist of duality or of diversity
Enlightenment consists of the realizations of all living beings
The tathāgatas do not enter ultimate liberation until all living beings have entered ultimate liberation
Enlightenment is the complete knowledge of the thoughts, deeds, and inclinations of all living beings
The body is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and optical illusions
the roots of virtue, the ability to develop living beings, and the incorporation of the holy Dharma, whether they lift up their feet or put them down
they all come from the seat of enlightenment
the wicked Māra, disguised as Indra and surrounded with twelve thousand heavenly maidens
approached me with the sounds of music and singing
It is the joy of unbreakable faith in the Buddha, of wishing to hear the Dharma, of serving the Saṅgha and honoring the spiritual benefactors without pride
It is the joy of renunciation of the whole world, of not being fixed in objects, of considering the five aggregates to be like murderers, of considering the elements to be like venomous serpents, and of considering the sense-media to be like an empty town
It is the joy of always guarding the spirit of enlightenment, of helping living beings, of sharing through generosity, of not slackening in morality, of control and tolerance in patience, of thorough cultivation of virtue by effort, of total absorption in meditation, and of absence of afflictions in wisdom
It is the joy of extending enlightenment, of conquering the māras, of destroying the afflictions, and of purifying the buddhafield
It is the joy of exploration of the three doors of liberation, and of the realization of liberation
It is the joy of being an ornament of the seat of enlightenment, and of not attaining liberation at the wrong time
It is the joy of serving those of equal fortune, of not hating or resenting those of superior fortune, of serving the spiritual benefactors, and of avoiding sinful friends
It is the joy of acquiring liberative arts and of the conscious cultivation of the aids to enlightenment
Vimalakīrti replied
They are given, Māra. Go home with your retinue
Householder, how should we live in the abode of the māras
in my father’s house when, in order to celebrate a great sacrifice
I was bestowing gifts upon religious devotees, brahmins, the poor, the wretched, the unfortunate, beggars, and all the needy
the transcendence of generosity, which is consummated in peacefulnes
the meditation of voidness, consummated in effectiveness in the development of all living beings
heroic strength, consummated in the upholding of the holy Dharma
the store of merit which is consummated by the auspicious signs and marks, the ornaments of the buddhafields, and all other means of development of living beings
of the store of knowledge which is consummated in the ability to teach the Dharma according to the thoughts and actions of all living beings
of the store of wisdom, which is consummated in the uniform gnosis free of acceptance and rejection in regard to all things
That, noble son, is the Dharma-sacrifice. The bodhisattva who lives by this Dharma-sacrifice is the best of sacrificers, and, through his extreme sacrifice, is himself worthy of offerings from all people, including the gods
But he would not accept it. I then said to him
And he performed a miracle such that all present beheld the universe called Marīci and the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha
On the head of the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha, the pearl necklace took the form of a pavilion, decorated with strings of pearls, resting on four bases, with four columns, symmetrical, well constructed, and lovely to behold
Having shown such a miracle, Vimalakīrti said
In the same way, all the bodhisattvas, the great spiritual heroes, told the stories of their conversations with Vimalakīrti and declared their reluctance to go to him
Then, the Buddha said to the crown prince, Mañjuśrī
Mañjuśrī, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness
He is extremely skilled in full expressions and in the reconciliation of dichotomies
His eloquence is inexorable, and no one can resist his imperturbable intellect
Coming is not really known in coming, and going is not really known in going
Mañjuśrī, for the bodhisattva, the world consists only of living beings, and sickness is inherent in living in the world
And the parents will suffer as long as that only son does not recover from his sickness
Just so, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva loves all living beings as if each were his only child
Householder, why is your house empty? Why have you no servants
Mañjuśrī, all buddhafields are also empty
They are empty because of emptiness
What makes them empty
What is “empty” about emptiness
Constructions are empty, because of emptiness
Can emptiness be conceptually constructed
Even that concept is itself empty, and emptiness cannot construct emptiness
Householder, where should emptiness be sought
Mañjuśrī, emptiness should be sought among the sixty-two convictions
Where should the sixty-two convictions be sought
They should be sought in the liberation of the tathāgatas
Where should the liberation of the tathāgatas be sought
It should be sought in the prime mental activity of all living beings
The māras advocate this life of birth and death and the bodhisattva does not avoid life
Householder, of what sort is your sickness
It is immaterial and invisible
Is it physical or mental
It is not physical, since the body is insubstantial in itself. It is not mental, since the nature of the mind is like illusion
Householder, which of the four main elements is disturbed: earth, water, fire, or air
Mañjuśrī, I am sick only because the elements of living beings are disturbed by sicknesses
how should a bodhisattva console another bodhisattva who is sick
the body is impermanent, but should not exhort him to renunciation or disgust
the body is miserable, but should not encourage him to find solace in liberation
to confess his evil deeds, but not just to escape them
to manifest the roots of virtue, to maintain the primal purity and the lack of craving, and thus to always strive to become the king of healers, who can cure all sicknesses
Noble sir, how should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind
Mañjuśrī, a sick bodhisattva should control his own mind with the following consideration
The body is the issue of the four main elements, and in these elements there is no owner and no agent
he should abandon the conception of himself as a personality and produce the conception of himself as a thing, thinking
When they are born, they do not think, “I am born”
when they cease, they do not think, “I cease.
It is the elimination of egoism and possessiveness
It is the freedom from dualism
It is the absence of involvement with either the external or the internal
It is non-deviation, non-fluctuation, and non-distraction from sameness
Because both self and liberation are void
Therefore, one who sees such sameness makes no difference between sickness and voidness; his sickness is itself voidness, and that sickness as voidness is itself void
should recognize that sensation is ultimately nonsensation
To the extent that a basis of object-perception is objectified, it is the basis of sickness
It is its nonperception, as one does not objectify a thing that is not perceived
One does not perceive the two views, the view of the self and the view of the other
Mañjuśrī, thus should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind in order to overcome old age, sickness, death, and birth
Such, Mañjuśrī, is the sickness of the bodhisattva
Just as my sickness is unreal and nonexistent, so the sicknesses of all living beings are unreal and nonexistent
Because great compassion that falls into sentimentally purposive views only exhausts the bodhisattva in his reincarnations
And what is liberation
To indulge in liberation from the world without employing liberative art is bondage for the bodhisattva. To engage in life in the world with full employment of liberative art is liberation for the bodhisattva
Wisdom not integrated with liberative art consists of concentration on voidness, signlessness, and wishlessness, and yet it fails to concentrate on cultivation of the auspicious signs and marks, on the adornment of the buddhafield, and on the work of development of living beings—and it is bondage
Wisdom integrated with liberative art consists of concentration on cultivation of the auspicious signs and marks, on the adornment of the buddhafield, and on the work of development of living beings, all the while concentrating on deep investigation of voidness, signlessness, and wishlessness—and it is liberation
The bondage of liberative art not integrated with wisdom consists of the bodhisattva’s planting of the roots of virtue without dedicating them for the sake of enlightenment, while living in the grip of dogmatic convictions, passions, attachments, resentments, and their subconscious instincts
His liberative art consists of not exhausting himself by trying to avoid all physical sickness, and of applying himself to accomplish the benefit of living beings, without interrupting the cycle of reincarnations
To live by indulging the mind is proper for fools and to live in control of the mind is proper for the disciples
Therefore, the bodhisattva should live neither in control nor in indulgence of his mind
Not living in either of the two extremes is the domain of the bodhisattva
A domain where one realizes that all the buddhafields are indestructible and uncreatable, having the nature of infinite space, yet where one manifests the establishment of the qualities of the buddhafields in all their variety and magnitude, such is the domain of the bodhisattva
When Vimalakīrti had spoken this discourse, eight thousand of the gods in the company of the crown prince Mañjuśrī conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
Thereupon, the venerable Śāriputra had this thought
There is not even a single chair in this house
Where are these disciples and bodhisattvas going to sit
I came for the sake of the Dharma, not for the sake of a chair
Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma is not interested even in his own body, much less in a chair
The Dharma is ultimately without formulation and without verbalization
Who verbalizes: ‘Suffering should be recognized, origination should be eliminated, cessation should be realized, the path should be practiced,
is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in verbalization
Mañjuśrī, you have already been in innumerable hundreds of thousands of buddhafields throughout the universes of the ten directions
In which buddhafield did you see the best lion-thrones with the finest qualities
Noble sir, if one crosses the buddhafields to the east, which are more numerous than all the grains of sand of thirty-two Ganges rivers, one will discover a universe called Merudhvaja
There dwells a tathāgata called Meru­pradīpa­rāja
His body measures eighty-four hundred thousand leagues in height, and the height of his throne is sixty-eight hundred thousand leagues
At that moment, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having focused himself in concentration
performed a miraculous feat such that the Lord Tathāgata Meru­pradīpa­rāja, in the universe Merudhvaja, sent to this universe thirty-two hundred thousand thrones
These thrones were so tall, spacious, and beautiful that the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, and other gods had never before seen the like
The thrones descended from the sky and came to rest in the house of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
Everything else appeared just as it was before
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince Mañjuśrī
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the venerable Śāriputra
Reverend Śāriputra, take your seat upon a throne
Good sir, the thrones are too big and too high, and I cannot sit upon them
Reverend Śāriputra, bow down to the Tathāgata Meru­pradīpa­rāja, and you will be able to take your seat
Noble sir, it is astonishing that these thousands of thrones, so big and so high, should fit into such a small house an
Noble sir, it is astonishing that these thousands of thrones, so big and so high, should fit into such a small house an
Such a bodhisattva can pick up with his right hand this billion-world galactic universe as if it were a potter’s wheel and, spinning it round, throw it beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges
without the living beings therein knowing their motion or its origin
and he can catch it and put it back in its place, without the living beings suspecting their coming and going; and yet the whole operation is visible
Likewise, he can place all living beings in the palm of his right hand an
can show them with the supernatural speed of thought all the buddhafields without ever leaving his own buddhafield
The bodhisattva can transform miraculously all the cries and noises—superior, mediocre, and inferior, of all living beings of the ten directions, into the voice of the Buddha, with the words of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha
having them proclaim, ‘Impermanent! Miserable! Empty! Selfless!
Then, the patriarch Mahākāśyapa, having heard this teaching of the inconceivable liberation of the bodhisattvas, was amazed
and he said to the venerable Śāriputra
Venerable Śāriputra, if one were to show a variety of things to a person blind from birth, he would not be able to see a single thing
Reverend Mahākāśyapa, just as a glowworm cannot eclipse the light of the sun
so, reverend Mahākāśyapa, it is not possible without special allowance that an ordinary person can thus attack and deprive a bodhisattva
just as a donkey could not muster an attack on a wild elephant
even so, reverend Mahākāśyapa, one who is not himself a bodhisattva cannot harass a bodhisattva
Only one who is himself a bodhisattva can harass another bodhisattva, an
only a bodhisattva can tolerate the harassment of another bodhisattva
Reverend Mahākāśyapa, such is the introduction to the power of the knowledge of liberative art of the bodhisattvas who live in the inconceivable liberation
Thereupon, Mañjuśrī, the crown prince, addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
a bodhisattva should regard all living beings as a wise man regards the reflection of the moon in water or as magicians regard men created by magic
as being like a face in a mirror
like the water of a mirage
like the sound of an echo
like a mass of clouds in the sky
like the previous moment of a ball of foam
like the appearance and disappearance of a bubble of water
like the core of a plantain tree
like a flash of lightning
like the fifth great element
like the seventh sense-medium
like the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm
like a sprout from a rotten seed
like a tortoise-hair coat
like the fun of games for one who wishes to die
like the egoistic views of a stream-winner
like a third rebirth of a once-returner
like the descent of a nonreturner into a womb
like the existence of desire, hatred, and folly in an arhat
like thoughts of avarice, immorality, wickedness, and hostility in a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance
like the instincts of afflictions in a tathāgata
like the perception of color in one blind from birth
like the inhalation and exhalation of an ascetic absorbed in the meditation of cessation
like the track of a bird in the sky
like the erection of a eunuch
like the pregnancy of a barren woman
like the unproduced afflictions of an emanated incarnation of the Tathāgata
like dream-visions seen after waking
like the afflictions of one who is free of conceptualizations
like fire burning without fuel
like the reincarnation of one who has attained ultimate liberation
Noble sir, if a bodhisattva considers all living beings in such a way, how does he generate the great love toward them
Mañjuśrī, when a bodhisattva considers all living beings in this way
he thinks: ‘Just as I have realized the Dharma, so should I teach it to living beings.
Thereby, he generates the love that is truly a refuge for all living beings
the love that is peaceful because free of grasping
the love that is not feverish, because free of passions
Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its high resolve unbreakable, like a diamond
the love that is pure, purified in its intrinsic nature
the love that is even, its aspirations being equal
the love that is enlightenment because it is unity of experience
the love that has no presumption because it has eliminated attachment and aversion
What is the great compassion of a bodhisattva
It is the giving of all accumulated roots of virtue to all living beings
What is the great joy of a bodhisattva
It is to be joyful and without regret in giving
What is the equanimity of a bodhisattva
It is what benefits both self and others
To what should one resort when terrified by fear of life
Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha
Where should he who wishes to resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha take his stand
Where should he who wishes to stand in equanimity toward all living beings take his stand
He should live for the liberation of all living beings
What should he who wishes to liberate all living beings do
How should he who wishes to eliminate afflictions apply himself
Mañjuśrī, when something is baseless, how can it have any root
What is the root of baselessness
Baselessness
What is the root of the false concept
He should stand in equanimity toward all living beings
He should liberate them from their afflictions
He should apply himself appropriately
How should he apply himself, to “apply himself appropriately”
He should apply himself to productionlessness and to destructionlessness
What is not produced? And what is not destroyed
Evil is not produced and good is not destroyed
What is the root of good and evil
Materiality is the root of good and evil
What is the root of materiality
Desire is the root of materiality
What is the root of desire and attachment
Unreal construction is the root of desire
What is the root of unreal construction
The false concept is its root
Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious persons and so we are trying to shake them off
These flowers are proper indeed
Such flowers have neither constructual thought nor discrimination
But the elder Śāriputra has both constructual thought and discrimination
Reverend Śāriputra, see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas! This is because they have eliminated constructual thoughts and discriminations
In the same way that evil spirits have power over fearful me
those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructive world
I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation
Then, have you been in this house for quite some time
Has the elder been in liberation for quite some time
Elder, you are ‘foremost of the wise!’ Why do you not speak
Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say
All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of liberation
Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can it be apprehended apart from them
The holy liberation is the equality of all things
Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred, and folly
“Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly”—that is the teaching for the excessively proud
Excellent! Excellent, goddess! Pray, what have you attained, what have you realized, that you have such eloquence
I have attained nothing, reverend Śāriputra
Goddess, do you belong to the disciple vehicle, to the solitary sage vehicle, or to the great vehicle
I belong to the disciple vehicle when I teach it to those who need it
And, since I never abandon the great compassion, I belong to the great vehicle
Nevertheless, reverend Śāriputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a magnolia wood, but only the magnolia flowers
so, reverend Śāriputra, living in this house, which is redolent with the perfume of the virtues of the buddha qualities, one does not smell the perfume of the disciples and the solitary sages
Reverend Śāriputra, the Śakras, the Brahmās, the Lokapālas, the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas who live in this hous
hear the Dharma from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by the perfume of the virtues of the buddha qualities, proceed to conceive the spirit of enlightenment
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, this house is never empty of the sounds of the Dharma, the discourse on the six transcendences, and the discourses of the irreversible wheel of the Dharma
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, in this house one always hears the rhythms, songs, and music of gods and men, and from this music constantly resounds the sound of the infinite Dharma of the Buddha
Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, in this house there are always four inexhaustible treasures, replete with all kinds of jewels
which never decrease, although all the poor and wretched may partake of them to their satisfaction
Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state
Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years, I have not yet found it
No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform
Just so, reverend Śāriputra, all things do not really exist
Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Śāriputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form
Then the goddess, transformed into Śāriputra, said to Śāriputra, transformed into a goddess
Reverend Śāriputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state
If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states
I neither made it nor did I change it
Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they are not made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha
Goddess, where will you be born when you transmigrate after death
I will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathāgata are born
But the emanated incarnations of the Tathāgata do not transmigrate nor are they born
All things and living beings are just the same; they do not transmigrate nor are they born
Goddess, how soon will you attain the perfect enlightenment of buddhahood
At such time as you, elder, become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual, then will I attain the perfect enlightenment of buddhahood
Goddess, it is impossible that I should become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual
Just so, reverend Śāriputra, it is impossible that I should attain the perfect enlightenment of buddhahood
Because perfect enlightenment stands upon the impossible. Because it is impossible, no one attains the perfect enlightenment of buddhahood
But the Tathāgata has declared
The tathāgatas, who are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, have attained perfect buddhahood
Reverend Śāriputra, the expression “the buddhas of the past, present, and future” is a conventional expression made up of a certain number of syllables
It is attained, because there is no attainment
Just so, there is perfect enlightenment because there is no attainment of perfect enlightenment
She has actually attained irreversibility
She can live wherever she wishes on the strength of her vow to develop living beings
Then, the crown prince Mañjuśrī asked the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
Mañjuśrī, when the bodhisattva follows the wrong way, he follows the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha
How does the bodhisattva follow the wrong way
Even should he enact the five deadly sins, he feels no malice, violence, or hate
Even should he go into the hells, he remains free of all taint of afflictions
He follows the way of liberation without ever abandoning the progress of the world
Mañjuśrī, thus does the bodhisattva follow the wrong ways
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti asked the crown prince Mañjuśrī
Mañjuśrī, what is the ‘family of the tathāgatas’
Noble sir, the family of the tathāgatas consists of all basic egoism; of ignorance and the thirst for existence; of lust, hate, and folly; of the four misapprehensions; of the five obscurations; of the six sense-media; of the seven abodes of consciousness; of the eight perverse paths; of the nine causes of irritation; and of the paths of the ten sins. Such is the family of the tathāgatas
Mañjuśrī, with what in mind do you say so
Noble sir, one who stays in the fixed determination of the vision of the uncreated is not capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment
Noble sir, flowers like the blue lotus, the red lotus, the white lotus, the water lily, and the moon lily do not grow on the dry ground in the wilderness
but do grow in the swamps and mud banks
Only those guilty of the five deadly sins can conceive the spirit of enlightenment and can attain buddhahood, which is the full accomplishment of the qualities of the Buddha
Ordinary individuals, upon learning of the virtues of the Buddha, conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment, in order to ensure the uninterrupted continuity of the heritage of the Three Jewels
They journey through all buddhafields In order to bring benefit to living beings, Yet they see those fields as just like empty space, Free of any conceptual notions of ‘living beings.
The fearless bodhisattvas can manifest, All in a single instant, The forms, sounds, and manners of behavior Of all living beings
Invited by hundreds of thousands of living beings, All in the same country
They excel in all esoteric sciences, And in the many different crafts
And they bring forth the happiness Of all living beings
In the middle of great battles They remain impartial to both sides
For bodhisattvas of great strength Delight in reconciliation of conflict
They intentionally become courtesans In order to win men over
And, having caught them with the hook of desire, They establish them in the buddha
They become invincible champions For the sake of the proud and the vain
And, having conquered all their pride, They start them on the quest for enlightenment
They always stand at the head Of those terrified with fright
And, having bestowed fearlessness upon them, They develop them toward enlightenment
Except for some inferior living beings, Without any intelligence at all
Is there anyone with any discernment Who, having heard this teaching, Would not wish for the supreme enlightenment
Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti asked those bodhisattvas
Good sirs, please explain how the bodhisattvas enter the Dharma-door of nonduality
The bodhisattva Śrīkūṭa declared
‘I’ and ‘mine’ are two
When there is thorough knowledge of defilement, there will be no conceit about purification
The path leading to the complete conquest of all conceit is the entrance into nonduality
Not to presume or construct something is neither to establish its uniqueness nor to establish its characterlessness. To penetrate the equality of these two is to enter nonduality
has equanimity without any attainment of equanimity—he enters the absence of conceptual knots
Thus, he enters into nonduality
The bodhisattva Sukhādhimukta declared
To say, ‘this is happiness’ and ‘that is misery’ is dualism
To say, ‘this is mundane’ and ‘that is transcendental’ is dualism
Thus, neither to transcend nor to be involved, neither to go nor to stop
this is the entrance into nonduality
To understand the eye correctly, and not to have attachment, aversion, or confusion with regard to form—that is called ‘peace.
The egoistic views of aggregates, being unproduced themselves, do not exist ultimately. Hence such views do not really conceptualize ‘these are aggregates’ or ‘these aggregates cease.
Ultimately, they have no such discriminative constructions and no such conceptualizations. Therefore, such views have themselves the nature of cessation
These things have the nature of inactivity
for this knowledge is the entrance into nonduality
The non-undertaking of meritorious, sinful, and unmoving actions is not dualistic
The intrinsic nature of all such actions is voidness
wherein ultimately there is neither merit, nor sin, nor non-movement, nor action itself
At the time of absorption in cessation, there is neither darkness nor light
Liberation can be found where there is bondage
Living in such unconcern, he entertains no concepts of ‘path’ or ‘nonpath.
Understanding the nature of concepts, his mind does not engage in duality. Such is the entrance into nonduality
One does not see with the physical eye, one sees with the eye of wisdom
And with the wisdom-eye one sees only insofar as there is neither sight nor nonsight. There, where there is neither sight nor nonsight, is the entrance into nonduality
The crown prince Mañjuśrī applauded the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
Excellent! Excellent, noble sir
This is indeed the entrance into the nonduality of the bodhisattvas
In that universe, all the houses
the avenues, the parks, and the palaces are made of various perfumes
At this time, the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa sat down with his bodhisattvas to take his meal
and the deities called Gandha­vyūhāhāra, who were all devoted to the Mahāyāna, served and attended upon that Buddha and his bodhisattvas
where you will find the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa taking his meal
‘The Licchavi Vimalakīrti bows down one hundred thousand times at your feet, O Lord
and asks after your health—if you have but little trouble, little discomfort, little unrest; if you are strong, well, without complaint, and living in touch with supreme happiness.
Vimalakīrti asks the Lord to give me the remains of your meal
Then, those living beings who aspire to inferior ways may gain the intelligence to aspire to the great Dharma of the Buddha, an
the name of the Buddha will be celebrated far and wide
What does he mean by ‘those who aspire to inferior ways’
Having thus been questioned by those bodhisattvas
How great must that bodhisattva be himself if his magical incarnation is thus endowed with supernatural power, strength, and fearlessness
The Tathāgata said
Noble sons, a buddhafield is a field of pure space
but the lord buddhas, in order to develop living beings, do not reveal all at once the pure realm of the Buddha
Then, the incarnated bodhisattva gave the vessel full of food to Vimalakīrti
and the fragrance of that food permeated the entire great city of Vaiśāl
and its sweet perfume spread throughout one hundred universes
Within the city of Vaiśālī, the brahmins, householders, and even the Licchavi chieftain Candracchattra, having noticed this fragrance
were amazed and filled with wonder
they were filled with admiration and great joy
For example, the four great oceans might dry up, but this food would never be exhausted
Issued from inexhaustible morality, concentration, and wisdom, the remains of the food of the Tathāgata contained in this vessel cannot be exhausted
Good sirs, these living beings here are hard to discipline
This is miserliness, and this is its effect
This is affliction and that is purification
This is life and that is liberation
Thus, by means of these varied explanations of the Dharma, the Buddha trains the minds of those living beings who are just like wild horses
Thus is established the greatness of the Buddha Śākyamuni
he civilizes the wild living beings who are poor and inferior
Good sirs, in this Sahā universe, there are ten virtuous practices that do not exist in any other buddhafield
Mañjuśrī, let us take these many living beings into the presence of the Lord, so that they may see the Tathāgata and bow down to him
The Buddha said to Śāriputra
Śāriputra, did you see the miraculous performances of the bodhisattvas, those best of beings
What concept did you produce toward them
Lord, I produced the concept of inconceivability toward them
Their activities appeared inconceivable to me to the point that I was unable to think of them, to judge them, or even to imagine them
Where does the perfume come from
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti obtained some food from the universe called Sarva­gandha­sugandhā, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa, and this perfume emanates from the bodies of all those who partook of that food
Until it is digested
When will it be digested
It will be digested in forty-nine days
Similarly, reverend Ānanda
this food is not digested until all the poisons of the passions have been eliminated—only then is it digested
Ānanda! There are buddhafields that accomplish the buddha-work by means of bodhisattvas, those that do so by means of lights, those that do so by means of the tree of enlightenment, those that do so by means of the physical beauty and the marks of the Tathāgata, those that do so by means of religious robes, those that do so by means of food, those that do so by means of water, those that do so by means of gardens, those that do so by means of palaces, those that do so by means of mansions, those that do so by means of magical incarnations, those that do so by means of empty space, and those that do so by means of lights in the sky. Why is it so, Ānanda? Because by these various means, living beings become disciplined
Similarly, Ānanda
there are buddhafields that accomplish the buddha-work by means of teaching living beings words, definitions, and analogies, such as ‘dreams,’ ‘images,’ the ‘reflection of the moon in water,’ ‘echoes,’ ‘illusions,’ and ‘mirages’
and there are those that accomplish the buddha-work by making words understandable
Also, Ānanda, there are utterly pure buddhafields that accomplish the buddha-work for living beings without speech, by silence, inexpressibility, and unteachability
Finally, Ānanda, the buddhas accomplish the buddha-work by means of the four māras and all the eighty-four thousand types of passion that afflict living beings
there are none that do not accomplish the buddha-work, because all discipline living beings
The bodhisattva who enters this Dharma-doo
when confronted by a buddhafield adorned with the splendor of all noble qualities
Ānanda, all the buddhas are the same as to the perfection of their buddha-qualities: that is, their forms, their colors, their radiance, their bodies, their marks, their nobility, their morality, their concentration, their wisdom, their liberation, their gnosis and vision of liberation, their strengths, their fearlessnesses, their special buddha-qualities, their great love, their great compassion, their helpful intentions, their attitudes, their practices, their paths, the lengths of their lives, their teachings of the Dharma, their development and liberation of living beings, and their purification of buddhafields
Therefore, they are all called ‘saṃyaksaṃbuddhas,’ ‘tathāgatas,’ and ‘buddhas.
Also, Ānanda, if all the living beings of this billion-world galactic universe were like you—the foremost of the learned and the foremost of those endowed with memory and incantations
and were they to devote an entire eon, they would still be unable to understand completely the exact and extensive meaning of the three words ‘saṃyaksaṃbuddha,’ ‘tathāgata,’ and ‘buddha.
I pronounced you, Ānanda, the foremost of the learned, with the disciples in mind, not considering the bodhisattvas
Ānanda, one can fathom the depths of the ocean, but one cannot fathom the depths of the wisdom, gnosis, memory, incantations, or eloquence of the bodhisattvas
Ānanda, these marvels displayed in a single morning by the Licchavi Vimalakīrt
could not be performed by the disciples and solitary sages who have attained miraculous powers, were they to devote all their powers of incarnation and transformation during one hundred thousand millions of eons
Lord, the realms of the buddhas and their skill in liberative art are inconceivable
making reasonable those whose passions are excessive
taking pleasure in solitude, without being attached to it
offering limitless pure sacrifices to fulfill the auspicious marks and signs; adorning body, speech, and mind by refraining from all sins
continuing in reincarnations during immeasurable eons, while purifying body, speech, and mind
avoiding discouragement, through spiritual heroism, when learning of the immeasurable virtues of the Buddha
to chastise the enemy afflictions
wielding the sharp sword of wisdo
knowing well the aggregates, the elements, and the sense-media in order to bear the burdens of all living beings
not mixing with worldly things in order to delight all the people
being faultless in all activities in order to conform to all people
producing the superknowledges to actually accomplish all duties of benefit to living beings
in order to retain all learning
acquiring incantations, memory, and knowledg
He considers selflessness, yet does not abandon the great compassion toward all living beings
He considers motionlessness, yet he moves in order to develop all living beings
He considers vanity, futility, insubstantiality, dependency, and placelessness, ye
he establishes himself on merits that are not vain, on knowledge that is not futile, on reflections that are substantial, on the striving for the consecration of the independent gnosis, and on the buddha lineage in its definitive meaning
In order to worship the Buddha Śākyamuni and the bodhisattvas of the Sahā universe, as well as this teaching
they covered the whole earth of this billion-world galactic universe with fragrant powder, incense, perfumes, and flowers up to the height of the knees
Thus addressed, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the Buddha
He is the essence that is the reality of matter
The Tathāgata has reached the extreme of detachment in regard to all things
yet he is not a reality-limit
He abides in ultimate reality, yet there is no relationship between it and him
He is neither here, nor there, nor anywhere else
He is neither this nor that
He is not a whole, nor a conglomeration
yet equal to the ultimate reality of things
He is matchless, especially in effort
He is not seen, heard, distinguished, or known
He is without any complexity
without conception, and without intellectualization
He is without activity, without birth
without occurrence, without origin
without production, and without nonproduction
Vimalakīrti declared
Is there anything among the things that you see, elder, that dies or is reborn
There is nothing that dies or is reborn
Likewise, reverend Śāriputra, as all things neither die nor are reborn, why do you ask, “Where did you die to reincarnate here?
Noble sir, a magical creation does not die, nor is it reborn
Reverend Śāriputra, did not the Tathāgata declare that all things have the nature of a magical creation
Yes, noble sir, that is indeed so
Reverend Śāriputra, since all things have the nature of a magical creation, why do you ask, “Where have you died to reincarnate here?
Lord, it is wonderful that this holy person, having left a buddhafield as pure as Abhirati, should enjoy a buddhafield as full of defects as this Sahā universe
Does the light of the sun accompany the darkness
Certainly not
Then the two do not go together
Then why does the sun rise over the world
It rises to illuminate the world, and to eliminate the darkness
Just in the same way, reverend Śāriputra, the bodhisattva reincarnates voluntarily in the impure buddhafields in order to purify the living beings, in order to make the light of wisdom shine, and in order to clear away the darkness
Thereupon, the entire multitude experienced the desire to behold the universe Abhirati, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya, his bodhisattvas, and his great disciples
Without rising from my couch
the universe Abhirati an
its moon, its sun, and its stars
its devas, nāgas, yakṣas
its villages, cities, towns, provinces, kingdoms, men, women, and houses
Thereupon, the Buddha Śākyamuni asked all the multitudes
Friends, behold the splendors of the universe Abhirati, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya, the array of his buddhafield, and the splendors of these disciples and bodhisattvas
They replied
We see them, Lord
Those bodhisattvas who wish to embrace such a buddhafield should educate themselves in all the bodhisattva-practices of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya
with his miraculous power, showed them thus the universe Abhirati and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya
one hundred and forty thousand living beings among the men and gods of the Sahā universe conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
all of them formed a prayer to be reborn in the universe Abhirati
and the Buddha prophesied that in the future all would be reborn in the universe Abhirati
having thus developed all the living beings who could thereby be developed
returned the universe Abhirati exactly to its former place
The Lord then said to the venerable Śāriputra
Śāriputra, did you see that universe Abhirati, and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya
I saw it, Lord
May all living beings come to live in a buddhafield as splendid as that
May all living beings come to have miraculous powers just like those of the noble Licchavi Vimalakīrti
We have gained great benefit from having seen a holy man such as he
We have gained a great benefit from having heard such teaching of the Dharma, whether the Tathāgata himself still actually exists or whether he has already attained ultimate liberation
Hence, there is no need to mention the great benefit for those who, having heard it, believe it, rely on it, embrace it, remember it, read it, and penetrate to its depth, and, having found faith in it, teach, recite, and show it to others and apply themselves to the yoga of meditation upon its teaching
Those living beings who understand correctly this teaching of the Dharma will obtain the treasury of the jewels of the Dharma
Those who study correctly this teaching of the Dharma will become the companions of the Tathāgata
Those who honor and serve the adepts of this doctrine will be the true protectors of the Dharma
Those who write, teach, and worship this teaching of the Dharma will be visited by the Tathāgata in their homes
Those who take pleasure in this teaching of the Dharma will embrace all merits
Those who teach it to others, whether it be no more than a single stanza of four lines, or a single summary phrase from this teaching of the Dharma
will be performing the great Dharma-sacrifice
And those who devote to this teaching of the Dharma their tolerance, their zeal, their intelligence, their discernment, their vision, and their aspirations
thereby become subject to the prophesy of future Buddhahood
Then Śakra, the king of the gods, said to the Buddha
Lord, formerly I have heard from the Tathāgata and from Mañjuśrī, the crown prince of wisdom, many hundreds of thousands of teachings of the Dharma, bu
I have never before heard a teaching of the Dharma as remarkable as this instruction in the entrance into the method of inconceivable transformations
Lord, those living beings who, having heard this teaching of the Dharma, accept it, remember it, read it, and understand it deeply will be, without a doubt, true vessels of the Dharma
To the villages, towns, cities, states, kingdoms, and capitals wherein this teaching of the Dharma will be applied, taught, and demonstrated
I and my followers will come to hear the Dharma
Therefore, king of gods
when noble sons and daughters accept it, repeat it, understand it deeply, write it completely, and, making it into a book, honor it
pay homage to the buddhas of the past, present, and future
Let us suppose, king of gods, that this billion-world galactic universe were as full of tathāgatas as it is covered with groves of sugarcane, with rosebushes, with bamboo thickets, with sesame gardens, and with flowers, and that a noble son or daughter were to honor them, revere them, respect and adore them, offering them all sorts of comforts and offerings for an eon or more than an eon
And let us suppose that, these tathāgatas having entered ultimate liberation
he or she honored each of them by enshrining their preserved bodies in a memorial stūpa made of precious stones, each as large as a world with four great continents
Have faith, king of gods, and understand this
whoever accepts this exposition of the Dharma called Instruction in the Inconceivable Liberation, recites it, and understands it deeply, he or she will gather merits even greater than those who perform the above acts
what do you think, king of gods
Would that noble son or daughter receive much merit as a consequence of such activities
Many merits, Lord! Many merits, O Sugata
Were one to spend hundreds of thousands of millions of eons, it would be impossible to measure the limit of the mass of merit
Once, king of gods, long ago, long before eons more numerous than the innumerable, immense, immeasurable, inconceivable, and even before then
in the eon called Vicaraṇa in the universe called Mahāvyūha
the Tathāgata called Bhaiṣajyarāja appeared in the world: an arhat, perfectly and fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, knower of the world, incomparable knower of men who need to be civilized, teacher of gods and men, a lord, a buddha
This King Ratnacchattra honored the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja and his retinue with many excellent offerings during five short eons
King Ratnacchattra said to his sons
‘Recognizing that during my reign I have worshiped the Tathāgata, in your turn you also should worship him
The thousand princes gave their consent, obeying their father the king, an
all together, during another five short eons, they honored the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja with all sorts of excellent offerings
Among them, there was a prince by the name of Candracchattra, who retired into solitude and thought to himself
Is there not another mode of worship, even better and more noble than this
Then, by the supernatural power of the Buddha Bhaiṣajyarāja, the gods spoke to him from the heavens
Good man, go to the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, ask him about “Dharma-worship,” an
Lord, I have heard of a “Dharma-worship,” which surpasses all other worship. What is this “Dharma-worship”
They are subtle, precise, and ultimately incomprehensible
hey reveal the irreversible wheel of Dharma, arising from the six transcendences
They contain the message of selflessness, living-beinglessness, lifelessness, personlessness, voidness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonperformance, nonproduction, and nonoccurrence
They preserve unbroken the heritage of the holy Dharma, contain the treasury of the Dharma, and represent the summit of Dharma-worship
They are upheld by all holy beings and teach all the bodhisattva practices
They bring emancipation through teaching the epitomes of the Dharma, and the impermanence, misery, selflessness, and peace of all things
They are the medicines for the tendencies of mundane life
and they authentically manifest the great happiness of liberation. To teach correctly, to uphold, to investigate, and to understand such sūtras
applying the Dharma according to the Dharma
in harmony with relativity
being free of extremist convictions
attaining the tolerance of ultimate birthlessness and nonoccurrence of all things
realizing selflessness and living-beinglessness
realizing the ultimate absence of any fundamental consciousness; and overcoming the habit of clinging to an ultimate ground
Finally, attaining peace by stopping everything from ignorance to old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, anxiety, and trouble, an
realizing that living beings know no end to their views concerning these twelve links of dependent origination—then
noble son, when you do not hold to any view at all, that is called unexcelled Dharma-worship
Then, king of gods, the prince Candracchattra, out of his great faith in the Tathāgata, left the household life in order to enter the homeless life of a monk and
lived making great effort toward the attainment of virtue
Having made great effort and being well established in virtue, he soon produced the five superknowledges, understood the incantations, and obtained invincible eloquence
When the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja attained ultimate liberation, Candracchattra, on the strength of his superknowledges and by the power of his incantations, made the wheel of the Dharma turn just as the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja had done and continued to do so for ten short eons
King of gods, while the monk Candracchattra was exerting himself thus to protect the holy Dharma, thousands of millions of living beings reached the stage of irreversibility on the path to unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
fourteen billion living beings were disciplined in the vehicles of the disciples and solitary sages
Perhaps, king of gods, you are wondering or experiencing some doubt about whether or not, at that former time, the King Ratnacchattra was not some other than the actual Tathāgata Ratnārcis
You must not imagine that
the present Tathāgata Ratnārcis was at that time, in that epoch, the universal monarch Ratnacchattra
Perhaps, king of gods, you are asking yourself if, in that life, in that time, the Prince Candracchattra who upheld the holy Dharma of Lord Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja was not someone other than myself
But you must not imagine that
I was, in that life, in that time, the Prince Candracchattra
Maitreya, in the future there will be noble sons and daughters, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras, who, having planted the roots of virtue
will conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
If they do not hear this teaching of the Dharma, they will certainly lose boundless advantages and even perish
But if they hear such a teaching, they will rejoice, will believe, an
will accept it upon the crowns of their heads. Hence, in order to protect those future noble sons and daughters
you must spread a teaching such as this
Maitreya, it must be known that the bodhisattvas who believe in all sorts of words and phrases, and apply themselves accordingly, are beginners and not experienced in religious practice
But the bodhisattvas who read, hear, believe, and teach this profound teaching with its impeccable expressions reconciling dichotomies and its analyses of stages of development—these are veterans in the religious practice
What are these two
Hearing this profound teaching never before heard, they are terrified and doubtful, do not rejoice, an
reject it, thinking, ‘Whence comes this teaching never before heard?
They then behold other noble sons accepting, becoming vessels for, and teaching this profound teaching
and they do not attend upon them, do not befriend them, do not respect them, and do not honor them, and eventually they go so far as to criticize them
There are two reasons the bodhisattvas who do aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselves and do not attain the tolerance of the ultimate birthlessness of things
These bodhisattvas despise and reproach the beginner bodhisattvas, who have not been practicing for a long time, and they do not initiate them or instruct them in the profound teaching. Having no great respect for this profound teaching, they are not careful about its rules
I will instill in them the power of memory with which they may, having believed in this teaching, retain it, recite it, penetrate its depths, teach it, propagate it, write it down, and proclaim it extensively to others
Your word is well given
Lord, in all the towns, villages, cities, kingdoms, and palaces, wherever this discourse of the Dharma will be practised, upheld, and correctly taught
we, the four great kings, will go there with our armies, our young warriors, and our retinues, to hear the Dharma
Receive then, Ānanda, this expression of the teaching of the Dharma
Remember it, and teach it widely and correctly to others
I have memorized, Lord, this expression of the teaching of the Dharma. But what is the name of this teaching
Ānanda, this exposition of the Dharma is called The Teaching of Vimalakīrti, or The Reconciliation of Dichotomies, or even Section of the Inconceivable Liberation. Remember it thus

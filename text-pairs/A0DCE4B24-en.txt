Swift Enlightened Activity A Concise Ceremony of Offering and Prayer to Mahākāla and Consort
From oṃ appears the vessel of the perfectly expansive kapāla ,
From āḥ the five meats and five nectars appear,
And are transformed with hūṃ into immaculate wisdom nectar,
Then, through ha , ho and hrīḥ , this expands to fill the whole of space.
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ ha ho hrīḥ
From the realm of Akaniṣṭha and the Vajra Seat (Bodh Gaya) in India,
From the Cool Grove and other sacred places and charnel grounds,
Come, Vajra-Pañjaranātha, foremost guardian of the teachings,
And Ekajaṭī, Śrīdevī (Palden Lhamo),
Almighty Kṣetrapāla, the father and mother yakṣa consorts,
Putrabhadra, Bhaginī, Citipati,
The yakṣa sisters, and others—
An ocean-like assembly of oath-bound guardians of the three classes of tantra, along with their retinues.
To you all, we offer these samaya substances, this great offering-torma of nectar,
And these delightful gifts, substances that fulfil our sacred bond,
Filling the whole of the earth, the heavens and space between.
Accept these with delight, and carry out your activity,
Ensuring that the precious teachings of the buddhas never wane, but flourish and spread!
Cause the asura s, barbarians and those who are hostile to the teachings
To be reduced to dust, like dry grass consumed in a fiery blaze!
Swiftly bring about their eradication, their annihilation, we pray!
Care for us, the yogic practitioners and all those around us,
Lovingly, as a mother cares for her only child,
And cause all our wishes to be effortlessly fulfilled.
Protect us and provide us with refuge always—in this life, future lives, and the bardo state.
Cause us to behold the true face of the glorious Guru Mahākāla,
Our very own rigpa, and thereby swiftly reach the state of Vajradhara,
And grant us the supreme and common accomplishments,
Including the capacity to liberate all beings!

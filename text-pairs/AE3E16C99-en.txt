Mountain of Freshest Saffron: A Long-Life Prayer 1
Oṃ svasti.
Beautiful as a mountain of freshest saffron, you
Hold the blue sword that cuts through unknowing
And the profound volume upon the bed of a blue lotus—
Guru Mañjughoṣa, to you I pray.
Holder of the omniscient Sage’s precious teachings,
The great treasury of sūtra and mantra Dharma,
Your fame and reputation extend throughout the world,
Great intelligent one, Lodrö, may your life remain secure.
Through the power and truth of praying in this way,
May the venerable guru’s life long remain secure,
May all the ills of this age be healed throughout the world,
And may all be auspicious, so that the teachings and those who uphold them may flourish and thrive.

Aspiration for the Spread of the Guhyagarbha Teachings
Oṃ svasti.
Fundamental realization of all the victorious ones of the three times,
Quintessence of the inner tantric vehicles, great Magical Illusion,
The real meaning of the glorious Secret Essence tantra—
May its study and practice spread throughout the world!
May we realize the meaning of the dharmakāya, the two truths indivisible,
May the music of the samādhi of great purity and equalness resound,
May we gain the results of the path, the four levels of a vidyādhara,
And may we ultimately attain the sovereign domain of Vajrasattva!
Through the power of the natural truth of this, the king of tantras,
May all the faults and failings of these evil times be pacified,
And may all be auspicious for the teachings of Buddhism in general
And this definitive Secret Essence in particular to spread far and wide!

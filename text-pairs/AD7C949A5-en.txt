The Music of Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
Oṃ svasti!
Powerful in speech, you know all that is to be known,
And, like the sun, light up the victorious Lobzang Drakpa’s tradition,
Supreme crown jewel amidst all the infinite holders of the teachings in this snowy land—
I pray that your life may be secure until the very end of existence!
Master of virtuous qualities and the nine ways of the saintly,
Pre-eminent through the seven riches of the noble ones,
King of Dharma, with authority over the three planes of existence,
Master of all that is taught in this world—I pray that your life may be secure!
Guide to all wandering beings, protector without equal,
Through the radiant splendour of your supreme secret body, speech and mind,
May the glory of the four aspects of well-being—worldly values, wealth, pleasure and liberation—increase,
And may the precious teachings flourish and spread far and wide!

Marmé Mönlam: The Light Offering Prayer
Hūṃ! You who embody all the buddhas of past, present and future,
Noble One who Dispels the Darkness of Ignorance, with all your deities,
Master, vajra sovereigns and your consorts,
Vast, ocean-like gathering of brothers and sisters:
All of you, without exception, look upon us with your love, and
Remaining here in this maṇḍala of supreme enlightenment,
Bear witness to the accomplishment of our aspirations and prayers!
Vajra Sovereigns, glorious embodiments of all buddhas,
Supreme consorts of the buddhas, the mothers who give birth to the buddhas,
Emanations of their wisdom mind, sons of the buddhas, holders of the teaching of the awakened mind of bodhicitta,
Brothers and sisters, gathering of vidyādharas who share one and the same samaya,
From now on, until enlightenment is realized,
Without ever separating, remain as the jewel ornament on the crown of my head!
When all past, present and future perceptions of my body, speech and mind,
Even those of dream and sleep, arise
May I see them as the guru and consort, and vajra brothers and sisters
May I please your body, speech and mind,
And serve you with the deepest devotion and respect!
When perceptions of this life fade away, and
At the moment of death, when first the dharmakāya luminosity dawns,
Having recognised, perfected the strength and gained stability,
By not separating from the ‘Limitless Light’ of dharmakāya Amitābha,
May I be liberated into the dharmakāya space of primordial purity!
If my rigpa has not perfected its own risings into dharmakāya
And perceptions and awareness of the bardo arise as self-appearing deities,
Introducing my own mind to its own pure energy, and
Manifesting as sound, colour, light and radiance, with its own self-sound,
May I be liberated into the pure saṃbhogakāya realm complete with its five certainties!
So, if my rigpa does not mature into its fullness,
And I am distracted by the delusory appearances of the bardo of becoming,
By remembering the Vajra Sovereign and his consort,
And by virtue of this lamp of appearance and luminosity,
Completely surrounded by a gathering of vīras and ḍākinīs,
May I be liberated into the pure celestial domain!
Whilst I see the realms of the six classes of beings dominated by their past karma,
And I wander in this saṃsāra, driven by habitual tendencies,
Through practising together these profound generation and completion phases,
I have obtained a free and well-favoured human body;
Through the auspicious tendrel of gathering in this one maṇḍala,
And through the samādhi of focusing on this one lamp,
May we all unite in the one mandala gathering, and never separate!
At that time, transforming into the noble, supreme chosen deity,
And through the loving kindness of the vajra master,
May my mindstream be penetrated by perfect hearing, contemplation and meditation, and
Pacifying all harm and dangers, through practising according to the Dharma,
May I realize the ultimate fruition of accomplishment!
As one who holds the supreme jewel of the two siddhis,
In the realms of the six classes of impure beings,
Whether as a warrior, merchant, low caste or priest,
Labourer, woman, child or śramaṇa,
A sage, expert in all kinds of learning,
Born in a family of honour or disrepute,
Low or high, invalid or teacher of Buddhadharma,
Bird or beast or beggar in the city—
Teaching each and every being, in whichever way they need,
May I take on different forms in order to train beings!
Generosity, pleasing speech, the right message, and beneficial behaviour:
Keeping to these four ways of attracting disciples,
And skilled in an immeasurable number of methods,
May I pour down a rain of Dharma, according to the needs of each one,
Liberate the six classes of beings, my fathers and mothers, from saṃsāra
And be a lamp to dispel the darkness of ignorance!
Since all that appears and exists, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, is from the very beginning perfectly contained within the expanse of dharmadhātu,
And ignorance when purified is the naturally arisen supreme vajra,
May all beings, effortlessly, as one,
Be indivisible from the yidam, the Lord of Buddha families,
And obtain the fruition of nonduality!

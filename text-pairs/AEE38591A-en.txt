The Chariot of the Vidyādharas An Aspiration Prayer for Travelling to the Realm of Lotus Light
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
The wisdom of the great, indestructible sphere
Shines in the limpid sky of innate clear light,
And the unity of space and wisdom, like a rainbow, appears for all to see
As the supreme, naturally emanated realm of Lotus Light.
In an expanse of rings of rainbow light, the direct realization of dharmatā,
Rises the great mansion, the increasing of experience,
Where throngs of ḍākas and ḍākinīs, awareness reaching fullness,
Enact vajra dances and song, the exhaustion of phenomena beyond the mind.
In its centre preside the primordial lord Amitābha,
The great treasure of compassion, Padmapāṇi,
And the three kāyas all-embodied, the immortal Tötreng Tsal,
With his eight principal emanations and others, all manifesting to tame beings each in their own way.
Here, in this gathering-place of the great magical net
Of your infinite display of aspects and forms,
May I and others, the ocean of sentient beings pervading space,
All be born the instant we depart this life.
Once there, taking the special path of the four vidyādhara stages,
May we swiftly attain the level of the Lake-born Guru,
Who embodies oceans of kāyas and wisdom,
And spontaneously fulfil the benefit of ourselves and others!

Prayer to Sé Pakchok Dorje
Namo guru!
In the palace of great bliss, aware and empty luminosity,
The self-arisen dharmakāya is the full strength of awareness.
Guru and pervasive sovereign Samantabhadra, to you I pray:
Inspire me to realize the Trekchö of primordial purity.
In the palace of unceasing natural luminosity and self-radiance,
Is the spontaneously present sambhogakāya guru, to whom I pray:
Inspire me to complete the supreme path of four luminous visions
And accomplish the rainbow body of great transference.
In the pure nirmāṇakāya realm of the creative power of awareness,
Is the Tulku Kunzang Pakchok Dorje,
To whom I pray with uninterrupted awareness and presence:
Inspire me to bring unlimited benefit to beings.
May I recognise my own awareness as the very essence of all refuges,
Attain full awakening within the nature of the indestructible vajra,
The space of the youthful vase body in which the three kāyas are spontaneously present,
And empty the three realms of saṃsāra from their very depths.

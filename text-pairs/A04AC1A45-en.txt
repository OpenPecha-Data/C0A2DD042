The Flower of Auspiciousness A Prayer for the Long Life of Khenpo Khyenrab Chökyi Özer, Masterful Expositor of Scripture and Reasoning
Namo mañjuśrīye!
Embodiment of the wisdom of all the buddhas throughout the whole of space,
Guru and treasury of perfect knowledge, Mañjuvajra,
Dispel the darkness that benights the beings every time and place,
And increase their stores of intelligence and confident eloquence.
In the Dharma grove of scripture and realization, teaching and practice,
You are the true friend whose lotus-like intellect has fully bloomed,
Peerless in exposition of the well-expressed and perfect teachings,
Sun-like lord of scholars, I pray that your life remain secure.
You spread the tradition of Kunga even to the far reaches of the ocean,
And hoist the victory-banner of the teachings to the very summit of existence,
You whose beneficent activity is victorious over all,
Continue to spread the teachings of the Jamgön Lama, I pray.
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May the guru's life remain stable and endure,
May his dharmic activity extend throughout the three worlds,
And the celebration of benefit and happiness spread far and wide.

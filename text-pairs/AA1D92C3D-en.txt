The Wisdom Mind Practice of One Kīla The Invocation
When vajra wrath is aroused, aggression is cut right through.
The great weapon of compassion, the blazing blue ( syllable hūṃ )
Arises and hangs, like a drop, in ( empty ) space,
The life force of the whole universe, brilliantly radiant,
Visualized in the centre of my heart
The great samaya of ‘liberating through compassion’.
It is neither killing ( out of anger ) nor suppressing ( out of ignorance ).
My whole body is transformed into vajra
And my consciousness is transformed into its true nature,
Oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya hūṃ phaṭ
The wisdom body of all the buddhas.
From the great peace of the vajra dharmadhātu
Blazing and unbearably wrathful
I assume the precious body of Vajrakumāra.
From out of the unborn dharmatā
( Arises ) its unceasing display: the wrathful Vajrarakṣa
Dark blue, his two hands wielding the kīla,
In union with his consort Diptacakra
Amidst the blazing fire ( of wisdom ), like the inferno at the end of a kalpa.
Clearly visualized, the radiant, naturally arising wisdom body.
Hūṃ! Vidyādharas of Vajrakumāra:
Actualize this existence as ( the maṇḍala ) of Vajra( kīla )!
Deities of ( the maṇḍala of ) the Vajrakīla of existence:
Actualize the wisdom wrath!
Oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya sarva vighnān baṃ hūṃ phaṭ
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ Oṃ āh hūṃ
Hūṃ! To accomplish the kīla of existence
And receive empowerments and siddhis,
I invoke the wisdom wrath of Vajrakīla—may you descend!
And, having come,
Enjoy this tsok and torma offering, ornamented by the sensual stimulants, and
This great mudrā of offering!
Show me the actual signs and marks of accomplishment, and
Especially, grant me the siddhis of Kīlaya!
All the attendants and messengers, the protectors of Vajrakīla, who obey commands—
Accept this remainder torma
And, just as you pledged at an earlier time,
Carry out the activities which we command!

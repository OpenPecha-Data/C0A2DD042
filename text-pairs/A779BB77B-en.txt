Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
Single embodiment of the knowledge, love and power
Of Mañjughoṣa and the rest—all the Victors and their heirs.
Master of the learned and accomplished, glorious guru,
To you I offer heartfelt prayer: hold me in your compassion.
May those arising as nirmāṇakāya from the dharma-sphere
Gain total victory in the battle over obstacles and māras.
May they abide within the very essence of the three vajras
And bring magnificent benefit to the teachings and to beings.

Prayer for the Long Life of Pema Norbu, Lord of Siddhas
O protector, although in the past, countless aeons ago,
You were awakened as the essence of Palchen Düpa,
Still, through the infinite magic of acting with skillful means,
You appear now in this realm as the supreme spiritual guide.
Lord among accomplished ones, Pema Norbu,
May your life remain secure within the essence of Amitāyus!
Through the power and truth of the Three Jewels, Three Roots and guardian deities,
May all the visionary aims and wishes within this master's enlightened mind
Be swiftly and easily accomplished — grant your blessings so that it is so!
May the community of the saṅgha live in harmony and with pure discipline,
Always engaging in study and teaching and practice,
And may everything be auspicious so that all beings live in happiness and joy!

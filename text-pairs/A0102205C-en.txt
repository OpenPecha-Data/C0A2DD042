Prayer to My Root Guru, Jamyang Loter Wangpo
All-pervasive sovereign, lord of secrets, Vajra Holder,
Chief of the maṇḍalas of the infinite, ocean-like tantras,
To think of you allays the anxieties of existence and quiescence—
Jamyang Loter Wangpo, to you I pray.
Seeing your form brings the wisdom of great bliss;
Hearing your voice dispels the darkness of ignorance;
Recalling your mind reveals the dharmakāya of my own awareness—
Glorious guru, at your feet I pray.
Guru heruka, glorious Vajradhara,
Do not neglect me in your compassion,
But eradicate the delusion of my three doors
And cause the wisdom of the three vajras to mature.

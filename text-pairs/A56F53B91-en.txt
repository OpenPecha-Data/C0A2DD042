A Garland of Utpala Flowers Prayer to the Masters of the Lineage of Zabtik Drolchok
Dharmakāya prajñāpāramitā, the conqueror Samantabhadrī;
Perfect saṃbhogakāya Vajravārāhī;
And nirmāṇakāya display, venerable mother Tārā,
Pray, grant me supreme and ordinary attainments!
Padmākara, who is the second Buddha,
Chief of the hundred thousand ḍākinīs who hold the treasury of secret mantra,
Princely bodhisattva Rolpa Tsal,
Pray, grant me supreme and ordinary attainments!
Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa, revealer of profound treasures,
Dorjé Ziji Tsal, 1 master of the seven authoritative transmissions, 2
And Pema Garwang, 3 who clarified the Victorious One’s teaching,
Pray, grant me supreme and ordinary attainments!
And holders of the treasury of ripening and liberating, profound and vast,
Root teachers of the lineage, noble goddess swift to act,
Oceanic deities of the three roots and vajra dharma protectors,
Pray, grant me supreme and ordinary attainments!
Saturate the ground of my mind with renunciation,
So that sprouts of excellent intention may burgeon,
And bear plentiful fruits of great primordial wisdom,
As we spontaneously accomplish the twofold purpose!

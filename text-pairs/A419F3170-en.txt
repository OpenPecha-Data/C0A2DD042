Prayer of Transference 1
In the sky in front, amidst a captivating expanse of dense rainbow light,
Upon a lion throne and seats of lotus and lunar disc
Is my own root guru in the form of the protector Amitābha,
Entirely surrounded by oceanic hosts of the sources of refuge.
All of them abide with loving affection for me,
The object of focus, and all beings.
Now that this object of focus, who has not yet put a stop to the delusory perceptions
Of birth, death and the bardo, has passed on, let their consciousness
Be transferred through the path of deathlessness like a shooting star
And dissolve into the precious guru’s heart.
Through the compassionate blessings of the oceanic sources of refuge
And the power of this yogi’s pure altruistic intention,
May their deluded mind and the precious guru’s wisdom
Rest without contrivance in non-dual great equanimity: āḥ!
May this be the cause of purifying negative karma, misdeeds and obscurations,
So that the terrifying delusory appearances of the bardos do not arise,
And this person may continue their pursuit of virtue in a pure realm
And swiftly attain perfect buddhahood!

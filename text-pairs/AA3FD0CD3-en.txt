Prayer to Thangtong Gyalpo
Namo guru!
Subduer of māra's forces, in your wrathful form with its dark complexion,
Confident in the view, you maintain the unconventional actions of a yogi,
Prophesied by the Oḍḍiyāna Guru, you are a supreme being a nirmāṇakāya:
Thangtong Gyalpo, 'King of the Empty Plain', to you I pray!
The peaceful, supreme and noble Great Compassionate One
And the wrathful, king of the fearsome, Hayagrīva,
Are inseparably united in you, the supreme manifestation:
Supreme sovereign of siddhas, to you I pray!
Prophesied by the victorious ones, venerable Tsöndrü Zangpo,
You practised yogic conduct throughout the lands of India and Tibet,
And became renowned as Thangtong Gyalpo, 'King of the Empty Plain':
Like a second guru of Oḍḍiyāna, to you I pray!
You sponsored supports of enlightened body, speech and mind,
The construction of bridges and so on — boundless acts of merit,
Bringing signs of virtue like the unheralded dawn of a new sun,
Mahāsiddha, Lord of Dharma, to you I pray!
Through the power of praying reverently to you,
In the places where I and others reside
May illness, harmful influences, poverty and conflict be relieved,
And may Dharma thrive and auspiciousness increase!

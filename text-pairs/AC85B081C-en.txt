The Verses of the Eight Noble Auspicious Ones
Oṃ! Homage to the Buddha, Dharma and Noble Saṅgha—
All that dwell in the auspicious realms of the ten directions,
Where appearance and existence is completely pure, its nature spontaneously perfect,
May everything be auspicious for us all!
King of Lamps, Steadfast and Powerful One Whose Vision Fulfils All Aims,
Glorious Ornament of Love, Sacred Splendour Renowned for Virtue,
The One Whose Concern for All Brings Him Universal Renown,
Glorious One as Renowned as Mount Meru in Eminence and Might,
Glorious One Renowned as Caring for All Sentient Beings,
Glorious One Renowned as Most Powerful in Satisfying Wishes—
Homage to you, the Eight Sugatas,
Merely hearing your names increases auspiciousness and success!
Youthful Mañjuśrī, glorious Vajrapāṇi,
Lord Avalokiteśvara, protector Maitreya,
Kṣitigarbha, Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin,
Ākāśagarbha, and Samantabhadra noblest of all—
Utpala ﬂower, vajra, white lotus, nāga-tree,
Jewel, moon, sword and sun—
Gracefully holding your emblems, and supreme in granting auspiciousness and success,
Homage to you, the Eight Bodhisattvas!
The most precious umbrella, the auspicious golden fishes,
The wish-fulﬁlling vase of goodness, the exquisite kamala flower,
The conch of fame and glory, the glorious knot of prosperity,
The eternal banner of victory and the all-powerful wheel:
Holding these eight most precious emblems
Are the creators of delight, making offerings to the buddhas of all directions and times.
Homage to you, the Eight Auspicious Goddesses—Beauty, Garlands, Song, Dance, Flowers, Incense, Light and Perfume—
Merely thinking of you makes success grow more and more!
Mighty Brahmā, Śiva 1 and Viṣṇu,
Indra the thousand-eyed, the kings Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Virūdhaka, Virūpakṣa the lord of nāgas,
And Vaiśravaṇa—each one holding your divine emblem:
Wheel, trident, lance, vajra,
Vīṇā, sword, stūpa and banner of victory—
Homage to you, the Eight Guardians of the World,
Who make auspiciousness and positivity grow in the three realms!
With all obstacles and harmful influences paciﬁed,
May the work we are now about to begin
Meet with ever-growing fulﬁlment and success, and
Bring good fortune, prosperity, happiness and peace!

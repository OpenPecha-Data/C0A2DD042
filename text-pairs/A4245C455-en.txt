A Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Tenpai Nyima Rinpoche
Oá¹ƒ svasti!
Through the power and truth of the unfailing rare and supreme ones together with their heirs,
And the force of the enlightened aspirations of the Lake-born Conqueror in particular,
May the supreme emanation of this incomparable guru, the Sun of the Teachings,
Appear like a youthful moon, swiftly and unmistakably!
In the dense darkness of this exceedingly degenerate age,
When the light of joy for the teachings and beings lies hidden,
May this sun, so powerful in its activity, like a king for all the world,
Swiftly return once more as companion to the wealth-bearing earth!
For the faithful beings of the Land of Snows in particular:
Do not neglect us, but through your aspirations and commitments,
Return swiftly with all the marks and signs as our lord and protector,
Indistinguishable in life and liberation from all the victorious ones!

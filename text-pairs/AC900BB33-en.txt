Prayer to the Chain of Rebirths
In the past, in the noble land of India, you were the arhat Sagilha,
In Padmasambhava’s presence, you were the lord Dorje Dudjom,
As the head of the Sakya, you were the glorious Kunga Gyaltsen, 1
At Geden Ling, you were the noble Gelek Palzang, 2
And in Minyak, you were Kunzang Chödrak— 3
Taking the form of such learned and accomplished masters,
You spread the Buddha’s teachings—to you I pray!
Now, you have been cared for by many teachers,
And applied the key points of study, reflection and meditation.
The blessings of Mipham Gyatso have entered your heart,
And you bring benefit to countless beings—to you I pray!
In future, you will manifest as Karmavajra,
The supreme commander to Kalkin Raudra Cakrin, 4 and so on,
In this way, you will continue to work for beings for as long as space exists,
To you, my only refuge, noble guru, I pray!
Having reached the limit of one’s own benefit through study, reflection and meditation,
One acts for others’ sake, through explanation, debate and composition is extensive,
Having set out upon the path of twofold benefit through study, practice and activity,
May I attain enlightenment inseparably from you, the supreme guide!

I take refuge in the Three Jewels.
I confess each and every one of my misdeeds.
I rejoice in the virtues of beings.
I keep the buddhas and bodhisattvas in mind.
In the Buddha, the Dharma and the Supreme Assembly,
I take refuge until I attain awakening.
To accomplish my own and others’ aims,
I generate the mind of awakening.
Having generated this supreme mind of bodhicitta,
I shall treat all sentient beings as my guests,
And undertake the sublime bodhisattva conduct.
May I attain buddhahood in order to benefit beings.

Offering to the Dharma Guardians of the 'Neck-Pouch Dagger’ (Purba Gulkhukma) Cycle
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ | oṃ āḥ hūṃ.
This torma is colourful and has a nourishing scent and flavour,
It is a samaya substance for generating immaculate wisdom.
When, in the presence of the all-knowing lord of the victorious ones, 1
This powerful and most profound maṇḍala
Of the Neck-Pouch Arisen Vajrakīla was first opened,
You vowed to carry out all the activities
Of guarding these teachings and sustaining those who uphold them:
Dorje Drakden, together with your retinue, I offer this to you!
Let your forceful pledge merge with the dharmadhātu
And cause all that we wish for
To ripen unimpededly, here and now!

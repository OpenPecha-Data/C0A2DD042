General Long-Life Prayer
oṃ amaraṇi jīvantaye svāhā
Vajra kāya of indestructible great bliss, union of appearance and emptiness,
Fully blossomed youthful form with all the marks and signs,
Wonderful embodiment, the nirmāṇakāya who tames everyone,
We pray: may the life of the unchanging vajra kāya be firm!
Vajra speech, the unceasing union of sound and emptiness,
The sixty aspects of the melodious sound of the profound and secret Dharma,
The sambhogakāya who teaches beings according to their needs,
We pray: may the unceasing vajra speech remain ever firm!
Vajra mind, the union of rigpa and emptiness, without birth, ceasing, or abiding,
The profound clear wisdom expanse from which all phenomena arise,
The all-pervasive lord dharmakāya, the essence of all the victors,
We pray: may the undeluded vajra mind remain ever firm!
You are the sun of activity in the all-encompassing sky,
Beyond rising and setting, the light of benefit and happiness,
Supreme nourishing water which causes the lotus petals of the teachings and beings to bloom,
May your presence be clearly manifest for an ocean of aeons!

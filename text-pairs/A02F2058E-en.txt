A Sādhana of Jambhala
In a single instant, I am the glorious Jambhala,
The colour of gold, beautiful in silk and jewel ornaments.
My right hand holds a bījapūraka fruit, 1
And my left a mongoose of jewel treasure.
I am in half-lotus posture on a lotus and moon.
At my heart upon a moon-disc is a syllable Dzaṁ surrounded by the mantra.
namo ratna trayāya | namo maṇi bhadraya | mahāyakṣa senāpataye | oṃ dzaṁbhala dzalenḍrāye svāhā

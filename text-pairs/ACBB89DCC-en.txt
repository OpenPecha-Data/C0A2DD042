Prayer to Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa Invoking His Previous Incarnations
Protector, lord presiding over the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, Samantabhadra
Whose very essence is the “ground continuum,” the sugatagarbha ;
Avalokiteśvara, the manifestation of emptiness and compassion;
And Garab Dorje—to you we pray!
You manifested as the son of King Kṛkin in the presence of Buddha Kāśyapa, 1
As Nanda, the younger brother of the Kinsman of the Sun, 2
As Akaramati emanated by King Songtsen Gampo, 3
And as King Trisong Detsen—to you we pray!
Mahāsiddha Virūpa and Princess Pemasal,
Vihāradhāra 4 in person, venerable Gyalse Lharje, 5
Drime Künden, 6 Yarje Orgyen Lingpa, 7
Dawö Shyönnu 8 and Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen, 9 to you we pray!
Samyépa, the actual manifestation of Mahāpaṇḍita Vimalamitra, 10
Ngari Paṇchen, 11 Chögyal Püntsok, 12
Tashi Tobgyal, 13 Dzamling Dorje, 14
And Jigme Lingpa, to you we pray!
Later, manifesting as Yeshe Dorje,
You will uphold the tradition of the Vajra-Essence teachings,
And, once again display for abusers and calumniators
All manners of manifestations—to you we pray!
In brief, you generated bodhicitta in front of Buddha Kāśyapa,
Then perfected the supreme training in the bodhisattvas’ conduct.
When you finally attain buddhahood as ‘Completely Victorious’,
May we be reborn among your foremost students!
May we see whatever you do with faith and devotion,
And repeatedly bringing your visage to mind,
May we never be separated from the supreme lama,
And attain complete enlightenment in one maṇḍala!

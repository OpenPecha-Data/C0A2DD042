A Prayer to Goddess Parṇaśavarī
Namo piśācyai!
Mother of the buddhas of the three times,
Great mother Prajñāpāramitā,
Appearing in a body of form as a protector of beings,
Parṇaśavarī, to you I offer homage and praise!
Despite having attained Buddhahood countless eons ago,
You appear as a female bodhisattva of the eighth bhūmi.
Accomplisher of the enlightened activities of the buddhas,
Goddess of golden form, to you I offer homage and praise!
In delightful wilderness of India,
You garbed yourself in a cloak of fresh leaves,
And performed the practice of Ārya Ajita. 1
Accomplisher of vidyā-mantra, to you I offer homage!
You pacify all forms of malevolence,
And bestow auspiciousness, happiness and peace.
Goddess known as Parṇaśavarī,
To you I offer homage and praise!
We—master, disciples and retinue—
Take refuge in you, O Goddess.
May you always protect us
From all epidemics and disease among humans and livestock!

The Melodic Sound of the Conch 1 A Prayer for the Long Life of the Vajra Master Dongna Choktrul Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti.
Through the blessings of the Three Jewels and Three Roots,
And blessings and truth of the gurus and long-life deities in particular,
You gained the courage to uphold the Victor’s teachings in their entirety,
Master of the learned and accomplished, to you I pray.
The blessings of the Mañjughoṣa guru dwell within your heart,
And your wisdom of learning and realization shines like the sun,
You who skilfully share a feast of great secret Dharma,
Fearless lion of speech, to you I pray. 3
May your life remain secure for an ocean of aeons.
Supreme source of refuge for the teachings and beings,
May your three secrets remain within the indestructible vajra element,
And your activity spread unimpededly throughout the world.
May the assembly of your devoted students continue to increase,
And your life remain secure as you spread the Buddhist teachings in every direction.
May all the ills of this evil age of degeneration be pacified,
And all be auspicious, so that we may savour the splendour of happiness and wellbeing.

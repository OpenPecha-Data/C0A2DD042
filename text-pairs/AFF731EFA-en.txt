Sukhāvatī Aspiration
Guide of Limitless Light—Amitābha—turn your enlightened attention towards me!
Just as you, a victorious one, generated the mind of bodhicitta,
I too now set my mind on unsurpassable, supreme awakening,
And whatever sources of virtue I have created, I dedicate
So that I may be reborn in your presence, supreme victorious one,
Within the western pure land of Sukhāvatī,
There to perfect entirely all the beneficial activity
Of an heir to the victorious ones.
As soon as I depart from this life,
May I miraculously take birth in that pure realm of Sukhāvatī,
And having received a prophecy from the Guide of Limitless Light,
May I bring perfecting, maturing and purifying to completion!
Amitābha, Buddha of Limitless Light, to you I pray!
Having set my mind on the attainment of supreme awakening,
As I dedicate all my sources of virtue towards rebirth in that supreme land of great bliss,
Grant your blessings so that this aspiration may be fulfilled!

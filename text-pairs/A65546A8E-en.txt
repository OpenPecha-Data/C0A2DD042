Recollecting the Deeds of The Tenth Days
Emaho: O wonder! Guru Padma, in you all buddhas are embodied,
To you I bow in devotion, remembering your deeds on the tenth days:
On the Dhanakośa lake, you were born in the heart of a lotus blossom,
As crown prince of Oḍḍiyāna, you ruled the kingdom,
Relinquishing the kingdom, you practised yogic discipline in the charnel grounds,
Ordained into the teaching, you mastered all objects of knowledge of both sūtras and tantras,
You established the Dharma in the kingdom of Zahor, taking the princess Mandāravā as your consort,
You set the land of Oḍḍiyāna on the path to enlightenment,
Destroying the tīrthikas, you raised the victory banner of the teachings,
When non-Buddhists harmed you, you subdued them with the greatness of your miracles,
Transforming deadly poison into medicine, you brought the tīrthikas into the Dharma,
Overcoming obstructive spirits in Nepal, you attained the siddhis of Yangdak and Vajrakīla,
Subjugating the earth of Tibet, you lit the lamp of the sacred Dharma,
In the centre and on the borders of Tibet you concealed countless termas.
“On the tenth day of each of the twelve months of the year
I have displayed one of my twelve great deeds; have faith in them,
And I will grant you the twelve siddhis.” As this was your promise,
Guru Rinpoche, to you I pray:
Pacify all obstacles, accomplish whatever we wish, just as our minds desire,
Make all good things, both spiritual and worldly, increase more and more,
Let us attain all the siddhis, ordinary and supreme,
And awaken into buddhahood, inseparable, O Guru, from you!

Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
You are Avalokiteśvara, the magical manifestation of compassion,
Supreme refuge and protector for all the beings of the Land of Snows,
Tenzin Gyatso, a master of wisdom, love and spiritual power:
We pray that your life-force never wavers and you remain long into the future!
Through the power and truth of the unfailing Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha,
May your enlightened activity extend everywhere in all the ten directions!
May all your wishes be swiftly and unobstructedly fulfilled!
And may you gain the glory of perfect mastery over the three domains!

To Fulfil All Wishes
Unfailing heart-essence of refuge, Padmākara,
When we pray to you, day and night, at the six times,
With the intense and overwhelming yearning of our devotion,
Let us never be overpowered by obstacles, and evil circumstances,
Guard us with your compassion always, never leave us,
And bless us so all our wishes be fulfilled, just as our minds desire!

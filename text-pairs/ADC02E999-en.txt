In Praise of the Goddess Mārīcī
Oṃ! Homage to the goddess Mārīcī!
Homage to her, the great enemy of the māras!
Utterly invincible, vanquisher of all,
She who travels before the sun and moon,
And drives away Makaradhvaja, God of Desire—
Simply by praying to you,
May the hosts of opposing forces be destroyed!
Slay them, divide them, drive them away, confuse them and disperse them,
And grant us the siddhi of total victory over all adversity!

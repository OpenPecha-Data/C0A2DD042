The Sweet Song of Gathering Auspiciousness A Prayer for Long Life and Name Offering for the Gentle Lord, Dharma Friend and Supreme Tulku Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ.
Fearless turner of the dharma wheel of the supreme vehicle,
By emitting myriad rays of the light of knowledge and love,
You banish darkness for the teachings and beings in this degenerate age—
Mañjughoṣa guru, I pray that you may live a hundred aeons.
Atop the victory banner of self-arisen Padma’s teachings
Is the precious jewel crest of spontaneous luminosity,
Adorned with the brocade of the teaching and practice of sūtra and mantra—
I pray that you may remain as a great bringer of universal victory.
Within the great primordially pure expanse of the supreme, immutable wisdom mind,
There is neither union with nor separation from the vajra essence of the three kāyas.
I pray that you may remain forever deathless and sublime
Upon the throne of effortless, spontaneous perfection.
In the vast ocean of the wisdom play of twofold knowledge,
The excellent terrace of the four kāyas, delightful to behold,
Rises as a vajra peak surmounting existence and quiescence.
May the great strength of your enlightened activity intensify.
May this prayer be fulfilled just so, and through the power
And truth of the infinite Three Roots in all their compassion,
May the glorious guru’s life long remain secure,
And may he be entirely inseparable from the Lotus King.

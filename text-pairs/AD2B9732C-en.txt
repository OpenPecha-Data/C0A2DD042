Prayer to Shechen Kongtrul as Vajrasattva
You are Vajrasattva, lord of a hundred buddha families, in person,
Whose name alone guards against the terrors of the lower realms.
Pema Drimé Lekpé Lodrö, from the depth of my heart, I pray to you:
Grant me empowerments and blessings!
oṃ mahāguru padma vimala mati śrī vajrasatva kāya vāk citta abhiṣiñca sarva siddhi phala āḥ hūṃ
May all impairments of samayas of body, speech and mind,
Brought about through bewilderment, ignorance and delusion,
Be purified in emptiness that is beyond the duality of arising and ceasing
And may I see awareness and emptiness, the true face of Vajrasattva!

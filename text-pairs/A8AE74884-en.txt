Praise and Prayer to the Five Families of Mañjuśrī
oṃ vākyedaṃ namaḥ
Great body of all the buddhas,
Wisdom body, sovereign body,
Mañjuśrī, immaculate in form,
Vajra granter of boons, to you I offer homage and praise.
oṃ vāgiśvara muṃ
Striking fear into deer-like heretics
With the lion’s roar of selflessness. 1
You reveal the universal meaning,
Master of speech, to you I offer homage and praise.
oṃ arapacana dhīḥ
A light for beings, a lantern unto wisdom,
With energy supreme, most radiant, 2
Entirely free from any form of concept. 3
Mañjuvajra, to you I offer homage and praise.
oṃ vajratīkṣṇa duḥkha chheda prajñā jñāna mūrtaye | jñāna-kāya-vāgiśvara arapacanāyate namaḥ
His thinking free from doubt, his object threefold,
His object all, three properties by nature. 4
The buddha’s unsurpassed awakening, 5
Limitless Qualities, to you I offer homage and praise.
oṃ hrīḥ mame dīpaṃ mañjuśrī mūṃ hrīḥ prajñā vardhani hrīḥ dhīḥ svāhā
The unassailable, the lion of speech, 6
With universal vision, true delight,
With fire garlands, handsome to behold, 7
Dharma Banner of Victory, to you I offer homage and praise.
oṃ mañjuśrī-jñāna-satva-hūṃ
Primordial buddha, who’s devoid of any cause,
With wisdom as his only eye, unstained,
Tathāgata, with wisdom as his body, 8
Lord of the maṇḍala, to you I offer homage and praise.
Through the merit of paying homage and praising
The hosts of deities of the five families of Mañjuśrī,
May the darkness of ignorance be entirely dispelled
And the light of twofold knowledge always shine.

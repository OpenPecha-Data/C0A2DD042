The Sun of Samantabhadra’s Realm The Quintessence of Oceanic Prayers of Aspiration
Your enlightened body was formed through the splendour of twofold accumulation beyond measure;
Your enlightened speech, the melody of Brahmā, has sixty aspects;
And your enlightened mind is perfectly replete with the qualities of the ten powers—
Mighty Sage, supreme deity of deities, turn your attention towards me, I pray.
Just as you embraced with intense care and compassion
The multitudes tormented by the three types of suffering, 1
And set your mind on supreme and unsurpassed awakening,
In order to fulfil the twin aims and wishes of yourself and others,
May I too remain untempted by the allure of selfish peace and bliss,
And, until all beings, who are as innumerable as space is vast, are freed,
Rely on the adornment of altruistic concern and beneficial conduct.
In all my lives, as I willingly enter the citadel of conditioned existence,
May I be cared for and joyfully accepted by the sole father of all,
That veritable treasury of wisdom, heroic Mañjuśrī,
And may I perfect the oceanic conduct of the bodhisattvas,
As revealed in Samantabhadra's prayer of aspiration.
In future, when nine hundred and ninety-six great guides
Display the attainment of awakening in this very realm,
May I serve them constantly as the best of their attendants,
And gain the power to contribute to their magnificent activity.
May all beings with whom I am connected, through actions good or bad,
Take birth, as soon as they depart this life, in the realm of Great Bliss,
There to receive prophecy from Ablaze with Myriad Tokens of Light 2
And fulfil their enormous potential for knowledge, love and strength.
May the faultless teachings of Buddha flourish and endure,
And all beings without exception enjoy the splendour of benefit and happiness.
This, and only this, is my constant aspiration—
Assure me, here and now, that it all will be fulfilled.
May auspiciousness ripen as a treasure of fourfold abundance, 3
Healing nourishment for all living beings without exception.
And may ills and misfortune be forever entirely unknown,
As the light of virtue and excellence fills the three domains.

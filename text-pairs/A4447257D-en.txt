Heart of Vajrasattva—The Heart of Confession, the King of Purification Practices
Oṃ! Primordial Buddha Samantabhadra, the ground of being:
O Vajrasattva, Vajra Tathāgata,
Great hero, lord and protector of beings:
Turn your love towards us; gaze on us with eyes of wisdom!
Āḥ! All is from the beginning unborn and primordially pure,
Yet conceptual thoughts, arising momentarily in our deluded minds,
Cause ignorance, dualistic perception, impairments and breakages,
Which we confess now in the expanse of the dharmadhātu mother, utter purity!
Vajra! Lord of Secrets, Vajrapāṇi, who declared the vajra decree,
Of all the hundred thousand secret samayas
Of body, speech and mind; whichever vows we have impaired or pledges we have broken
With deepest remorse and regret, we acknowledge and confess them!
Sattva! Now that the time has elapsed for impairments to become faults,
And causes for the harsh retribution commanded by
The vajra ḍākinīs, whose stern task it is,
I confess having obscured this life and the next, by accumulating the causes of the great hells!
Hūṃ! ‘King of Passion’, the great primordial Vajra,
Free from any conceptual reference, beyond all impairment or confession,
Is Samantabhadra, always perfect, the vast expanse of rigpa,
Ever present as the space of dharmadhātu: Āḥ

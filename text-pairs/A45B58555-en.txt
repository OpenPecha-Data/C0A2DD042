Aspiration Prayer 1
Glorious embodiment of all the buddhas,
Padmākara, treasury of compassion,
Remain forever in the lake of my mind.
Let my mind and your wisdom merge as one.
May all those under the sway of ignorance and the kleśas,
And are thus tormented by the three kinds of suffering,
All the sentient beings of the six classes within saṃsāra,
Be freed through your compassion, O precious guru!
May I never fall prey at any time
To inappropriate modes of thought
And thereby stray onto non-dharmic paths,
But let renunciation alone suffuse my being.
May I emulate the buddhas
Of the past, present and future,
And through the infinite activity of a bodhisattva,
Become a source of splendour for all beings.

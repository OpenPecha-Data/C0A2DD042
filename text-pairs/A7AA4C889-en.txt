The Concise Feast Offering
oṃ āḥ hūṃ hoḥ
Gurus, devas, ḍākinīs all: come now to this gaṇacakra feast.
Outer, inner and secret great bliss are the gaṇacakra offerings I make.
All impairments and breakages of samaya, I confess.
Duality, enemies and obstructors: liberate them into the dharmadhātu.
May your wisdom mind, the great bliss of equality, be delighted;
Please grant me attainments, ordinary and supreme.

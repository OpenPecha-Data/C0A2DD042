Prayer to Lord Marpa, Consort and Heirs 1
Emaho!
You who assumed the form of a wondrous mahāsiddha,
Sublime dharma -king, master of mind and perception,
Magnificent translator, Lord Marpa Lotsāwa,
Sovereign of vast intelligence and supreme mind, 2
Keeper of the secret treasury of oceanic tantras,
Great universal ruler, who attained the state of union.
Your son, whom you blessed with your three secrets,
Was the bodhisattva and magnificent tamer of beings
Darma Dodé, whose wondrous form arose from twofold accumulation.
A manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, embodiment of oceanic wisdom,
Appearing in youthful form as a master of infinite aspiration.
Vajra Nairātmyā appearing in human female guise,
Was the wisdom goddess and embodiment of bliss,
In whose bhaga of absolute space all the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are contained—
She who emanates and attracts all the victorious ones of the three times.
Foremost among all the adepts of Cakrasaṃvara,
Was the master for whom all movement within the lalanā and rasanā 3
Was eclipsed, consumed within the space of Rahū,
And who reached the culmination of the sixteen joys, the state of no-more-learning,
He whose name alone guards against saṃsāra’s terror,
The master who directly confers the greatest of blessings,
The one renowned as Dorje Gyaltsen and Töpa Ga,
Ornament of all three worlds, supreme among human beings.
Through this, my devoted prayer to the reverend and noble Guru,
Together with his consort and heirs, inspire me with your blessings.
Let the great sun of co-emergent wisdom dawn within my mind
To banish all the darkness contained within an ignorant heart.
May the city of the three worlds’ hostile forces be forever undone,
And may we savour the treasury of inexhaustible kāyas and wisdoms
Within the delightful, spontaneously present palace of Akaniṣṭha,
And empty the three realms of saṃsāra from their very depths.

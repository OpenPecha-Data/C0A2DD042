Prayer for the Long Life of Tulku Thondup Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
By the power of the truth of the Three Jewels, deities and sages,
May the lotus feet of Ngawang Lobzang Döndrup, ‘Lord of Speech, the Noble-Minded One who Accomplishes All Aims’,
Remain forever secure upon the vajra throne,
And the light of his beneficial and joyful activity mature the minds of disciples.

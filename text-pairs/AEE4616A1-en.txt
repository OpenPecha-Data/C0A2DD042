Prayer to Gyaltsen Tsemö Pung Gyen 1
Oṃ! We take refuge in the gurus, the yidams, and in you, Gyaltsen Tsemö Pung Gyen,
Along with all your retinue!
By the power of this fervent prayer of ours,
Quickly protect us from all failure and misfortune!
Oṃ hūṃ svāhā!
O Pung Gyen, and your retinue:
With the force of your magical display, for us, our benefactors, and all those around us
Avert all bad dreams, and those who have ill thoughts or do us harm!
Avert spells and curses, dispute and conflict!
Avert all weakening in our life force, body, wangtang and windhorse!
Avert all illness in men and women, all loss of our resources!
Grant us long life, merit, glory and renown, and
Make peace and happiness reign, throughout both day and night!

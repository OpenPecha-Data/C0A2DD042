If your wisdom-being is invoked with unshakable devotion,
Then at sunrise on the excellent tenth day you will come!
This is your vajra-speech and your promise!
In your excellence, don’t delay—bestow now upon me
The result, the unfailing truth, Nirmāṇakāya of Uḍḍiyāna.
This is my prayer—fulfil my hopes and grant my wishes.
Padmākara, please grant me the fruits!
My heart is filled with longing, and yearning devotion,
And my speech is all suffused with clear melodious prayer,
As you approach, Padmākara, from the Copper-Coloured Mountain,
Surrounded by hosts of ḍākas and ḍākinīs.
Your body—vivid, clear—appears before my eyes;
Your melodious dharma speech is pleasant to my ears;
Your mind’s soothing blessings enter my heart.
Please bestow your great resplendence and grant the four empowerments!
Agitated gods and demons from the past
Cause diseases, calamities, poverty and destitution
for men and beasts alike.
In these times of warfare, with enemies all around, Grant your blessings, so that all may be pacified, all disaster averted!
Bring timely rain! Let crops and livestock thrive!
Grant long life, without disease; set body, speech and mind at ease!
Open the gates of fortune in all directions!
Bless this golden age, that it may grow, in endless joy!
Your pledge to the king, to the prince and subjects—
That you never would abandon the people of Tibet—
This is the fruit of your unchanging vajra-speech.
Let us celebrate this feast of your promise coming true!
From this day forth until my effortless attainment Of everlasting excellence, Samantabhadra,
For as long as this takes, my sole protector,
Care for me, I pray, and keep me sated
With the elixir of the amṛta of supreme and common siddhis.

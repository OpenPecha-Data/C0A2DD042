Windhorse Practice of Tārā
Oṃ. Queen of space, savior of all beings,
Perfectly pure essence of wind that pervades all,
You give birth to all worlds and cause them to flourish.
Noble Lady Tārā, I pay homage to you!
Lady whose face gleams as white as the autumn moon,
By pacifying all adversity and affliction,
And spontaneously bringing favorable conditions and fulfiling wishes,
Generate the windhorse of dissolving the eight dangers into space!
Lady who shines as brightly as the golden sun,
By eliminating all decadence and poverty,
And increasing lifespan, merit, wealth and renown,
Generate the windhorse of expanding prosperity and fortune!
Lady who blazes with the luster of red rubies,
By dispelling all dependency and misfortune,
And bringing the whole apparent world under my control,
Generate the windhorse of magnetizing the triple world!
Lady who sparkles with blue sapphire brilliance,
By repelling all enemies, obstacles and harm,
And granting total victory over all danger and adversity,
Generate the windhorse of overpowering demonic hordes!
Lady who beams with emerald green light,
By pacifying all unwanted circumstances,
And accomplishing all aims with auspicious glory,
Generate the windhorse of acting on a space-like scale!

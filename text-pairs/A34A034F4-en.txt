The Vajra Words That Radiate Cloud-Masses of Nectar-Like Blessings An Aspiration Prayer Composed by the Master MahƒÅsiddha Thangtong Gyalpo in the Presence of the Jowo Rinpoche in Lhasa
First, you generated the supreme mind of unsurpassable awakening
Firmly set upon the liberation of sentient beings in their infinitude,
Then, you perfected the two accumulations, O compassionate Victorious One,
You whose love embraces beings bereft of any protector in these degenerate times:
Protect them without fail!
For these beings plagued by hunger, thirst, difficulties, and suffering,
Release upon the world and the Land of Snows
A rain of all the pleasant things the senses can enjoy,
Including jewels, food, wealth, grain, and bedding!
Pacify harm among the four elements,
Untimely wind and fire, or inauspicious rains and waters!
Let grains, plants, harvests and the like
Mature fully, just as in the golden age!
Through the strength of aspirations such as these,
Inspired by loving-kindness and compassion,
May sicknesses, weapons, and famines be thoroughly pacified
And beings enjoy long life, good health, well-being and happiness!
Through the power of the compassion of the victorious ones and their heirs,
And the infallible power of the interdependence of causes and results,
May the teachings of the Victorious One spread and flourish,
And all beings swiftly reach unsurpassable awakening!

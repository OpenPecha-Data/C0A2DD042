Prayer for the Long Life of Gyaltön Choktrul Incorporating His Series of Rebirths
Oṃ svasti.
To the victorious Lake-born Vajra and consort,
Twenty-five disciples, siddhas and vidyādharas,
I pray: shower down a great rain of blessings
And grant us attainments, ordinary and supreme.
Mañjuśrīmitra, accomplished paṇḍita of the Noble Land,
Grant pioneer in the transmission of Yamāntaka teachings,
Sangye Yeshe, who was born into the clan of Nub,
And noble Tsöndrü Sengé, to you I pray.
Saltong Shagom, 1 who was Dakpo’s heart-son,
Namkha Rinchen, a master of learning and accomplishment,
Lord Batsam Pema, who perfected experience and realization,
And Sonam Lhagyal, to you I pray.
You were cared for and guided by many sublime teachers,
Possess bodhicitta, gained signs of realization in approach and accomplishment,
And now, through your enlightened actions, bring benefit and happiness to the teachings and beings—
Orgyen Jigme Wangpo, 2 to you I pray.
Through the power of the truth of praying in this way,
May the glorious guru’s life long remain secure,
May all his noble aspirations be fulfilled,
And may all be auspicious for the perfection of twofold benefit. 3

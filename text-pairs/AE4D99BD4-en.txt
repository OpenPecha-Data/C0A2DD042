A Prayer to Tārā
Śvaṃ a.
In the heart of the myriad pure realms of my pure illusory body
Lies the Array of Turquoise Petals.
Here my awareness, embodiment of the three kāyas, appears as the Noble Lady Tārā
And the collections of consciousness the Twenty-one Tārās.
Within the realization of our inseparability, I supplicate you!
Protect me from the eight fears that arise from dualistic fixation upon subject and object,
Grant the spontaneous fulfilment of wishes
And accomplishment of the ground of great convention.

Verses of Truth for Accomplishing Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of Kyabjé Gyaltsab Rinpoche
The empty essence of all phenomena is beyond transition or change,
Unobstructed, blazing with the splendour of the signs and marks—
Padma’s regent, holder of vajra-like awareness,
Mighty and victorious one, to you I pray.
Upon the stable foundation of the altruistic mind of awakening,
You raised the victory banner of Dharma, and, by courageously pursuing
The threefold training, grew rich with the treasures of the noble ones—
Greatly intelligent one, may you remain for a hundred aeons.
With your three vajra secrets beyond ageing and decline,
Your supreme mind perfect in the great strength of its wisdom awareness—
Spontaneous, eternal, stable, indestructible and everlasting—
May you remain upon the hidden throne for a hundred aeons.
With a form that is unchanging and stable as a mountain,
Speech that’s unceasing and rains Dharma in Brahma’s voice,
And a mind that has intense love for all beings,
Glorious guru, may you live for a hundred aeons!
Through securing a stable life for the glorious guru,
May all the ills plagues that I and others face be pacified,
May positivity increase just like the waxing crystal moon,
And the light of virtue and excellence fill the three worlds.

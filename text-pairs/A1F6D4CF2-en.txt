Petitionary Offering to Norbu Dradül Tsal
O single embodiment of the three families, manifestation of Padmasambhava’s compassion
And emanation of the activity of Tri Song Deutsen—
‘Foe-Subduing Jewel’ (Norbu Dradül Tsal),
Together with your retinue of offspring, consorts and ministers,
And the ranks of the warrior spirits and werma s, come now!
Accept these offerings of torma, golden drink and fragrant smoke.
Subdue spirits of madness, exterminate hostile enemies,
Terminate the wanderings of quarrelsome evil spirits,
And protect me, my companions and patrons, with your loving care.
Bring all our wishes and aspirations to fulfilment,
And carry out your activity of being victorious over all.

Verses of Auspiciousness
Oṃ svasti.
Buddhas of the ten directions, rare and sublime ones,
Gurus, yidam deities, and hosts of dharma protectors,
Wealth deities, treasure-keepers, guardians of the light,
I pray to you all: please let everything be auspicious.
Eight goddesses of good fortune,
And in particular Mārīcī,
Who precedes the sun and moon,
Let everything always be auspicious for us.
Śabarī, Tārā,
Bhṛkuṭī, Sitātapatrā,
Vijayā, Locanā and the rest—
All you goddesses, protect us.
Wherever we go, wherever we stay,
Save us from every form of danger,
Enhance our lifespan, health, and resources,
And fulfil our each and every wish.
Gurus, turn your wise attention towards us.
Yidam deities, provide us with succour and support.
Ḍākinīs, care for us as if we were your own children.
Dharma protectors and guardians, accompany and assist us.
Five Tashi Tseringma sisters,
Venerable Nyenchen Thanglha,
And great leonine king Gesar,
Provide assistance and protection.

In Praise of Patrul Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo
You traversed the ocean of knowledge of the outer and inner sciences
To become a repository of manifold teachings, profound and vast.
In solitary places, you devoted your entire life to practice,
Saw the yidam deities in visions and mastered twofold bodhicitta.
You realized the equal taste of the eight worldly concerns and practised as a hidden yogin;
You transformed a land of unwholesome action into a sanctuary of the virtuous;
You promoted the excellent path of bodhisattva conduct in a hundred directions;
And you maintained the life-force of the ultimate teachings of the great secret king of tantras.
While thus recalling your life of liberation,
I pray to you, Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo:
Hold me with compassion in this life, the next and the bardo state,
And inspire me to uphold the lineage of the great masters of the past.

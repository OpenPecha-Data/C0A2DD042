The Vase of Immortal Life The Long-Life Practice of the Vidyādharas, from the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse The Summoning of Long Life 6 Hūṃkara Mañjuśrīmitra Nāgārjuna Prabhāhasti Dhanasamskṛta Vimalamitra Rombuguhya Śāntigarbha Long-Life Empowerment
Hrīḥ!  I am Padmākara, the vidyādhara with power over life
Who has control over all appearance and existence.
At my heart is Lord Amitāyus, Buddha of Limitless Life,
Brilliant red, in saṃbhogakāya form, in union with his consort,
Holding a lotus vase made of ruby.
At his heart, within an amulet of sun and moon, stands
The vital heart essence, the syllable hrīḥ.
Around it stretches the mantra garland, from which
Rays of lights stream out and gather in
The vital force and energy of the inanimate and animate universe,
And the essence of longevity of all buddhas, vidyādharas, and sages, 4
Concentrating it all into one vital elixir. 5
Even the pores of my body are filled with Amitāyuses,
Every one of them reverberating sweetly, like swarming bees,
With the soft, low sound of hrīḥ:
I accomplish the state of vidyādhara of immortality.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra-mahā-guru ayur-jñāna-mahā-punye tsé bhrūṃ nṛ jaḥ sarva-siddhi hūṃ
Oṃ! My entire perception is the Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain,
Where the palace with five certainties appears of its own accord,
From there, Buddha Amitāyus, Lord of Limitless Life,
Along with your gathering of vidyādharas, all in the rainbow body,
I invoke you! Arise from within the expanse of space!
Gather the vital energy of deathless space,
And when the element consciousness flies away,
Enclose it in the expanse of awareness 8 that is Dhātvīśvarī.

Show me a sign in the length of this arrow of longevity;
Transform the sādhana substances into the nectar of immortality;
Grant me the attainment which is free from birth and death!

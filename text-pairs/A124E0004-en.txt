Essence and Embodiment of All the Buddhas 1
Essence and embodiment of all the buddhas of the past, present and future,
Lord whose presence pervades the oceanic maṇḍalas and buddha families, precious root guru of incomparable kindness, watch over me!
Let your blessings infuse my mind, I pray.
Bless me, I pray, that I may recognize my dreams as dreams.
Bless me, I pray, that I may be able to create emanations within dreams and transform them.
Bless me, I pray, that my dreams may arise as clear light.
Bless me, I pray, that I may continuously integrate luminosity!

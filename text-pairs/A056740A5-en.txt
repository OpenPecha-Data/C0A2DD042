Brief Prayer for Pacifying the Turmoil of the Mamos
All causes of turmoil among the mamos of appearance and existence,
Both mamos of the basic space of wisdom and those of this worldâ€”
All our impairments and breakages, errors and confusions, we confess.
We supplicate you. We make this offering to you. Let it satisfy and delight you.

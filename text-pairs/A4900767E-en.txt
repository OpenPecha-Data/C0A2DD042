An Aspirational Prayer to Behold the Beautiful Face of Khecharī
From the dance of bliss-emptiness of limitless conquerors,
Appearing as so many visual illusions of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa;
Henceforth, now, glorious Khecharī, Attractive One,
With my heartfelt recollection, protect with a joyful loving embrace.
In Akaniṣṭha is the innate Mother of the conquerors,
At the twenty-four places — the realm born ḍākinīs,
Pervasive wealth-holders — karmamudrās;
Holy One, be the Refuge Lord of me the yogi.
You are the manifestation of my own mind of emptiness,
The actual VAṂ in the E space of the vajra city;
As a frightful rakṣasī of the island of illusion and
A bright smiling youth — clearly revealed.
I, not having found anything determined to be
Truly established, although searching, however much;
The mind of that person wearied by elaborations,
Takes rest in the forest shelter free of expression.
Ema! Now Ḍākinī, arise from space; from the Śrī Heruka,
King of Tantras, protect by the truth of the saying;
Accomplishment is through reciting the excellent
Near-essence mantra of the Vajra Queen.
In a secluded forest of Oḍḍiyāna,
After protecting the lord of siddhas, Vajra Ghaṇṭapa;
With the bliss of an embrace and kiss,
[You] led to the realm of Khechara; likewise also protect me.
From an island in the Ganga, the holy Kushali
Was actually led to the expanse of space,
And after, glorious Nāropa was taken; likewise,
Lead me also to Khechara, the city of Joyful Ones.
Through the compassion of the root and lineage [gurus] and the
Superior swift path of the profound, ultimate secret, great Tantra;
With the power of a pure unusual attitude, may I the yogi,
Quickly see the smiling face of the Joyful One, Khecharī.

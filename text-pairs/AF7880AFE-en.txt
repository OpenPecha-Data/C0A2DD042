Prayer for the Long Life of Dezhung Rinpoche 1
Oṃ svasti.
Through your threefold training, which delights all beings including the devas,
O sun of speech, you cause the utpala garden of the teachings
Of Tsechen [Kunga] Nyingpo to flourish—may your life remain secure
And may your activity based on learning and realization spread far and wide.

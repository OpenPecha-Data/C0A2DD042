A Short Prayer Based on the Life and Liberation of the All-Knowing, All-Seeing Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
Namo guru mañjughoṣāya!
Crown adornment of all the holders of the teachings in the Land of Snows,
All-seeing Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo,
You were born into the Nyö family in Terlhung in Derge.
You followed 1 a hundred and fifty authentic teachers,
And received more than seven hundred volumes of the Sarma and Nyingma teachings.
Without sectarian bias, you revitalised the teachings of all schools
And maintained the vital points of each individual tradition,
So that numerous eminent masters appeared—such is your kindness, sublime one.
Who else has been such a protector? Of such service to the stream of teachings?
Your activity has permeated the entire world.
In particular, you sedulously received the whispered transmissions passed down without interruption
From the lord of siddhas Thangtong Gyalpo himself,
And applied them perfectly in practice.
You held the Whispered Transmission of Secret Conduct to be
More effective than other instructions; you nurtured fortunate disciples
And became a master of these Whispered Transmission teachings.
The fivefold cycle of essential sādhanas, 2
The Essence of the Mahāsiddha's Wisdom Mind, 3 Kagyé, Mahākāla and  the rest—
Indivisible from the master in his wisdom form,
You received the patrimonial blessings of these mind-direct transmission as they were transferred into your wisdom mind.
The tenfold lineage of exposition, the eight chariots of the practice lineage,
The seven major transmissions and especially
The five and eight transmissions of Thangtong Gyalpo—
Supreme teacher of them all, Ösal Trulpé Dorje, to you I bow.
With vast wisdom you saw the crucial points of all the teachings,
With vast love you brought countless disciples to maturity,
With vast power you drove away malevolent barbarians—
Great scholar and adept, inspire me with your blessings!

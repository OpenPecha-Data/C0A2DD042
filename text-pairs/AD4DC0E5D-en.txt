The Concentrated Essence A Sādhana of Yeshe Tsogyal
In the guru and the wisdom ḍākinī I take refuge;
And for beings’ sake, I generate bodhicitta.
Perfect in the moment of recollection,
I am Vajrayoginī in the form of Yeshe Tsogyal.
From the mantra garland at my heart’s vital core,
Rays of light emanate and return, bringing twofold benefit.
Appearances and sound are deity and mantra in the state of dharmatā,
And everything coalesces within a single sphere of perfect bliss.
oṃ jñāna ḍākinī baṃ harinisa siddhi hūṃ
Generated appearances are awakened into emptiness,
And emptiness’s own inherent energy arises as the deity.
Any merit gained through these exertions, I dedicate to beings.
May all be auspicious so that twofold benefit is spontaneously accomplished!

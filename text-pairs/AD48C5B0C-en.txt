Bestower of Supreme Twofold Attainment A Prayer to the Great and Glorious Fifteenth Karmapa
Namo guru!
Master of the activity of all the victorious ones and their heirs,
Single embodiment of threefold knowledge, love and power,
Great holder of the deep blue crown of Akṣobhya,
Glorious Karmapa, to you I pray.
Secret treasury of all the tathāgatas,
Whose character is the pervasive vajra of space,
Perfectly awakened buddha in human form,
Rangjung Takpé Dorje, to you I pray.
With command of a vast ocean of wisdom,
Through oceanic activity, until saṃsāra is empty,
You fully ripen an ocean of sentient beings,
Lhenkyé Dewé Dorje, to you I pray.
Whoever prays to you receives blessings there and then.
Your compassion is unobstructed, like lightning in the sky.
You are inseparable from the protector Avalokiteśvara,
All-pervasive sovereign, Karmapa, to you I pray.
Upon the field of my devoted body, speech and mind,
Shower down the rain of the glorious guru’s blessings.
Upon the burgeoning shoots of my awakening mind,
Let ripen the excellent fruit of the guru’s four kāyas.
In all my lives, may the glorious Karmapa,
His feet gracing an immaculate white lotus,
Adorn the chakra, Brahma’s abode, at my crown,
And grant empowerment through the transference of wisdom realization.
Through the power of bringing to mind your three secrets, 1
May I gain the splendour of a ripened and liberated mind,
And, through emulating activity that is as infinite as space,
Auspiciously bring vast benefit to the teachings and beings.

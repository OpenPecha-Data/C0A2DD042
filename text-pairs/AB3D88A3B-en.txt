A Song of Prayer to Jamyang Loter Wangpo
In the unborn space of dharmadhātu
Light rays of compassion are unceasing.
A new sun that banishes the darkness of unknowing,
O gracious guru, care for me!
In the perception of beings in this age of fivefold degeneration,
You appeared with ordinary, tainted aggregates.
But you are a yogi for whom delusion has ended,
O gracious guru, care for me!
To childish beings of limited capacity
You appear in a mundane human form,
Yet your realization matches that of a buddha—
O gracious guru, care for me!
You are a leader pure in ethical discipline
With the vision of the noble Dharma of the three vehicles,
A guide revealing the way to liberation—
O gracious guru, care for me!
Teacher for whom past aspirations have matured,
Supreme guide for fortunate disciples,
Sovereign of the great secret classes of tantra—
O gracious guru, care for me!
You are the master of all the noble Dharma teachings
Of the New and Old traditions, of kama and of terma,
A representative of the mighty Vajradhara—
O gracious guru, care for me!
Like an excellent vase that bestows ripening empowerments,
A leader whose pith instructions bring about liberation,
Life-pillar of the flawless teachings of the victorious ones,
Loter Wangpo, ‘Lord of the Treasury of Intelligence’, care for me!
Like a picture of well-performed meritorious deeds,
Drawn with aspirations that accord with reality,
Your face, like the heart of a lotus flower,
Appeared as ambrosia for the eyes.
As the eastern orb of clear light
Shines on the lotus grove of the teachings,
May the light of unceasing enlightened activity
Bring virtue and goodness to the three worlds!
In the vast expanse of wisdom realization,
May the cluster of indestructible five-coloured light,
Arise as the vajra body beyond transference,
Complete with the seven vajra qualities!

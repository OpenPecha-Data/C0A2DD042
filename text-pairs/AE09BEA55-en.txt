The Vajra Verses: A Prayer of the Fierce Inner Heat
Emaho!
In the city of the infinite purity of the central channel
Is the vajra mind, the essence of the dharmakāya.
The aggregates, elements, and sense-fields are the deities of the three seats.
I supplicate their manifestations— the root and lineage gurus.
May Caṇḍalī, the melting bliss of inseparable energy and mind,
Bring delight to the cities of the ḍākinīs and heroes in the five chakras
Through the gatherings of the tantric feast,
And may I be suffused with the experiences of the empowerments and the primordial wisdom of the four joys.
In particular, may the supreme fierce inner heat
Make pliable the energy and mind within the four chakras, and as the knots of the central channel
Are released as the paths of accumulation, unification, seeing, and meditation,
May energy and mind ripen at the crown protuberance, the conclusion of the ten stages.
With the afflictions, energy, and mind— the nature of cyclic existence,
Brought under control through the supreme, utterly free and peaceful primordial wisdom energy,
May the channels and elements be spontaneously perfected
On the stage of the Great Cloud Mass of Rotating Syllables. 1

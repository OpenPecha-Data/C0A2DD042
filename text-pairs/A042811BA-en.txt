Prayer to Behold Amitābha in Dreams
Emaho.
Wondrous dharmakāya Amitābha—'Limitless Light',
Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapāṇi-Mahāsthāmaprāpta,
I pray to you with single-pointed intention:
Inspire me with your blessings, so that I may travel in my dreams
To the Land of Great Bliss and there encounter Amitābha.

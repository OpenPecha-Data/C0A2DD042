Praise of Kunga Yeshe, Great Being and Master of Extensive Scriptural Traditions
Oṃ svasti!
Personification of all the infinite victorious buddhas,
Merely to see, hear, touch or remember you,
Brings a joyous celebration of benefit and happiness—
Embodiment of wisdom, to you I bow down!
Your speech reveals all that is knowable,
Unfolding as the splendour of total joy—
To you who possess the liberative speech
Of the wisdom being Mañjuśrī, I bow down!
You illumine the nature of all phenomena
Through the path of the four joys,
And, realising the union of bliss and emptiness,
Possess the five wisdoms—to you I bow down!
You bring delight to all the learned ones,
A treasury of oceanic qualities of scripture and realization,
All spontaneously perfect from the very beginning—
To you possess universal knowledge and awareness, I bow down!
Your excellent activity brings the joyousness
Of oceanic virtue and goodness for all beings,
And for as long as saṃsāra itself remains,
You will reveal your wisdom display—to you I bow down!

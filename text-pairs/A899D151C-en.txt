Sang Offering to Yellow Jambhala
Kye! In the great palace of oceanic yakṣas and wealth deities
Is Yellow Jambhala, keeper of the treasury of all that is desired.
Now, to expand the great clouds of jewel-like fortune and prosperity
And bring down a shower of all the riches we wish for and require,
Come here and joyfully take your place on seats of lotus and moon.
We present to you these clouds of offerings that bring delight:
Billows of smoke produced from the finest array of substances,
Choicest food and drinks such as tea, alcohol, milk and curd,
And many of the most wondrous items in existence—all this
We offer to you, Lord of Treasure, together with your retinue.
Pacify disharmony and adversity for us, teacher and disciples.
Eliminate turmoil and disease among people and livestock,
Let all countries and regions be filled with happiness and joy,
And bring the increased wealth and prosperity of a golden age.

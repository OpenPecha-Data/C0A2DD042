Prayer to Machik Labdrön
Ascertaining the natural state of threefold knowledge,
And practising the key points of the four applications,
One arrives perfectly at the ultimate fruition, dharmakāya—
Mother of the buddhas of the three times, to you I pray!
Profound basic space, dharmakāya mother beyond attachment,
Manifests perfectly as the wisdom mudrā of clear realization,
Whose display arises to disciples' perception in wrathful guise—
Exalted Krodhakālī, look upon me with compassion!
Playful dance of emanation bringing benefit to beings,
Who fulfilled the aspirations of the great paṇḍitas of India
And appeared to Tibetans in female human form—
Mother Labkyi Drönma, inspire me with your blessings!

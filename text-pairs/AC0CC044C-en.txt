Prayer for the Long Life of Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentsé Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti! 1
Dance of wisdom and love, sovereign of the entire Buddhist teaching—
The great Dharma-ocean of the transmission and realization of the profound and vast,
You have mastered through hearing, reflecting and meditating.
Supreme incarnation, may your aspirations be fulfilled, and may your life and activity be infinite.

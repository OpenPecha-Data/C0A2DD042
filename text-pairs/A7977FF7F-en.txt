Prayer to Tārā: A Sevenfold Supplication for Protection
I pray to celestial Tārā, the exalted mother,
Who abides within the uncreated dharmadhātu,
From where she bestows comfort and joy upon all:
Protect me from all fear.
I pray to the divine mother Tārā:
Through not realizing our innate nature to be dharmakāya,
Our minds remain under the influence of destructive emotion;
Protect all of us who wander aimlessly in saṃsāra.
I pray to the genuine deity, mother Tārā:
Protect us in whose hearts the genuine dharma hasn’t been born,
Who fixate on words and ideas,
Or who have been deceived by false claims.
I pray to the deity of mindfulness, mother Tārā:
Protect us who have glimpsed the nature of mind, so difficult to realize,
And yet, due to lack of mindfulness and familiarity,
Remain distracted by negative action.
I pray to the deity who is inseparable from my mind, mother Tārā:
Protect us whose strong adherence to and grasping at subject-object duality
Blinds us from realizing
The true nature of mind, non-dual wisdom.
I pray to the deity of omniscience, mother Tārā:
Protect us who, even though we abide in the midst of reality
Fail to recognise cause and effect and mutual dependence
And thus remain in confusion.
I pray to the fully awakened deity, mother Tārā:
Protect us who still remain unaware of the inseparability
Of the unelaborate, sky-like nature,
And everything it pervades.

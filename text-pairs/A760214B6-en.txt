Prayer of Truthful Words to Pacify the Fear of War
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Victorious Maitreya, sublime and noble Avalokiteśvara,
Ferocious king Hayagrīva, Jetsün Tārā, and the rest –
Buddhas, the mere sound of whose names dispels all fear;
Compassionate sources of refuge, pray grant me heed.
In this time when individuals experience an oceanic surge
Of negative karma and jealousy – the age of fivefold decadence and strife –
As intense suffering, fighting and quarrelling oppress us,
Pray burn it all in the fires of your compassionate wisdom.
Shower the nectar of love
Upon those who fan the flames of hatred.
Bless them to recognize one another as parents,
And thereby usher in auspiciousness and happiness.
May the mischievous elemental spirits
That enter the minds of beings
And instantaneously transform their hosts into warring titans,
Never hold sway in this region again.
May all who have died in battles, fighting and wars
Immediately give up their indulgence in destructive action, cause and effect,
And, having taken birth in the pure realm of Sukhāvatī,
Lead all to that same buddha realm.
May all beings have long, healthy lives,
Be free of quarrels and strife, live according to the ten virtues,
And experience timely rains and bountiful harvests;
And may the auspiciousness of the environment and beings increase exponentially.
May these pure, vast prayers be accomplished
Through the compassion of the Guru, Yidam, and Three Rare and Sublime Ones,
Suchness, which by its very nature is utterly pure,
And the appearance of things, the undeceiving nature of cause and effect.

For the Maṇi Reciter of Kham
Homage to the guru and Three Jewels!
From now until I reach the essence of awakening,
No matter where I may be reborn, in those places
May I always follow the Great Compassionate One
And dedicate my body, speech and mind to virtue.
Inspired by loving kindness and great compassion,
In order to lead all Mahākāruṇika's followers
To supreme and unsurpassable awakening,
May I carry out the Great Compassionate One's activity.

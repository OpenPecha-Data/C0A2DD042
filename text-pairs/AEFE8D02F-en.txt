Prayer for the Long Life of Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö and Khandro Tsering Chödrön
Namo guru!
Supreme embodiment of the oceanic activity of the secret body, speech and mind
Of Ösal Trulpé Dorje, 1 who was the actual manifestation
Of Vimalamitra, the master who attained immortality—
Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, may your life remain secure!
Manifestation of Dorje Tso, 2 the supreme companion
On the secret path of longevity, Tsering Chökyi Drönma, 3
May your three secrets reign victorious over danger, harm and adversity,
And may the youthfulness of immortality blossom!
Through the power and strength of praying in this way,
May I be accepted by the vidyādhara guru in all my lives to come,
May teacher and students come together in a single gathering
And signs of benefit and vitality proliferate among the teachings and beings!

In Praise of Padmākara, the Great Guru of Uḍḍiyāna
Most amazing wonder of these teachings,
Lotus King, mighty lord of this world,
As for your family, you were born a prince of Zahor,
In Uḍḍiyāna you cut through all misconceptions,
And in Śītavana you gained the two forms of attainment.
Throughout this world you tamed malevolent forces,
And in this Snowy Land you spread the teachings.
In the south-west borderlands now you subjugate the rākṣasas .
Not passing into nirvāṇa, but remaining as beings' only friend,
Supreme heruka in whom the three kāyas are inseparable,
Supreme guru without equal, I remember you now.

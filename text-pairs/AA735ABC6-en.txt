Cared for by an ocean of masters, unrivalled in their learning and accomplishment,
You studied and contemplated impartially on the Teachings of the Sage
Armoured with the altruistic wish to benefit the teachings and beings—

Bless me so that the vine of renunciation and bodhicitta
Is touched by the nectar of the four authentic empowerments,
Whereby the utpala flower of the practices of the generation and completion phase may blossom
And ripen into the fruit of the four kāyas!

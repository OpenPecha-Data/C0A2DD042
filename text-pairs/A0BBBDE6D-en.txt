The Bestowal of Supreme Immortality A Prayer to the Lineage of Mitrayogin’s White and Red Amitāyus
Kāya of Changeless Light pervading all existence and peace,
Master of the sambhogakāya complete with fivefold wisdom,
Nirmāṇakāya Amitāyus, who tames compassionately as required—
To you I pray: grant me the attainment of immortality!
The embodiment of bliss appearing in various illusory forms,
Arises as a goddess with the aspects of wisdom and emptiness,
Supreme mother of non-transferring longevity, Caṇḍālī—
To you I pray: grant me the attainment of immortality!
Vidyādhara who attained a deathless vajra form,
And adopted a pure light body of the wisdom of union,
Mitrayogin, crowning ornament of a hundred adepts—
To you I pray: grant me the attainment of immortality!
From the luminous expanse you arose as a vajra emanation,
Magnificently radiant as a hundred lights of stainless wisdom,
Glorious guru, who dispels the darkness in beings’ minds—
To you I pray: grant me the attainment of immortality!
Holders of the aural lineage of instructions from authoritative Heart-Essence transmissions,
Great paṇḍita of the five sciences, Chökyi Gyatso, 1
Who self-liberated all the various dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—
To you I pray: grant me the attainment of immortality!
By awakening the ground potential and through the yoga of the two stages,
May I dispel all impurities in the channels, wind-energies and essences,
Make firm the vital pillar of vajra-like non-transference,
And swiftly attain the three secrets of the Lord of Boundless Life!

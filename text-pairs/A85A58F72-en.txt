The Abbreviated Prayer in Seven Chapters
Emaho: O wonder!
The primordial buddha, the dharmakāya Samantabhadra,
The infinite buddhas in the mandalas of the saṃbhogakāya,
Nirmāṇakāya manifestations, who appear in every kind of form, to tame each in their own way:
Orgyen Rinpoche, you are the three kāyas, in one—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
Amitābha, Buddha of Boundless Light,
Avalokiteśvara, lord of the world and lord of love,
Wrathful heruka, who is chief of the mandala:
Orgyen Rinpoche, you embody them all—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
Born in the lotus blossom on Dhanakośa lake,
You ruled the realm as the Dharma King of Orgyen,
Unstained by ordinary birth, immaculate nirmāṇakāya:
Orgyen Rinpoche, without equal in all three worlds of existence—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
Completing your studies, you were supreme among the learned of the world;
Completing your yogic practice, you made the mamos your servants;
Completing your sādhana practice, you brought all appearance and existence under your control:
Orgyen Rinpoche, omniscient one—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
In central Tibet, you bound gods and spirits under oath,
You fulfilled all the intentions of the King,
Every single one of the fortunate disciples, you set upon the levels of vidyādharas:
Orgyen Rinpoche, supreme guide for living beings—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
For those with the karmic connection, you concealed a hundred thousand profound termas;
You made prophecies about future generations, as clear as if they were happening today;
You promised to care for us with your compassion, and without ever parting:
Orgyen Rinpoche, you who know past, present and future—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
“From here I shall go to Ngayab Pemé Ling,
But when every tenth day comes”, you said, “I shall return.”
With your love for sentient beings of this degenerate age, who look to you with devotion and yearning,
Orgyen Rinpoche, protector and refuge of all living beings
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
You have attained the vajra-like state of immortality,
You subjugate the ferocious rākṣasas in the south-west,
Your compassion more amazing than any other buddha:
Orgyen Rinpoche, sole refuge of all living beings—
To you we pray! Look on us with compassionate eyes!
Inspire us with your blessing! Guide us on the path to liberation!
From now, till we have attained liberation,
We have no other hope, no other source of refuge, but you.
Don’t ever turn away, but look on us with your eyes full of compassion,
Grant us attainments, ordinary and supreme,
Bless us to realize the primordial purity, the essence of rigpa,
And then become, swiftly, just like you!

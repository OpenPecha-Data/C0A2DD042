In Praise of the Protector Mañjughoṣa
Your beautiful and youthful body blazes in splendour with the major and minor marks,
Your speech proclaims the profound and vast Dharma in the divine voice of Brahmā,
And your mind possesses non-referential compassion endowed with twofold wisdom—
Protector Mañjughoṣa, to you I pay homage!

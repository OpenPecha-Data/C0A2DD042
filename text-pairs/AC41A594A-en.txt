A Prayer for the Swift Return of the Fourth Kyabje Dodrupchen Rinpoche
In these decadent times, you protected the teachings and those fortunate enough to follow you
With the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions of the path of the supreme vehicle,
The vajra pinnacle of natural luminosity, the tradition of the omniscient father and son, 1
Tupten Trinlé Palbar, to you I pray.
Protector, do not remain in the peace of the dharmadhātu,
But return as a glorious protector of the teachings and beings.
Reveal your youthful, moonlike emanation
To help us through the dark night of degeneration – return quickly, I pray.

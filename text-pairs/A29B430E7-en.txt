Prayer to Gyurme Tsewang Gyatso 1
I pray to the lord of the maṇḍala, seated amidst an ocean
Of absolute perfection, the purified dependent nature,
A vidyādhara with power over unchanging longevity,
In primordially immutable and vajra-like great bliss. 2
Through the blessings of the Mañjughoṣa Guru, 3
You came to hold a treasury of Dharma jewels, profound and vast,
And perfectly bound the bindu within the central channel—
Guru of genuine discipline, to you I pray.
Dance-like emanation, magical embodiment of the wisdom
Of the three secrets of the great translator Vairotsana,
Your activity to train the beings of this degenerate age—
Chimé Nangdzé Dorje, 4 to you I pray.

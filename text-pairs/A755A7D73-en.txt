Dhāraṇī of Goddess Parṇaśavarī
Miraculous manifestation arising from
The magical wisdom of all the victorious ones,
Goddess who pacifies all disease, harmful influences, and misfortunes
Of practitioners, to you I offer homage! 1
oṃ piśāci-parṇa-śavari sarva-jvara-praśamanaye svāhā
Through this merit, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Parṇaśavarī, and thereby
Every single being without exception
Reach that state of perfection too.

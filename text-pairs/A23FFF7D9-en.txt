The Swift Fulfilment of Aspirations A Prayer to Glorious Orgyen, King of Dharma
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Precious One of Oḍḍiyāna, you who are the sole embodiment
Of all the infinite victorious ones and Three Root throughout space and time,
Look upon me with compassion from Lotus Light in Cāmara.
I pray to you from the depths of my heart: inspire me with your blessings!
Transform all negative circumstances into the path of awakening,
Pacify all obstacles to the accomplishment of sacred Dharma,
Increase longevity, merit, resources, learning and realization,
And activate the great strength of awareness wisdom, I pray.
Cast open the great doors to ever deeper levels of insight,
Let us obtain the eight great treasures of courageous eloquence, 1
Expand the lotus garden of unbiased study, reflection and meditation,
And make us rich with the honeyed nectar of profound meaning.
In short, let all my own and others’ aspirations and actions
That accord with the Dharma, even those that are but fleeting,
All be fulfilled immediately, in the very instant of their creation,
And pacify obstacles, so that we may gain victory over Māra!

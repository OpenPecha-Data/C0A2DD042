Daily Practice of Dorje Gotrab 1
I am Vajrapāṇi, dark blue and ferocious,
Brandishing a vajra and serpent lasso.
Garbed in all the magnificent charnel ground accoutrements,
I stand with both legs in striding posture upon a lotus and sun,
Amidst an expanse of blazing wisdom fire.
From my body shoot out fiery garudas, iron scorpions,
Black boars, wind, flame and clouds of deadly poison,
All of them bursting forth like a raging hailstorm
To overcome illness, infectious disease, harmful influences and obstacles.

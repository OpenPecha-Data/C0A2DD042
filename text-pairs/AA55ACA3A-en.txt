Aspiration for Rebirth in Sukhāvatī
Homage to the bhagavan Amitābha!
Again and again I reflect on the Sukhāvatī realm.
With all my heart I recollect the guide Amitābha.
Single-pointedly I recall the oceanic retinue of bodhisattvas.
Grant your blessings, assembled guardians of the refugeless,
Before you all, protectors and embodiments of compassion,
I prostrate in devotion and present oceans of offering-clouds;
I confess all my misdeeds and downfalls and rejoice in virtue;
And I implore you to turn the Dharma Wheel, not pass into nirvāṇa.
So that I might accomplish complete and perfect awakening,
For the sake of beings as infinite in number as space is vast,
May I fulfil an ocean of aspirations towards liberation
With my perfected training in cultivating pure realms.
Through the virtue represented here, may I and all who possess a mind
Take birth in our next lives in that pure realm of Sukhāvatī,
Which is so sublime and wondrous in its features and design,
And there may we feast upon the teachings of the supreme vehicle.

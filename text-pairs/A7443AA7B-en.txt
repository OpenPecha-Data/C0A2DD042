The Swift Infusion of Blessings A Prayer to the Omnipresent Lord Vajradhara Jampa Kunga Tendzin
Namo gurave!
Embodiment of the wisdom of all the victorious ones and their heirs,
Omnipresent lord, glorious Vajradhara,
Foremost among the saffron-robed monks of this degenerate age,
Great all-knowing khenpo, to you I pray.
Outwardly restrained through the pratimokṣa vows,
Inwardly rich with the wealth of twofold bodhicitta,
And secretly realized as a mahāsiddha,
Great benevolent guide, to you I pray.
Endowed with the noble riches that delight all the learned ones,
Unrivalled teacher and author, whose vast assembly of students uphold the teachings,
Possessor of an immaculate resplendence,
Second lord of sages, at your feet I pray.
You bestow the splendour of great liberation
On all who see your form or read or hear your words,
And you spread the tradition of Kunga 1 in a hundred directions—
To you whose life of liberation is unequalled, I pray.
Your immaculate discipline enhances your youthfulness,
Your meditative absorption strengthens the nectar of great bliss,
And your profound wisdom perceives the nature of all things—
Great master of the threefold training, to you I pray.
Employing the ten principles of mantra, outer, inner and secret,
You perfected the yogas of generation and completion,
And through fourfold dissolution on the paths of the four empowerments,
Attained the supreme thirteenth bhūmi—to you I pray.
Master who emanates and absorbs an ocean of maṇḍalas,
Who possesses the supremely immutable great bliss of union,
Entirely filled with compassion, great and inexpressible by nature—
Guru Cakrasaṃvara, to you I pray.
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May the supreme guru always guide and care for me throughout all my lives,
May we spontaneously accomplish our own and others’ welfare,
And bestow the glory of benefit and happiness upon the teachings and beings.

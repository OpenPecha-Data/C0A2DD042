The Sweet Melody to Accomplish Words of Truth A Prayer for the Long Life of the Dharma-Expounding Guide Khenchen Khyenrab Chökyi Özer
Oṃ svasti.
Treasury of the compassion and blessings of the Mañjughoṣa guru,
Appearing as a guardian of the teachings and beings in this decadent age—
May the brilliant light from the wondrous masters of your lineage
Bring about auspiciousness for evermore.
In the adarśa of your pure and pristine knowledge 1
Are reflected the myriad modes of Dharma, outer and inner.
You who teach the excellent path to fortunate beings,
Jampa Chökyi Özer, may your life be long.
You who fearlessly explain with unfailing accuracy
The common and uncommon vehicles of sūtra and mantra,
According to the tradition of the omniscient sun of the teachings—
Second Candrakīrti, I pray that you live long.
Through the power of your understanding of the approach and exegesis
Of the Mañjunātha gurus of Sakya together with their lineage,
You carry the tradition of scripture and reasoning in the vessel of your mind—
Great and mighty expositor, I pray that you live long.
Outwardly, you are bound by observance of pure ethics;
Inwardly, you have mastered bodhicitta in your heart;
Secretly, your conduct is that of an adept of generation and completion—
Great vajra holder of the threefold vows, I pray that you live long.
Exponent of Dharma, adornment for the threefold world,
Remain as a beacon of light for all living beings
For as long as existence itself endures
And sound the great dharma-drum of sūtra and mantra!

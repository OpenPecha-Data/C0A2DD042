Guru Yoga of Jetsün Shepa Dorje Refuge & Bodhicitta Main Practice Visualization Mantra Recitation
Sentient beings of the six classes throughout the whole of space
Take refuge in the supreme guru.
To find freedom from the ocean of saṃsāric existence,
I set my mind that upon supreme awakening, in aspiration and in action.
Ah. My own perception is a vast realm of purity.
In its centre, supported by vast clouds of offerings,
Upon a white lotus and full moon disc
Is the lord of yogis, precious Milarepa.
He is pale blue, handsome and smiling, with long braided locks.
His right hand is held at the level of his ear;
His left, in the earth-touching mudrā, covers his knee.
He is naked but for a loincloth and cotton shawl,
And is seated with his two legs loosely crossed.
Light shines out from the three syllables at his three centres
To invite the wisdom form, who dissolves into him indivisibly.
I take refuge in the supreme guru.
I confess my misdeeds and harmful actions, one by one.
Precious lord, merely to remember you banishes all ills.
You who save from the strains of existence and quiescence,
Shepa Dorje, to you I pray:
Always inspire me with your blessings,
And bestow supreme and ordinary attainments.
oṃ āḥ guru hāsya vajra sarva siddhi hūṃ 1
Glorious guru, lord of yogins,
Supreme object of recollection Shepa Dorje,
Venerable Töpa Ga, ‘Joyous to Hear’,
As I pray to you single-pointedly,
Inspire me with your blessings and grant empowerment.
From the light rays at the guru's three secrets,
The syllables oṃ , āḥ , hūṃ and svāhā emerge
And dissolve into my own four centres,
Purifying obscurations and conferring empowerment and siddhis.
The seeds of the four kāyas are implanted in my mindstream.
The guru dissolves into me, inseparably.
And I rest in that natural and unaltered state of Mahāmudrā.
Sustaining an experience of timelessness beyond past, present and future,
I look into the Great Seal of appearance and existence.

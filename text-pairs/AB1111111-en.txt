The Precious Jewel Essence: A Prayer of the Four Dharmas
Orgyen Dorje Chang, my own father and guru,
May my mind turn towards the sacred Dharma,
All my thoughts and actions accord with the path of omniscience,
And my view, meditation and conduct be of Mahāyāna, the supreme and unmistaken path.
When deluded perception dawns as wisdom through practice,
May I be free from the bonds of the eight worldly concerns, and as I stay in solitary among mountains,
With the aspiration and action of bodhicitta, for the benefit of others,
May I act according to the glorious protector guru's wisdom transmission,
And seize the primordial stronghold.

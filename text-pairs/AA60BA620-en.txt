The Sweet Song of Virtue and Auspiciousness A Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama
Oṃ svasti.
You’re like a golden mountain bathed in saffron water
And embraced by the myriad rays of the rising sun,
Your fingers elegantly holding the wisdom sword—
Guru Mañjughoṣa, grant us virtue and excellence!
Upon the broad face of wisdom’s all-illuminating expanse,
As the moon of loving compassion displays its radiant smile,
Let the nectar of beneficent activity pervade the three worlds.
Gentle lord, second victorious one, grant us auspiciousness!
Venerable and mighty lord of speech, treasury of compassion,
Sole deity of this snowy land, holder of the white lotus,
Manifesting in the form of a triple-vowed virtuous friend,
Omniscient lord of the victorious, may your life remain secure.
As prophesied by the all-knowing Kinsman of the Sun,
You are the vow-keeping holder of kingly Lobzang’s way,
A magnificent leader among those who uphold the teachings.
May you remain forever upon the fearless lion’s dharma throne, I pray.
Sole adornment of the sea-cloaked earth, existence and peace,
Guru to all beings including the devas, Avalokiteśvara,
Whose three secrets are immutable, beyond transition and change,
May your lotus feet remain forever upon the vajra throne!
With your lotus feet upon the braided hair at the crowns
Of arrogant ones throughout the three planes of existence,
You are unequalled in mastery, rich with the glory of the ten strengths—
Guardian of the four aspects of perfect wellbeing, may your life remain secure!
With your magnificent fourfold activity that spontaneously accomplishes
The twofold benefit, you are like the sun and moon,
A wishing-granting jewel, a magical vase or tree,
The ground that sustains teachings and beings—may you remain for a hundred aeons!
With this prayer fulfilled precisely in this way
Through the blessed force of truth and the power
Of the precious Three Jewels, gurus, yidams and ḍākinīs,
May you remain as the crowning glory of the teachings and beings in the Land of Snows.
May all the ills of this age be pacified throughout every land and nation,
May harvests be plentiful, may everyone practise the ten virtuous deeds,
May the teachings flourish and those who uphold them multiply,
And may all live in harmony, with pure vows, rich in the threefold training.
As the root and branch of the teachings in this sacred land of Tibet,
May the three turnings of the Dharma Wheel long endure in veneration,
And may the spiritual and temporal power of the Ganden Podrang—
The palace of deathlessness and a hundred joys—never wane but extend everywhere throughout the world.

Prayer to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 1
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who received the Seven Authoritative Transmissions,
Regent of Padmasambhava, Pema Do-ngak Lingpa,
Ösal Trulpé Dorje, at your lotus feet,
I offer heartfelt prayers: inspire me with your blessings!
The Mañjughoṣa Guru’s manifestation,
Lodrö Gyatso, great charioteer of sūtra and mantra,
Bodhisattva Chökyi Lodrö, to you
I offer heartfelt prayers: inspire me with your blessings!
You who spread Padma’s profound, secret teachings in the ten directions,
Sun of Vajra Wisdom, Yeshe Dorje,
Transfer the blessings of your wisdom realization
And inspire me to accomplish my aspirations in accordance with the Dharma.

Brief Prayer to the Ḍākinī
Samantabhadrī, ḍākinī of unborn basic space,
Vajravārāhī, residing in the unimpeded sambhogakāya realm,
And Yeshe Tsogyal, nirmāṇakāya taming each according to their needs,
To you I pray: please bestow supreme and ordinary accomplishments!
The unsurpassed embodiment of all the victorious buddhas of the three kāyas,
The heruka, who is a brother to all ḍākinīs,
Khyentse Özer Jigme Lingpa—‘Light rays of wisdom and love’,
To you I pray: please bestow supreme and ordinary accomplishments!
The one to whom the essence of the oceanic nectar of his words and revelations
Was perfectly passed on through the channel of threefold faith,
Jigme Trinlé Özer Palbar— ‘Light rays of fearless activity blazing in splendour’,
To you I pray: please bestow supreme and ordinary accomplishments!
In the dharmakāya sky there gather clouds of compassion,
And the rain of the four empowerments showers down upon fortunate beings—
To the root and lineage masters who bestow the splendour of the four kāyas,
I pray: please bestow supreme and ordinary accomplishments!
Through the power and strength of this prayer of mine,
May all unfavourable circumstances and setbacks fade away,
May the qualities of the paths and stages increase like the waxing moon,
And may my own and others’ welfare spontaneously come to fruition!

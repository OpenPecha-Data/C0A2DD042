Visualisation and Mantra Recitation of the Great Compassionate One
Hrīḥ! I myself transform into the Great Compassionate One,
Brilliant white in color and with four arms—
Two of which are joined, and two of which hold a crystal rosary and a white lotus.
In full saṃbhogakāya attire, I sit with my two legs crossed.
At my heart is a syllable hrīḥ encircled by the six syllables.
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ

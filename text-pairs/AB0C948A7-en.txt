Prayer for this Life, the Next and the Bardos
Vimalamitra, who realized the maṇḍala of the supreme state,
Longchenpa, who revealed the dharmakāya Samantabhadra,
And Pema Ledrel Tsal, to you I pray:
Hold me with compassion in this life, the next, and the bardo state!
When the luminosity of the first bardo state arises,
May I recognise it, perfect the strength and gain stability,
Then, awakening in basic space with its six special features, 1
May I gain stability in the youthful vase body!
When the saṃbhogakāya appearances that are rigpa's expression arise,
May I find certainty, just like a child entering its mother's lap,
And, realizing the key point of engaging with lights and awareness,
May I attain buddhahood in saṃbhogakāya form!
When the karmic bardo of becoming arises,
Then, through relying upon the five means of enlightenment without meditation,
In a pure realm where the great relief of liberation is assured,
May I attain buddhahood in a single lifetime!

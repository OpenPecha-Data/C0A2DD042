Prayer for the Long Life of Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 1
Oṃ svasti!
Tsangpa Lha’i Metok, 2 Mañjughoṣa in person,
Intentionally took birth as the all-knowing Do-ngak Lingpa, 3
Whose activity, strength and splendour are all complete in you—
Chökyi Lodrö, at your feet I pray.
Langdro Lotsāwa, Lobzang Gyatso and the rest,
Directly appeared as the great pioneer of seven forms of transmission,
Whose supreme emanation you are, a master of an ocean of kama and terma —
To you I pray from the depths of my heart: inspire me with your blessings.
May you remain with your lotus feet forever secure upon the vajra throne.
From this moment on, until I reach the essence of awakening,
May you always guide and care for me, without ever parting,
May the teachings and beings meet with happiness and success,
And may I spontaneously accomplish my own and others’ benefit.

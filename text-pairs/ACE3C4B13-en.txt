Ripples on the Ganges In Praise of the Goddess Sarasvatī
Oṃ svasti!
Lady of language, who manifested from
The canine teeth of the lotus-like face
Of the sublime and noble moon of mercy— 1
Daughter of Brahmā, to you I offer praise!
Goddess of the vedas and of eloquence,
The one called Sarasvatī, 'She Who Flows',
Renowned throughout existence and peace—
Sweet Voiced Lady, to you I offer praise!
Your face is like the moon, a conch or water lily,
With blackish brows above blue lotus eyes.
You have a slender waist, high, alluring bosom,
And secret smiling lotus—to you I offer praise!
You bear the scent of white sandalwood,
And your mouth is graced with heavenly nectar.
The mere sight of you is enough to captivate
The three worlds—to you I offer praise!
All the buddhas, bodhisattvas,
Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas,
Devas, sages, and accomplshed vidyādharas—
They all—each and every one—bow to you!
Mother of the families of all maṇḍalas,
Supreme enacter of emanation and absorption,
Space-like mother, Prajñāpāramitā, Samantabhadrī—
Queen of vajra melody, to you I offer praise! 2
Through the virtuous force of this praise,
May my understanding of the profound and vast increase,
And, with the light of twofold wisdom expanded,
May I attain the supreme state of universal insight!

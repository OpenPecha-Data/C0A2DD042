Prayer for the Long Life of Soktse Rinpoche
Om svasti!
From the very beginning, beyond any transformation and change, birth and death,
The life-force of ever-youthful, indestructible wisdom pervading all—
May the fully accomplished Padma and the Lord of Boundless Life
Plant the pillar of indestructible life-force firmly here and now!
The essence of Samantabhadra’s wisdom mind is the supreme teaching of Ati.
Through your aspirations to uphold and spread these teachings and through the awakening of karmic connections,
You hoisted the victory banner of study and practice,
Protector of beings, may your life remain secure for aeons, we pray! 1
Through the swift path of the supremely secret teachings,
Your vast waves of activity benefit all with whom you are connected.
May all the pain and suffering of those to be trained be entirely cleared away,
And may everything be auspicious so that beings find benefit and happiness and the fulfilment of their every wish!

Short Praise of the Buddha's Deeds
When you were born, chief among human beings,
You took seven steps on this earth and said:
“In this world I am supreme.”
To you, O wise one, I pay homage! 1
First, you descended from the heaven of Tuṣita,
And in the royal home entered your mother’s womb;
In the grove at Lumbinī, O sage, you were born:
To the victorious ‘god among gods’, I pay homage!
You were tended by thirty-two nurses at the palace,
You spent your youth in sports at the house of the Śākyas;
At Kapilavastu you took Gopā as your wife:
To you who are unequalled in the three worlds, I pay homage!
At the four city gates, you were shown the four kinds of sorrow,
And cut your own hair in front of the Viśuddha Stūpa;
On the banks of the Nairañjanā you practised as an ascetic:
To you who are free from the faults of the two obscurations, I pay homage!
At Rājagṛha you tamed a rogue elephant,
In Vaiśālī the monkeys offered you honey;
In Magadha, O sage, you realized buddhahood:
To you in whom omniscient wisdom blossomed, I pay homage!
At Vārāṇasī you turned the wheel of Dharma,
And in the Jeta Grove you showed great miracles;
At Kuśinagara your wisdom mind passed into parinirvāṇa:
To you whose mind is like the sky, I pay homage!
Through the merit of this brief praise of
The deeds of the Enlightened One, Master of the Teaching,
May the actions of all living beings
Come to equal the acts of the Sugata himself.

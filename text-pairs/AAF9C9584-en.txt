The Prayer which is the Source of All True Realization
To the eight manifestations of Guru Rinpoche,
The eight great accomplished vidyādharas,
The eight great bodhisattvas,
The eight maṇḍalas of Kagyé with all their deities,
To you we pray—inspire us with your blessings!
Dispel all obstacles outer, inner and secret!
Fulfil all our aspirations!
Grant us attainments ordinary and supreme!

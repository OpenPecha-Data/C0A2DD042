Daily Confession (from the Vajrapa√±jara Tantra)
In the Three Jewels, I take refuge.
All my misdeeds, each and every one, I confess.
In the virtues of all beings, I rejoice.
Buddhahood and awakening, I hold in mind.
In the Buddha, the Dharma and Supreme Assembly
I take refuge until I attain enlightenment.
In order to accomplish my own and others' aims,
I generate bodhicitta, the spirit of awakening.
Having set my mind upon supreme awakening,
I invite all sentient beings to be my guests.
I shall carry out the supreme, delightful actions of a bodhisattva.
May I attain enlightenment in order to benefit all beings.

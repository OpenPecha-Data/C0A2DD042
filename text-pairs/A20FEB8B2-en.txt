Upon Arriving at Yangleshö
O Mañjuśrī, brave hero, all Conquerors’ activities gathered in one,
Dwell in my heart’s center, the youthful vase body’s expanse,
And let mind lineage’s 1 realization descend with great power,
Bringing blessings of supreme wisdom’s light!
Upon arriving at Yangleshö, 2 place sacred and supreme,
Deluded, impure appearances dissolve like rainbow mist.
No mere divine forms, wrought by paths of effort;
But definitive meaning I encounter, the magical net’s 3 true face.
Here all phenomena are pure as empty awareness alone,
All hope and fear’s grasping to things of life’s round and beyond, released.
When the delusion-destroying yogi rests in sweet repose,
Eloquent wisdom’s hundred doors are in a moment disclosed.
Happiness in this life is the goal lay folks seek,
Happiness in the next, the fruit sought by monks—
Golden leash or rope leash, they bind all the same,
Both ways make it hard to cross cliffs of hope and of fear!
The five poisoned thoughts that arose like foes before,
Today are pure as the essence of great empty awareness,
Dropping the tiring, meaningless four sessions’ succession,
The illusory yogi wishes but to lie in a bed of joy.
They say here, long ago, Loden Choksé Mañjuśrī, 4
Manifested the vidyādhara of the great seal. 5
Now I, the son, have caught up to his father,
Knotted hopes of further advice are undone, freed.
Seven in number gathered, same as royal treasures, 6
Enjoy a feast left by the line of vidyādharas past,
Soaring like garuḍas through the vidyādhara's four grounds, 7
Captains we’ll become, to guide all beings beyond bounds.

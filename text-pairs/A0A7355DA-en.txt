Emaho! In Dewachen, ‘Blissful’ pure realm of the west,
Amitābha’s compassionate blessing was aroused,
And he blessed his emanation, Padmasambhava,
To come into this world to bring benefit to all beings.
Compassionate one, you never cease to bring us help and well-being:
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
All the Dharma Kings, from Trisong Detsen
Down to the very end of the royal line,
Throughout past, present, and future, know your constant blessing.
One and only friend of Tibet’s Dharma Kings,
Compassionate one, you safeguard the lands that practise Dharma:
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
While your wisdom body subjugates the rakṣasas in the south-west,
You look on sentient beings everywhere with compassion,
Magnificent guide for sentient beings led astray by ignorance,
Skilfully you teach them, with their emotions so difficult to tame.
Compassionate one, your love is constant in its kindness and care:
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
Now, when this degenerate dark age reaches its final depths,
At dawn and at dusk you come, for those who have devotion,
Riding on the rays of the rising and the setting sun,
And on every tenth day of the waxing moon, you come in person.
Compassionate one, you act with vast power to help beings:
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
Now in this dark age, the age of conflict, the final era of five hundred years,
The five poisons of the negative emotions grow more violent in all sentient beings—
Recklessly we indulge in destructive emotions, and let the poisons dominate our minds.
At a time like this, let your compassion be our refuge and protection.
Compassionate one, you lead those with devotion to the higher realms:
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When terrifying armies of oppression encircle us,
Menacing the great centres of the Dharma with destruction,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, with your retinue of eight classes of gods and demons,
You will repel aggressors and their armies—of this we have no doubt!
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When sickness strikes, to destroy the fragile bodies of sentient beings,
When diseases plunge us into unbearable suffering and agony,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, embodiment of the Buddha of Medicine,
You will remove the obstacles that bring untimely death!
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When nature turns against us, and earth’s resources fail;

When the destined revealers retrieve hidden treasures for the benefit of beings,
In the courage and confidence of a samaya free of all pretence,

You will ensure the true heirs receive their father’s treasure—of this we have no doubt.
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When travelling through hidden lands, forests and deserted places,
When our way is blocked and we are cut off by storms, by rain and snow,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, surrounded by mighty local spirits,
You will lead us practitioners to the right path—of this we have no doubt!
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When vicious wild animals menace us—tigers, leopards, bears and poisonous snakes,
On our way through terrifying passes, wild and desolate places,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, along with your gings, warriors and protectors,
You will drive off these ferocious creatures—of this we have no doubt!
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!

When obstacles arise in earth, water, fire and air
To threaten these illusory bodies of ours with destruction,

O Guru Rinpoche, with the goddesses of the four elements,
You will harmonize the elements into their natural state—of this we have no doubt!

If murderous bandits and robbers attack us,

You will dispel the terror of all brutality and greed.
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When faced by killers on all sides,
Who threaten us with lethal weapons,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, the protection of your vajra tent
Will cause killers to panic and weapons to be scattered.
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When this lifespan is exhausted, and we come to die,
If we are racked by the intense anguish and pain of dying,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, as you are the emanation of Buddha Amitābha,
It is certain we will be born in ‘The Blissful’ pure realm of Dewachen:
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
Once this borrowed and illusory body is destroyed
In the bardo state when our deluded experiences, and our further delusions, arise to make us suffer,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, you who know past, present and future, through your compassion,
You will let all delusion be self-liberated—of this we have no doubt!
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When we are overwhelmed by karma and circumstance,
And suffer through grasping at delusion as real,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, King of Great Bliss,
You will utterly destroy the delusions that bring suffering.
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
When beings of all six realms are tormented by immense pain,
And especially when our leaders and people are engulfed in suffering,
With intense longing and devotion, from the depths of our hearts,
With no trace of doubt or hesitation we pray:
O Guru Rinpoche, with your unchanging, unwavering compassion—watch over us!
To the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Grant your blessing, so all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!

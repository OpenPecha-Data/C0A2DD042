Prayer for Swift Rebirth of Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 1
Guide and lord of Dharma, Mañjughoṣa in person,
Return intentionally by adopting a rūpakāya form.
For how could you discontinue your care for us
While remaining in the bliss of the dharmakāya expanse?
Supremely intelligent and compassionate warrior,
Do not delight in the savour of quiescence, I pray,
But, with the great love that does not forsake disciples,
Swiftly reveal your emanated representation for this time.
Then, freed from obstacles and the veils of obscuration,
Let this supreme maṇḍala of splendorous knowledge and love
Shine brightly in the sky of the entire teaching of the Victorious, and
For the fortunate, cause the lotus garden of benefit and happiness to bloom.

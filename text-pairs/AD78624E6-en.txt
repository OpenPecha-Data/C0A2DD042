Guru Yoga of Milarepa Shepa Dorje for Daily Practice
Majestic Shepa Dorje
Is seated at the crown of my head upon cushions of lotus and moon.
He is pale green, 1 dressed in robes of white cotton,
His long hair falling over his shoulders.
An imposing figure, he sits with splendour
Amidst a swirl of wisdom’s rainbow light;
His right hand is at his right ear,
And his left rests in his lap holding a skull-cup,
As he sings a stream of spiritual vajra songs.
Think lovingly of me and grant your blessings, so that:
I may actualize the five kāyas and five wisdoms,
And see my own true face, the natural state,
Thoughts may become meditation,
Negative circumstances may help my path,
Negative action, sin, and obscuration may be purified,
Deviations in the view may be overcome,
I may become disenchanted with saṃsāra,
And I may achieve the rainbow body and accomplish Khechara. 2
oṃ āḥ guru hāsa vajra hūṃ 3
Finally, like a water bubble dissolving back into water,
Lordly Shepa Dorje dissolves into me,
And I rest in equipoise,
My mind free of all elaboration and duality.
Through this merit, may I swiftly
Accomplish Mahāmudrā,
And go on to establish all beings
In that same state.

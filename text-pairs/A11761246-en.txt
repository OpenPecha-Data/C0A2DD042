A Concise Guru Yoga
Above my head on a blossoming lotus and sun and moon disc seat,
Appears Guru Padmākara, the Lotus Born,
Embodiment of all the Victorious Ones.
Embodiment of buddhas of past, present and future, Guru Rinpoche;
Master of all siddhis, Guru of Great Bliss;
Dispeller of all obstacles, Wrathful Subjugator of Māras;
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessing,
So that outer, inner and secret obstacles are dispelled,
And all my aspirations are spontaneously fulfilled.
From the four centres on the Guru’s body
Light radiates out and dissolves into my four centres.
Through this, the four obscurations are purified and I obtain the four empowerments.
Guru Padmākara dissolves into light and becomes one with me,
And I meditate on the inseparable unity of the Guru and my own mind.
Lotus-Born, you are inseparable from our original nature.
Your realm, the Copper-Coloured Mountain of Glory,  is our experience in its purity.
May we take birth in this primordially pure realm,
The uncontrived natural state—appearance and awareness indivisible!

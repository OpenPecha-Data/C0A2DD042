Aspiration for the Spread of the Teachings of the Eight Chariots of the Practice Lineage
Countless aeons ago, with a motivation
Of intense compassion, you took on the burden
Of caring for this realm in a dark and turbulent age—
Supreme guide, Lord of Sages, consider this, I pray!
When the essential traditions of your supreme vehicle
Spread to this frigid and snowy land, there arose
What became known as the eight chariots of the practice lineage—
May their teachings and adherents spread far and wide!
The excellent unrivalled path that upholds, preserves and spreads
The traditions of the general Buddhadharma and three yogas of the inner tantras,
Especially the luminous vajra essence— 1
May the teachings of the Lake-Born Conqueror flourish and spread!
Exercising restraint through the three immaculate trainings,
And relying on the Lord of Sages, Avalokiteśvara, Tārā and Acala
As infallible and enduring sources of protection—
May the teachings of the Jowo Kadampas flourish and spread!
Skilled in upholding Atiśa’s sublime tradition in particular
Through flawless study and practice and pure Vinaya observance,
And able thereby to nourish the entire wealth-bearing world—
May the teachings of the Riwo Gendenpas flourish and spread!
Upon the basis of the wisdom intent of the five patriarchs, 2
Compassionate emanations of the wisdom being Mañjuśrī,
Emphasising the practices of Hevajra and Path with its Fruit—
May the glorious Sakya teachings flourish and spread!
Teachings from the lineage of the mahāsiddhas Nāropa and Maitripāda,
The tradition of practising the six dharmas as the path of skilful means
And the Great Seal (Mahāmudrā) as the path of liberation—
May the teachings of the Kagyüpas, protectors of beings, flourish and spread!
In addition, may all the pure, nonsectarian teachings of the victorious ones,
Such as the Pacification, Shangpa Kagyü, Jonang,
Approach and Accomplishment and so on,
Continue to flourish and spread even unto the ends of existence!
Through the blessings of the Three Jewels, Three Roots and Dharma Guardians,
And through the power of the pure dharmatā and phenomenal interdependence,
May all the hopes and aspirations within my mind—
Each and every one of them—be perfectly fulfilled, I pray!

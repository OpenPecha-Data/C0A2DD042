The Noble Account of Dharma The Teaching by the Child Inconceivable Radianc
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Bhagavān was residing in Śrāvastī, in the Jeta Grove of Anāthapiṇḍada’s park
together with a great saṅgha of one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikṣus and a full five hundred additional bodhisattvas
While the Bhagavān was residing in the town of Śrāvastī
its king and his senior ministers, the brahmins, householders, and people from the greater township, along with their families, paid respect, offered reverence and veneration, and presented offerings to the Bhagavān so that he received much fine food, drink, and other items to be eaten and sipped
He was a blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, one with perfect knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who tamed beings, an unexcelled being, and a teacher of gods and humans
The Blessed Buddha was renowned for his outstanding caste, outstanding clan, outstanding patrilineage, outstanding discipline, outstanding absorption, outstanding insight, outstanding liberation, and outstanding wisdom vision of liberation
The Bhagavān’s fame and renown was thus widespread throughout the world
The Blissful One, the knower of the world, the charioteer who tames beings, the unexcelled being, the teacher of gods and humans, the blessed Buddha, was also teaching the Dharma
That is, he was genuinely and fully teaching the sanctified conduct: what is virtuous at first, in the interim, and in the end, what has excellent meaning and excellent words, and what is unadulterated, perfect, pure, and cleansed
He was also in possession of the five eyes
namely the eye of flesh, the divine eye, the eye of Dharma, the eye of insight, and the eye of a buddha
The Bhagavān had soundly defeated non-Buddhist schools such as the carakas, the parivrājakas, and the followers of the Nirgrantha Jñātiputra
Gods and humans wholly adopted the Bhagavān’s teachings and so they spread everywhere
Early one morning, the Bhagavān dressed in his Dharma robes and skirt an
took up his alms bowl. The assembly of bhikṣus, the saṅgha of bhikṣus, along with the bodhisattva mahāsattvas, surrounded him and accompanied him
He was beautiful to behold from the front, the right, and the left; his strides were beautiful
Wearing the Dharma robes—the outer robe, the upper robe, and the inner robe—and the strainer and the alms bowl, he was beautiful
His complexion was golden, and he radiated an aura of light a full arm span around him. It was like a mass of fire amidst the darkness of night
like the full moon on the fifteenth lunar day, and like the shining of the sun. He possessed the thirty-two signs of a superior being
They went to receive alms in the town of Śrāvastī
and at the very moment that the Bhagavān set his foot down at the threshold of the gate, reaching the town
some magnificent, amazing, miraculous feats took place
I shall recount the incredible, great miracles that occurred when the holy being, the Guide, arrived
so listen with a most faithful heart
Those who were blind were able to see
Those who were deaf were able to hear
The naked found clothing
Those with mental illness regained their faculties
All the townsfolk joined their palms in reverence
offering homage to the Blissful One
The pleasant sounds of great gongs, earthen drums, and steel drums were audible, although none were struck
Ducks, geese, herons, peacocks, parrots, and cuckoos voiced their delightful songs
Those who had lost their fortunes recovered them
Vessels made of gold and silver rang out, although none were struck
The earth itself rumbled and shook six times
and no beings were left without refuge
as their minds were filled with sincere trust
Wherever strode the feet of the most eloquent and holy Buddha, there appeared immaculate lotuses in elegant arrangements
Those beings born in the animal realm who saw him found happiness and would be reborn in the higher realms
Those women who were pregnant gave birth, without the slightest discomfort, to fine-featured, attractive babies
No beings harmed one another out of attachment, aversion, or indifference
They spoke to one another in the most non-aggressive manner
the way a father or mother would speak to an only child
The sides of the road became beautifully decorated
All the gods dwelling in the heavens above copiously tossed flower petals
There were no beings left who underwent suffering
Beings who had been ill became free from illness and so felt happy
As the Blissful One passed by, each person wondered, “Is the Tathāgata looking at me alone?
They each thought, “I shall make my own offering of alms and so reap the exact result of offering alms to the guide of humans.
It was not at all easy to fathom what occurred just from him passing by
Then, the Bhagavān went out to receive alms, making his rounds through the town of Śrāvastī
The Bhagavān reached a place near the center of town where a fine-figured, lovely, and attractive child had been left all alone inside a deserted dwelling
The child was sitting there sucking on his right thumb
A number of dogs, or jackals, had gathered inside the empty house and were approaching the child and licking him
However, due to his past virtues, these animals caused no harm to the young child
Some of the townsfolk were also going in and out of the deserted building
Seeing the townsfolk coming and going, the Bhagavān knowingly directed Venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, go and see what is inside that deserted house, the one all those townsfolk are entering and leaving.
As he had been commanded by the Bhagavān, Venerable Ānanda went to the deserted house, and upon arriving saw a fine-figured child, beautiful and lovely to behold, sitting there sucking on his right thumb and staring openly at the crowd of people around him
After seeing this, Venerable Ānanda returned to the Bhagavān and reported
“Bhagavān, inside that deserted house is an abandoned child whose body is well formed, beautiful, and attractive, like a precious jewel
He sits there gazing with wide eyes at all the people gathered around him.
The Bhagavān thought, “Aha! This child, through his outstanding training in previous lives, has the ability to understand the meaning of my teachings, and so is most fortunate!
Out of affection for that child, and in order to lead the common folk to virtue, he went to the deserted dwelling
When the Bhagavān reached the dwelling, he entered an
took a seat to the side of the child and then addressed the following verse to him
“Frequented by snakes and yakṣas, This charnel ground is most frightening
How could a child not be frightened here?And yet, here you are now, all alone!
Through the power of the Buddha and as a result of his own prior roots of virtue, the child then responded to the Bhagavān with these verses
“Mighty Sage, who should feel fear Toward phenomena that have no self-identity
Omniscient One, supreme speaker, Whatever the action through which I came to be here
“There is no self nor something done by a self
For the self does not belong to anything at all
I see no self belonging to someone
Nor do I see someone belonging to a self.
The Bhagavān replied
“Evil actions performed in the past Have ripened in this way
Abandoned in this deserted house
Surely you are experiencing feelings of suffering.
The child asked
“Gautama, do you still perceive That there is a deserted house
Didn’t you fully understand perception While on the seat of awakening?
The Bhagavān answered
“I fully understand perception
And I myself have no perceptions
Rather, it is out of love for you That I have come to this deserted house.
The child asked
“When, no matter how hard you look, Sentient beings are never to be found
Where does compassion arise?Toward whom is your love directed?
The Bhagavān answered
“These beings do not know emptiness, The peace of no self-identity
And so, out of love for those very beings, I engage in meritorious action.
The child asked
“Although he has fathomed the empty and tranquil
And realized tranquil emptiness, Could it be that the Tathāgata Still has not rid himself of error?
The Bhagavān answered
“Having realized the peace of emptiness
The Guide delivers this Dharma teaching In order to mature beings
That is the compassion of the buddhas.
The child asked
“Tathāgata, yet again, You have not rejected your error
If there is no perception of beings, Where could compassion possibly arise?
The Bhagavān answered
“Having embraced well the awakening mind, Superior people don their armo
And naturally bestow blessings Upon nonexistent beings.
The child said
“Since nowhere is an entity observed, All armor, in fact, is unreal
For phenomena that have no substance, There is no armor to be found.
The Bhagavān answered
“Although phenomena have no substance, This Dharma taught to living creature
Is the vibrant display of compassion Of the lord protectors of the world.
The child asked
“As for Dharma, if words do not exist
Where else could instructions be
Might you be misleading worldly beings
Or are you teaching Dharma that is not Dharma?
The Bhagavān answered
“I do not deceive the world
Nor do I profess what is not Dharma
What I do is remove the mental disturbances Of mistaken beings.
The child asked
“As a root of mental disturbances does not exist
They have no location, Neither inside nor outside
So how can mental disturbances be purified?
The Bhagavān answered
“Things that arise from error Are born entirely of imputation
And so, to rid them of all concepts, I teach the Dharma to living beings.
The child said
“No matter how many imputations you seek
Mind is by nature luminosit
In which mental disturbance does not occu
And which never becomes disturbed.
The Bhagavān answered
“It is just as you say
Mind is ever luminous, and yet Provisional, proximal disturbance
Disturb the minds of ordinary beings.
The child asked
“If mental disturbances are not there to se
And are not present from their own side
How can they be provisional
That is the question; please explain this to me.
The Bhagavān answered
“Consider how clouds appear in the sky, But are not as they appear
The arising of mental disturbances is like that
They too appear, yet are not that way.
The child said
“Any phenomenon unmistaken in nature Simply remains that way; that is how it is
No mistaken nature can be seen In a phenomenon whose nature is unmistaken.
The Bhagavān answered
“It is those with childish perception Who falsely conceive such things to be
And tathāgatas who appear in order To bring their minds to realization.
The child asked
“Considering they are not born, Which perfect buddhas could appear
The appearance of a buddha makes no sense Where phenomena themselves have no birth.
The Bhagavān answered
“The appearance of a buddha Is explained as birthless birth
A conventional designation That ultimately does not exist.
The child said
“You still have two perceptions, One conventional and one ultimate
Which contradicts the path of one vehicle That you profess, Gautama.
The Bhagavān answered
“I do not transgress the path
I remain without contradiction and
moreover, Bring discordant beings into harmony
That is how you should understand it, child.
The child asked
“If those beings are not perceived
Then to whom, Gautama, are you bringing harmony
When you look at the past of phenomena—To whom has affliction arisen?
The Bhagavān answered
“Having comprehended the past, the future, And likewise what transpires right now
Having realized sacred awakening, I teach the Dharma to living creatures.
The child said
“You proclaim yourself the perfect Buddha, And proclaim your own understanding
Promoting yourself in this manner, Your pride must be truly exceptional!
The Bhagavān answered
“I do not laud myself, Nor do I belittle others
I clearly reveal how things truly are, And so am called the Tathāgata.
The child said
“If how things truly are is inexpressible And without a true nature
Then don’t speak contrary to your own understanding, Using terminology for what has no words, no language.
The Bhagavān answered
“Although all those phenomena are contrary
They still arise from the natural state of things
Because I have realized how things truly are
I possess neither faults nor qualities.
The child said
“Through the power of the Tathāgata, My confidence has grown
And so I ask forgiveness of the perfect Buddha For all these answers I have requested.
Then, the Bhagavān drew his right hand, golden in color, from his Dharma robe an
reached out toward the child, who took hold of the finger of the Bhagavān’s hand and stood up
The Bhagavān carried the child out of the empty house and set him down on the road
The people gathered there thought, “This child was disturbed in just this way, and yet he was able to engage in such a debate regarding the qualities of the great being. The blessed buddhas truly are remarkable!” And as it was indeed remarkable
they offered sincere homage to the Bhagavān
The Bhagavān then spoke the following words to the child
“Child, since your obscuration of karma has been exhausted
remember your previous roots of virtue and make them known to this great crowd of people
Show them a great miraculous feat!
The child then floated up from the ground to the height of about seven persons, and from his body streamed light, which spread until it illuminated all of Śrāvastī, and the world of Jambudvīpa in its entirety
The light drew the rapt attention of Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, and many hundreds of thousands of other gods
all of whom in that second, in that very moment, in that instant, went to where the Bhagavān was and bowed their heads to his feet in homage
They tossed divine flowers to the Bhagavān and proclaimed
“O Bhagavān! This bodhisattva is inconceivably radian
such that he illuminates this buddhafield with light
and so he serves the welfare of innumerable beings!
That is how that child came to be named Inconceivable Radiance
The Bhagavān also said, “Let this child be called Inconceivable Radiance,” and so he rejoiced in that name for the child
The child Inconceivable Radiance then descended from the sky an
came to rest on the ground. Through the power of the Buddha and his own prior roots of virtue, what transpired next happened like this
by the time he took a seat, the child’s body had grown to that of an eight-year-old child
Then, the lord of gods Śakra presented the child with a bolt of heavenly fabric
saying, “Dear child, out of loving concern for me, wear this length of fabric. Don’t remain naked!
The child Inconceivable Radiance then spoke these words to Śakra, the lord of gods
“Kauśika, it is not by wearing lovely clothes that bodhisattvas are made beautiful, but rather their beauty comes from bearing the ornaments of Dharma
Kauśika, it may be obvious, but nonetheless, let me tell you what the ornamental clothing of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas is
“The ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas is the awakening mind
for it adorns the seat of awakening
The ornaments of modesty and propriety are the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for they support all beings
“Observing their commitments is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it perfects their insight
Their intent is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it eliminates deceit and guile
“Application is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it perfects all virtuous qualities
Superior intention is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it sets them apart from all others
“Absence of pride is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it perfects their wisdom
Their pursuit of Dharma and longing for Dharma are the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for these perfect their insight
“Their lack of parsimony as preceptors is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it perfects their dispassionate wisdom
Their utter disregard for all wealth is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it perfects their excellent marks and signs
“Pure discipline is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for it brings their aspirations to completion
Acceptance and gentleness are the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for they become words that resound and roar like the voice of Brahmā
“Stable resolve and fortitude are the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for these fulfill all their goals
Their attainment of concentrations, liberations, absorptions, and equilibria are the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for these perfect the wisdom of highly advanced cognition
“The insight of knowing how to parse words carefully is the ornamental clothing of the bodhisattvas
for it eliminates latent tendencies, beliefs, and manifest afflictions
Great compassion is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for they never become discouraged in saṃsāra
“Bearing no animosity toward any being is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
for they never lose interest in the welfare of self and other
Teaching Dharma without material interest is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
because insight liberates both self and other
“Accomplishment of Dharma is the ornamental clothing of bodhisattvas
since it removes all mental disturbances
Kauśika, in this way you must see how bodhisattvas who possess ornaments of Dharma like these are never naked.
The lord of gods Śakra was greatly pleased with the child and trusted in him
and so, addressing the Bhagavān, he asked
“Out of loving consideration for me, would the Bhagavān please tell him to accept this length of fabric?
The Bhagavān then spoke to the child Inconceivable Radiance, saying
“Child, take this length of fabric and put it on.
The child Inconceivable Radiance then went over to the Bhagavān
knelt with his right knee on the ground
pressed his palms together in salutation toward him
and then, in his presence, accepted the length of fabric and put it on
The Bhagavān then went to receive alms in the town of Śrāvastī
The men and women, boys and girls, merchants and brahmins, householders, and the king and his major officials were amazed an
assembled there to look upon the child Inconceivable Radiance, to look upon the Bhagavān, and to show them honor and homage
The Bhagavān accepted the offering of alms from each in turn an
then went to the home of the mother of the child Inconceivable Radiance
When he arrived there, however, he said nothing and simply remained off to one side
Embarrassed, the mother of the child Inconceivable Radiance did not come out to the entrance to greet the Bhagavān
The child Inconceivable Radiance went inside his home and then spoke the following verses to his mother
“It was due to my own past misdeeds That I entered your womb
Not because of any fault of yours, mother; That being so, don’t feel ashamed
“Since you created me with love
I am the one indebted to you
Don’t be embarrassed or shy away. Come before the Tathāgata
“My entry into your womb Was an endowment you received well
Come share with the Great Guide as well The virtuous deeds of your body!
The child Inconceivable Radiance then spoke to the lord of gods Śakra, saying
“Kauśika, give me some heavenly mandārava flowers, divine incense, and godly raiment
I shall give them to this mother who gave birth to me
By presenting them as a gift to the Bhagavān
she will generate the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
And so the lord of gods Śakra gave the child heavenly mandārava flowers, divine incense, and godly raiment
The child Inconceivable Radiance then spoke the following verses to his mother
“Mother, take these heavenly mandārava flowers, So lovely to behold and enjoyable
Along with this incense and clothing, And offer them to this great man, the Buddha
“Gifts made in this world to one’s parents, such as food and drink, Money and clothes, are not offerings at al
Compared with what connects them to Dharma; Therefore, make an offering of these items
“Make an offering to this holiest of humans
And firmly aspire to supreme awakening
Time and again, I have been at your side
For so very long have I encouraged you
“Without feeling unworthy or ashamed
But with a renewed sense of joy and delight
Proceed to where the genuine Victor awaits
And offer homage at the feet of this supreme being
“Handing flowers over to the Lord
Along with incense and clothing, Generate the roots of virtue from that Victor
And generate too the resolve for supreme awakening
“Having set your resolve for supreme awakening
Then, as is said, ‘the Lord of the World assures full maturatio
To those who, with faith, pay respect to a Victor.’Go petition this genuine Victor!
The woman then went over to the Bhagavān and offered homage by prostrating to his feet
made offerings to him, and put her request to him fully and respectfully
just as she had been instructed. After she had made this request
the Bhagavān told her
“Through this accomplishment of roots of virtue you shall not go to the lower realms or an unfortunate state
Having pleased millions upon millions of buddhas, you shall yourself become a buddha, the holiest of persons.
When he had finished receiving alms in the town of Śrāvastī
the Bhagavān, accompanied by the child Inconceivable Radiance and other lay people
left the town and returned to the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park
The Bhagavān then took his meal
arose from his inner absorption, and readied himself to make the Dharma heard
The king of the state of Kośala, Prasenajit, accompanied by his four military regiments, came to see the Bhagavān in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park. As he and his men arrived
they offered homage by prostrating to the Bhagavān’s feet an
then sat off to one side
Once they were seated at his side
the king of the state of Kośala, Prasenajit, said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān
where is the child Inconceivable Radiance, who possesses such wondrous and amazing qualities?
The Bhagavān then pointed out the child Inconceivable Radiance
and King Prasenajit could see at first sight that the child’s physical body was fully developed, with a complexion superior to that of the gods, an
that he was graced with fearlessness, disciplined conduct, absorption, and insight
The king therefore thought to himself
“Imagine what kinds of deeds he must have performed and accumulated in the past to have a pure body like that!
The child Inconceivable Radiance, due to the power of the Buddha and because of his own past roots of virtue, knew in his mind what King Prasenajit had thought
So he said
“Those who consistently possess a loving and pure mind
Are not fractious, but gentle and thoughtful
As well as well-mannered, honest, and chaste
It is they who become pure in body
“Those who abandon and abstain from wrong actions
Who never devalue but increase virtue
Who entirely reject malice and hostility— It is they who become pure in body
“Those who continually and respectfully make offerings To the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgh
And don’t feel aggression toward or threaten others—It is they who become pure in body
“Those who are not jealous, Miserly, or otherwise prideful toward other
And say nothing when others’ faults arise—It is they who become pure in body
“Those who never look to blame, Reproach, or rebuke other
Or look for a chance to exploit them—It is they who become pure in body.
King Prasenajit then said to the Bhagavān
“Bhagavān, since this child Inconceivable Radiance clearly possesses such great qualities
what sort of obscuration of karma caused him to be born from the womb of a woman without a husband and later abandoned in that empty dwelling?
The Bhagavān answered him, “Great king
once, in the distant past, ninety-one eons ago
the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, the one with perfect knowledge and conduct, the blissful one, the knower of the world, the charioteer who tames beings, the unexcelled, the teacher of gods and humans, the blessed buddha known as Vipaśyin appeared in the world
“Great king, in those days, at that time
there were two bodhisattvas, Divine Excellence and Earth, who attended the sublime discourses of the blessed buddha Vipaśyin
In particular, the bodhisattva known as Divine Excellence was one who would no longer regress
he had few pursuits and few activities, enjoyed solitude, and was filled with loving kindness due to his powers of concentration and advanced cognition
“As for the bodhisattva known as Earth, he was not very well versed in the Dharma an
so served as the attendant of Divine Excellence
He frequently went into neighboring villages, towns, townships, and palaces an
there would busy himself with many tasks and activities
Thus, the bodhisattva Divine Excellence would reprimand him, saying, ‘Why are you busying yourself with so many tasks and activities instead of putting your effort into practice and renunciation?
“Over and over again Divine Excellence exhorted him, making Earth irritated and agitated, turning him unpleasant and then abusive, until he became both physically and mentally malicious
He voiced his vile thoughts in the coarsest language, saying
‘You bastard, you son of a whore, your father was a cuckold. Since you don’t even have a proper father and mother
it is ridiculous to think that you could have insight or disciplined conduct.
“With the worst intentions he spoke these crude words, and without confession, contrition, or rejection
he held his grudge, continuing to harbor ill will toward the bodhisattva Divine Excellence, and he had not the slightest affection for him
“The bodhisattva Divine Excellence, moreover, thought that Earth was no longer a fitting vessel and withdrew from him, spurring Earth to think even worse of the bodhisattva Divine Excellence and to speak to him in the most uncomplimentary, caustic, unvenerable, and unmeasured terms
“Because of the karma Earth accumulated and gathered in this way, his body was ruined, and in the wake of his death, he was reborn to a woman who gave birth to him out of wedlock
Because he had maintained the awakening mind, however, his actions did not cause him to take rebirth as a being in hell
“As soon as he was born, the woman abandoned him along a major thoroughfare
where he was eaten by dogs, jackals, and wolves
Great king, in a similar fashion, over the course of ninety eons, he suffered like this, in the same miserable way
he died and was reborn and once reborn was abandoned
The common folk would say, ‘That bastard, that child of a whore—let the dogs, jackals, and wolves eat him!
“Great king, if you are uncertain, if you entertain doubt as to whether the one known as the bodhisattva Earth in those days, at that time
may have been someone else, you need not wonder any longer
If you ask, ‘Why is that?
Well, it is because this child Inconceivable Radiance was the one known in those days, at that time, as the bodhisattva Earth
“Great king, his obscuration of karma has now been exhausted
His impure mind has been purified
He has pleased the Tathāgata
Cutting off rebirth in all the lower realms, this child Inconceivable Radiance has pleased sixty-four million buddhas
has honored them, venerated them, and revered them, and has conducted himself with sanctity before them
He has been diligent in the dedicated pursuit of Dharma as well
“Great king, through his past roots of virtue, he has achieved this illustrious state
Great king, in this way, black deeds and white deeds are never squandered
Great king, since that is the case, the wise are circumspect about their physical, verbal, and mental acts
abstaining from evil even at the cost of their lives.
The king of the state of Kośala, Prasenajit, then asked the Bhagavān
“Bhagavān, the bodhisattva who was called Divine Excellence
did he ever attain unsurpassed and perfect awakening? O
is he still, even now, engaging in the conduct of a bodhisattva?
The Bhagavān answered him
“Great king, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Divine Excellence conducts himself with sanctity in the buddha realm of the tathāgata Akṣobhya
where he is known as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Śrīsambhava.
The king of Kośala, Prasenajit, then said to the Bhagavān
“Bhagavān, a noble son or daughter is supposed to act respectfully
to serve spiritual masters
to attend them
and to venerate them
One may ask, ‘What is the value of doing so?
“Bhagavān, if one attends, serves, an
venerates a spiritual master, one acquires virtuous qualities
Through acquiring virtuous qualities, one’s frame of mind becomes virtuous
When one’s frame of mind is virtuous, one trains in virtue
“Through training in virtue, one performs virtuous deeds
Through virtuous deeds, one will have a virtuous existence
Due to a virtuous existence, one enjoys virtuous companions
In virtuous company, sinful acts are not performed
One will not engage in sinful acts
“By abstaining from sinful acts and engaging in virtue, one will not be tormented
and others will not be tormented
Through affording protection to oneself and others, the path to awakening will be completed
“By staying on the path to awakening, one will have the ability and opportunity to effectively serve the welfare of beings who have embarked on inferior paths.
The Bhagavān remarked, “Great king, well said
Well said! You have spoken well
Great king, by serving one’s spiritual master
one will perfect all the qualities that characterize a bodhisattva mahāsattva.
The child Inconceivable Radiance then said to the Bhagavān
“Bhagavān, what are the various qualities a bodhisattva should possess in order to swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood an
to gain acceptance of even the most profound Dharmas?
The Bhagavān responded
“Child, a bodhisattva who possesses four qualities will swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and gain acceptance of even the most profound Dharmas
What are these four
“They are comprehension of interdependence; rejection of eternalism and nihilism
the understanding that there are no beings, no living creatures, and no persons
and an interest in and experience of emptiness
“A bodhisattva who possesses these four qualities will swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood an
gain acceptance of even the most profound Dharmas
“Child, in addition, a bodhisattva who possesses four other qualities will swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood
What are these four
“Leaving the past behind, not projecting into the future, knowing how to extinguish what arises right now, and knowing the sameness of the three times—those are the four
“There is yet another set of four
What are the four
Physical isolation, mental isolation, isolation from phenomena, and isolation from action—those are the four
“There are another four
What are they
Seeing the Buddha as reality itself and not as a form
seeing the Dharma as detachment from desire and not as terms and definitions
seeing the saṅgha as noncomposite and not as an assemblage
and purification of the eyes of insight—those are the four
“There are four more
What are they
They are perfecting the six transcendent virtues by not relinquishing the modes of attraction
expertise in insight and skillful means
precise discernment that there are no beings; and great compassion
“Child, a bodhisattva who possesses these four qualities will swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood an
gain acceptance of even the most profound Dharmas.
As the Bhagavān gave this teaching presenting the fourfold attainments, the child Inconceivable Radiance gained acceptance of the fact that phenomena do not arise an
was so joyous, so overjoyed, that he himself actually floated up into the sky to the height of seven palm trees
At that point, the Bhagavān smiled
As is the nature of things when blessed buddhas smile
lights of various colors radiated from the mouth of the Bhagavān
The lights appeared in many different colors, such as blue, yellow, red, white, violet, and silver
Those multicolored lights illuminated the infinite and boundless worlds of the universe
manifesting even as far as Brahmā’s domain and making the very sun and moon seem lackluster
The lights then reversed course and vanished into the crown of the Bhagavān’s head
Venerable Ānanda then rose from his seat
draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee
Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Bhagavān
In the rhythm of verse, he requested an explanation of the meaning of this from the Bhagavān
“Your figure is lovely and worthy to behold
Gracefully adorned with marks and signs most fine
And shining beautifully within a circle of lights
Please explain your smile to me
“You are engaged in exemplary conduct with superior discipline, And with the light of wisdom gathered from absorption and insight
And the strength of the essence of liberation, you see perfectly
Please explain your smile to me
“With the strength of the power of acceptanc
And diligence eminently superior and unwavering
You are pleasing to the eye and behold the four truths
Please explain your smile to me
“You have a vajra body, hard, stable, and indestructible
As mighty as Nārāyaṇa—even greater than Nārāyaṇa
Your voice is gentle, the sweet voice of Brahmā
Please explain your smile to me
“Brahmā and likewise the other gods who have gathere
Behold you with reverence, yet even though the Tathāgata is seated They cannot see the summit of your crown
Please explain your smile to me
“You turn the sacred wheel of Dharma
The message of impermanence deeply moves Gods, asuras, nāgas, and yakṣas alike
Please explain your smile to me
“You have discovered radiance and removed all darkness
You abide in equanimity with eyes that take in all
Possess superior qualities, and display essential qualities
Please explain your smile to me!
With those words he made his request
The Bhagavān then answered the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, do you see the child Inconceivable Radiance hovering in the space above, at the height of seven palm trees?
Ānanda replied, “Yes, Bhagavān, I do see him.
The Bhagavān said
“Ānanda, this bodhisattva mahāsattva Inconceivable Radiance, after one hundred incalculable eons, in the eon called Universal Illumination, in the realm known as Fully Cleansed, will make his appearance in the world as the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha
the one with knowledge and good conduct, the blissful one, the knower of the world, the charioteer who tames beings, the unexcelled, the teacher of gods and humans known precisely as the blessed buddha Inconceivable Radiance
“Ānanda, that realm Fully Cleansed will become utterly pure in the following way
as a comparison, it will be like what is enjoyed and experienced by the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods
That tathāgata will remain there for twenty intermediate eons
He will have a saṅgha of eighty thousand listeners
There will be a bodhisattva saṅgha of thirty-two thousand
“Ānanda, you may wonder why that realm will be called Fully Cleansed and the eon Universal Illumination
Ānanda, over the course of hundreds and thousands of prior intermediate eons, no tathāgata ever appears in that buddhafield
It is there that Inconceivable Radiance, the Tathāgata, will appear
it is there where the Śuddhāvāsa gods say, ‘This eon lacks universal illumination. It lacks universal illumination, so may a tathāgata appear!
His appearance is due to their giving voice to this purposeful interjection.
When this statement of prophecy about the bodhisattva Inconceivable Radiance was spoken
and this account of Dharma was taught, thirty-two thousand beings, gods and humans alike, generated the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Sixty bodhisattvas developed acceptance of the fact that phenomena do not arise
Five hundred listeners completely freed their minds from defilement, without any further grasping
The Bhagavān then said to venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, you must retain my sacred Dharma
For the benefit of present bodhisattvas, and for those yet to come, you must retain this account of Dharma.
Ānanda replied, “Bhagavān, when I retain this account of Dharma
what is the name of this account of Dharma
How shall it be remembered?
The Bhagavān said
“Retain it as The Cleansing of the Obscurations of Karma and The Buddha’s Pageantry and The Teaching by Inconceivable Radiance
“Ānanda, some people may spend their entire lives respecting, revering, venerating, and worshiping all the tathāgatas, offering them ground floral incense strewn as high as Mount Meru, as well as fragrances, powders, balms, robes, parasols, victory banners, and pennants, and also many other varieties of divine and human offerings
Compared to them, a noble son or daughter who retains and reads this account of Dharma taught by Inconceivable Radiance, who fully comprehends it and makes it widely and perfectly known to others
and who likewise assiduously applies it—such a person generates a vastly greater collection of merit
“Ānanda, since that is the case, those who wish to honor the Tathāgata with the offering of Dharma an
those who wish to create the great radiance of insight should retain this account of Dharma
read it, accomplish it with diligence, and make it widely and perfectly known to others.
When the Bhagavān had spoken these words
the venerable Ānanda, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Inconceivable Radiance
the king of Kośala, Prasenajit, along with his entourage
the lord of gods Śakra, the master of the Sahā world system Brahmā, and the four guardians of the world
along with everyone else in attendance as well as the gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas of this world, rejoiced an
greatly extolled what the Bhagavān had said
This completes the noble account of Dharma, “The Teaching by the Child Inconceivable Radiance.

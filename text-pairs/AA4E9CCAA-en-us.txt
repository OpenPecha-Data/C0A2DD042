The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra The Dwelling Place of Mañjuśr
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Bhagavān was staying at Rājagṛha, on Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, together with a large community of a full five hundred monks and a great congregation of bodhisattvas
At that time, the Bhagavān, after emerging in the late afternoon from secluded meditation, surrounded and honored by a great assembly, taught the Dharma
Subsequently, the youthful Mañjuśrī was walking about, going from residence to residence among all five hundred monks
When he went to the residence where the elder Śāriputra lived, Mañjuśrī saw him sitting alone in solitude, practicing concentration while in meditative seclusion
When he saw him, he said the following words to the elder Śāriputra
“Honorable Śāriputra, are you practicing concentration?
“Yes,” replied Śāriputra, “it is so, Mañjuśrī.
“Honorable Śāriputra,” said Mañjuśrī, “are you concentrating in order to abandon afflictions that have already been abandoned
Or are you concentrating in order to abandon those that have not yet been abandoned
“Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on the past
Are you concentrating while dwelling on the future
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on the present
Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on bodily form
Are you concentrating while dwelling on feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, or consciousness
Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on the eye
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on the nose, ear, tongue, body, or mind
Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on visible form
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on sound, smell, taste, touch, or other phenomena
“Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on the desire realm
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on the form realm or the formless realm
“Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on the internal
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on the external
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on the internal and external
Honorable Śāriputra, are you concentrating while dwelling on the body
Or are you concentrating while dwelling on the mind?
“Mañjuśrī,” replied Śāriputra, “I am practicing concentration in order to dwell in bliss for this life and to dwell in nonforgetfulness.
Mañjuśrī then asked, “Honorable Śāriputra, do you apprehend any dharmas that dwell in bliss in this life, o
that dwell in bliss in what is not this life, o
that are without forgetfulness?
“Mañjuśrī,” Śāriputra replied, “I truly do not observe or apprehend any dharmas that dwell in bliss in this life or that dwell in bliss in what is not this life
However, Mañjuśrī, I rely and dwell on what the Tathāgata taught to śrāvakas as the doctrine of disengagement.
Mañjuśrī then asked, “Honorable Śāriputra, what is it that the Tathāgata taught to śrāvakas as the doctrine of disengagement and that you, honorable Śāriputra, rely and dwell on?
Śāriputra replied, “In this regard, Mañjuśrī, a monk relies and dwells on the past
relies and dwells on the future, an
relies and dwells on the present
In brief, as mentioned before, one should understand that he relies and dwells as mentioned before all the way up to the mind
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata taught these śrāvakas that these dharmas are disengaged, an
I rely and dwell on these dharmas.
Mañjuśrī then asked, “Honorable Śāriputra, why do you say, ‘I rely and dwell on the past
rely and dwell on the future
rely on the present, dwell in disengagement, and
in brief, rely on and dwell in disengagement as mentioned before all the way up to the mind’
It is like this, honorable Śāriputra
a true nature of the past does not exist
A true nature of the future does not exist
A true nature of the present does not exist
In this way, if these dharmas do not exist, then how can the elder Śāriputra say, ‘I rely and dwell on the past
rely and dwell on the future
and rely and dwell on the present’
Dharmas that do not exist have no basis
“Further, honorable Śāriputra, there is nothing that is a true nature of the past and a true nature of the future and the present
Nor are phenomena caused by anything
Nor do they belong to anything
They are not based anywhere
There is nothing apprehended as a basis of what is not based anywhere
“Further, honorable Śāriputra, those who speak of a ‘true nature of the past, the future, and the present’ and who thus propound stability deprecate the Tathāgata
Why is this
It is because a true nature is immovable and without vain imaginings
It is because a true nature is uncorrupted
It is because true nature is empty, without signs, and wishless
“Further, honorable Śāriputra, a true nature of the past cannot be apprehended
A true nature of the future cannot be apprehended
A true nature of the present cannot be apprehended. And
in brief, the true nature of everything up to mind cannot be apprehended
However, honorable Śāriputra, besides the true nature, one does not apprehend any other dharma capable of being shown or explained.
Śāriputra then asked, “Mañjuśrī, does the Tathāgata teach the Dharma while residing in the true nature?
“Honorable Śāriputra,” Mañjuśrī replied, “if a true nature does not exist, then how can the Tathāgata reside in the true nature and teach the Dharma
Honorable Śāriputra, if the Dharma also does not exist, then how can the Tathāgata reside in the true nature and teach the Dharma
If the Tathāgata also does not exist, then how can the Tathāgata reside in the true nature and teach the Dharma
All dharmas do not exist and cannot be apprehended
The Tathāgata also does not exist and cannot be apprehended
When his Dharma is taught, it is like this
it is without distinction between either apprehending or not apprehending
The Tathāgata himself is not distinguished by the expressible or the inexpressible
Why is this
Because, honorable Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is completely cut off from expression, involves no designation, and is not something that can be designated.
Śāriputra then asked, “Mañjuśrī, who will become a recipient for a Dharma teaching such as this?
Mañjuśrī said, “Honorable Śāriputra, one who is not disturbed in the conditioned realm and who does not desire complete nirvāṇa will be a recipient for a Dharma teaching like this
One who does not apprehend dharmas of the past, does not comprehend dharmas of the past
does not apprehend dharmas of the past, present, or future, an
does not comprehend dharmas of the past, present, or future will be a recipient for a Dharma teaching such as this
One who neither sees nor appropriates defilements and purifications will be a recipient for a Dharma teaching such as this
One who does not pursue either self or nonself and who does not pursue acquiring and relinquishing is a recipient for a Dharma teaching such as this
That one will comprehend the meaning of this exposition.
“Mañjuśrī, in this regard, what is comprehended?” asked Śāriputra
Mañjuśrī then asked, “Honorable Śāriputra, if there were to be something that constitutes the meaning of this exposition, then ask, ‘In this regard, what is comprehended?’ 
“Mañjuśrī, this profound Dharma teaching is rarely directly perceived,” said Śāriputra
“It is rarely fully apprehended
Mañjuśrī, if even arhats, those in training, and those beyond training grow discouraged regarding this location, how much more so are childish ordinary beings.
“Honorable Śāriputra,” said Mañjuśrī, “arhats do not have a dwelling place
Why is this
Because if even arhats do not exist, in what place would an arhat dwell
Arhats are thus distinguished by being without dwelling place
Arhats are distinguished by being without apprehension
Arhats are distinguished by having fully cut off the expressible and inexpressible
Why is this
Because as arhats have fully cut off the expressible and inexpressible, they are free from designation
Arhats are free from distinctions concerning places
“They are distinguished by the unconditioned
They are without engagement
They are distinguished by the unconditioned because if arhats are unconditioned and without dwelling place, what would be the dwelling place of arhats
“Arhats are not distinguished by name and form
Childish ordinary beings conceptualize name and form
Name and form are understood by arhats to be without conceptions and without conceptualizing
Therefore, arhats are not distinguished by name and form
Even childish beings are not apprehended
The qualities of childish beings, arhats, and arhat qualities are also not apprehended
At the time they are not apprehended, they are not conceived
They are not dealt with
Without being dealt with, they are unelaborated and peaceful
“One does not accept their ‘existence,’ nor does one accept their ‘nonexistence.
One also does not accept that they are both existent while existing and nonexistent while not existing
Nor does one accept that they are neither existent nor nonexistent
When one does not accept any of these, there is no apprehension
Being free from all apprehensions—without thought and free from thought
we speak of one who dwells in the quality of spiritual practice by way of being without dwelling place.
Once this teaching had been explained by the youthful Mañjuśrī, the five hundred monks of the retinue got up from their seats saying, “We do not see the youthful Mañjuśrī
We do not hear the youthful Mañjuśrī
Any location where the youthful Mañjuśrī could dwell should be abandoned
Why is that
The youthful Mañjuśrī has shown in a blatant manner that the defilements and purifications have a single characteristic.” They thought that he had thereby said something that was not Dharma, an
thinking, “How can we thus train in the doctrine that is well spoken by the Bhagavān and practice pure moral conduct?” they departed
The elder Śāriputra then asked the youthful Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, do you not teach the Dharma so that sentient beings may comprehend the Dharma?
Mañjuśrī replied, “Yes, Honorable Śāriputra.
Śāriputra said, “Having arisen from their seats, those five hundred monks have spoken disparagingly and unpleasantly, and they have departed.
“Honorable Śāriputra, [it is good,]” said Mañjuśrī, “[it is good] that those five hundred monks said, ‘We do not see the youthful Mañjuśrī
We do not hear the youthful Mañjuśrī
Any location where youthful Mañjuśrī could dwell should be abandoned
[“Honorable Śāriputra,] it is good,” [said Mañjuśrī,] “it is goo
Śāriputra, the words of these monks are well spoken
Why is that
Because the youthful Mañjuśrī does not exist and cannot be apprehended
That which does not exist and cannot be apprehended cannot be seen and cannot be heard
Any location where the youthful Mañjuśrī could dwell should be abandoned
Why is that
Because, since the youthful Mañjuśrī does not exist and cannot be apprehended, any place he could dwell also does not exist and cannot be apprehended
And one should not try to rely on what does not exist and cannot be apprehended.
When those five hundred monks had heard this teaching by the youthful Mañjuśrī, they again returned to their places and said the following words to the youthful Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, why do we not understand what you just taught?
Mañjuśrī replied, “This is good, monks, this is good
Such are the activities of the Teacher’s hearers
In this regard, monks, there is nothing to comprehend and there is nothing to cognize
Why is this
Because this realm of reality is the very state of dwelling in the manner of being without dwelling place
That which is the realm of reality is not a realm
That which does not exist and cannot be apprehended is also immovable and without death and rebirth
That which is immovable and without death and rebirth is not something comprehensible
It is not something cognizable
Those who are without the vain imaginings of comprehension and cognition are called hearers of the Teacher
They are called those who have attained the supreme, leaders, and those worthy of offerings.
Upon explaining this teaching, among the five hundred monks the minds of four hundred monks were liberated from the pollutions without any further clinging
The minds of one hundred monks grew increasingly disturbed, and their bodily existences and mental states were plunged into the great hell of Howling
Venerable Śāriputra then said to the youthful Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, I am shocked that one hundred monks have all gone to ruin because you did not teach a Dharma that protects sentient beings.
Thereupon the Bhagavān replied to the elder Śāriputra
“Śāriputra, do not say such things
Why
Śāriputra, those one hundred monks will come into contact with the great hell of Howling for only a moment, and they will then take rebirth together among the gods of Tuṣita heaven
Śāriputra, if these monks had not heard this Dharma discourse, they would undoubtedly have gone to hell, an
having exhausted their karma, some would have taken rebirth as humans
But since they have relied upon this Dharma discourse, even those deeds that would cause other beings to experience hell for an eon will, for them, cause that experience for only a short while
Therefore, Śāriputra, those one hundred monks will be included among the initial hearers of the tathāgata Maitreya and become arhats who have exhausted their pollutions
Since that is so, Śāriputra, for this Dharma discourse to be heard by those who have doubt is excellent indeed
in a way that is not the case for the attainment of the four meditative concentrations
in a way that is not the case for the four immeasurables, an
in a way that is not the case for the cultivation of the four formless attainments
Why is that
Because without hearing such a Dharma discourse, one will not be liberated from cyclic existence
nor will one be liberated from birth, ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, sadness, and agitation.
The venerable Śāriputra then said to the youthful Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, it is amazing how you have matured sentient beings through your eloquent explanation of this Dharma discourse.
“Honorable Śāriputra,” replied Mañjuśrī, “the true nature does not diminish, nor does it increase
The realm of reality does not diminish , nor does it increase
The realm of sentient beings does not diminish, nor does it increase
They are not defiled, nor are they purified
Why is this
Because these things do not exist and cannot be apprehended
They are nothing at all, as they amount to nothing but mere conventions
They are not caused by anything at all
They do not dwell anywhere at all and are without dwelling place
Honorable Śāriputra, that which is uncurtailed in this way is awakening
Awakening is liberation
Liberation is nonconceptual
The nonconceptual is unfabricated and immutable
The unfabricated and immutable is wholly beyond suffering.
Thereupon, the Bhagavān said to the elder Śāriputra
“Śāriputra, it is just as the youthful Mañjuśrī has taught
True nature does not diminish, nor does it increase
The realm of reality also does not diminish, nor does it increase
The realm of sentient beings does not diminish, nor does it increase
It is not defiled, nor is it purified
Why is this
Because these things do not exist and cannot be apprehended. They are nothing at all, as they amount to nothing more than mere conventions
They are not caused by anything at all
They do not dwell anywhere at all and are without dwelling place.
At that time, the Bhagavān uttered these verses
“We speak of dharmas Of the past, present, and future
They are actually not so, for these are mere conventions
They do not have the characteristics of being one or many.
“What is conceptualized as being without characteristic
Will itself become a characteristic
What is without characteristics is nonconceptual
Conceptuality is not a characteristic either.
“That which is conceptualized as conditione
And that which is conceptualized as nirvāṇ
As the workings of Māra.
Are both explained by the wis
“All of the aggregates, sensory media, and element
Are formulated by name
The names and the unproduce
Are both of a single characteristic.
“What is properly conceptualize
Is itself not proper
The wise do not conceptualize even a little bit
Their sphere of activity is actually empty.
“Those who conceptualize waver about
Those who do not conceptualize are unwavering
Concepts produce wavering
Being without concepts is nirvāṇa.
“Those who understand this natur
Are known as wisdom bearers
On that account they have attained cessation
That is nonconceptual wisdom.
“With wisdom is wisdom proclaimed
Even proclamations of wisdom are vain
Those who have acceptance via such wisdo
Are known as wisdom bearers.
Of filling the trichiliocosms with jewels as offerings.
Superior to the generosit
“The acceptance by which one accepts a holy Dharma of this sor
Is the supreme acceptanc
“Practicing, for incalculable millions of eons
Giving, morality, forbearance
Diligent effort, and concentratio
Is not equal to this sūtra.
“This Dharma and this vehicle Were taught by the perfectly complete Buddha
When relying on this sūtr
All will become tathāgatas.”
When this Dharma discourse had been explained, one hundred thousand living beings purified the Dharma eye with regard to dharmas so that it was dustless and stainless
The minds of five hundred monks were liberated from the pollutions without any further clinging
Eighty thousand gods belonging to the form realm generated the mind set on unexcelled, perfectly complete awakening
[The Bhagavān predicted] that they would all realize unexcelled, perfectly complete awakening in the eon called Star-like an
that all of them would then bear the same name: the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Flower
The Bhagavān predicte
When the Bhagavān had said this
the youthful Mañjuśrī, the venerable Śāriputra, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the proclamation of the Bhagavān
This concludes The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra “The Dwelling Place of Mañjuśrī.

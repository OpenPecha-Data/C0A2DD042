Prayer to Orgyen Rinpoche 1
Unique embodiment of all the knowledge, love and capacity
Of the victors and their heirs in the ten directions and three times,
Single refuge for this Land of Snows, precious Guru of Oḍḍiyāna,
This child, whose karma is so wicked, calls out to you in prayer.
Kyema! Kyehü! Guru Rinpoche,
Look down from the space of wisdom at saṃsāra’s mire.
I, an unfortunate wrongdoer with evil karma,
Have fallen into the predicament of this degenerate age.
So overpowered by indifference and indolence am I
That life passes me by as I contemplate Dharma practice.
Kyema! Kyema! The phenomena of saṃsāra are transient,
And there is no end to the affairs of this life.
Given that saṃsāra is just like a pit of flames,
Inspire me to develop a sincere wish to escape.
To you I pray, O precious Guru.
With the hook of your compassion, Guru Rinpoche,
Draw me and others swiftly out of saṃsāra,
And lead us to the realm of Lotus Light.
Inspire me to follow a genuine guru whom I delight in the three ways, 2
To receive the nectar of Dharma—sūtra, tantra and pith instructions,
And unwaveringly carry out the practices of awakening.
Mahāguru Dorje Drakpo Tsal, 'Powerful Vajra Wrath',
Unleash the full force of your compassionate might,
Liberate outer, inner and secret obstacles into space,
And, Lord of Oḍḍiyāna, grant attainments, ordinary and supreme!
Help me to remain in isolated mountain retreats,
Complete the practice of the profound and secret path,
Actualize within this very lifetime
The Lotus Born of basic space, the primordial protector Samantabhadra,
Attain the vajra kāya, the immaculate rainbow body,
And constantly accomplish others’ welfare
For as long as saṃsāra itself endures.

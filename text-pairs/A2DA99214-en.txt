Thus have I heard, at one time
the Bhagavat was dwelling on the Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājgir, on a summit of infinite gems, in the Womb of Dharmadhātu Palace
together with a great assembly of twenty-five thousand monks. All of them were arhats who had exhausted their outflows
They were without afflictions and controlled
Their minds were perfectly liberated
and their wisdom was perfectly free
They were knowledgeable great elephants who had accomplished what needed to be done
They had laid down their burden and fulfilled their own benefit
They had destroyed the bonds of existence and
thanks to their correct knowledge, their minds were perfectly liberated
youthful Mañjuśrī
Dhanaśrī
Buddhiśrī
Bhaiṣajyarāja, an
Bhaiṣajya­samudgata
All of them were turning the Dharma wheel that does not turn back
They were skilled in inquiring about the vaipulya sūtras of the Heap of Jewels an
and had obtained the level called Cloud of Dharma
In terms of wisdom, they were like Sumeru
and all of them had thoroughly cultivated the dharmas of emptiness, no sign, no wish, no arising, no birth, and no existence
The greatly profound Dharma appeared to them 
and they had the postures of the tathāgatas
In other world spheres, they had been sent out by quintillions of tathāgatas
All of them were fully clairvoyant and well settled in the essential nature of all dharmas
At that time
the Bhagavat thought, “To generate great swiftness, strength, impetus, and stamina in the bodhisattva great beings
I shall give a Dharma discourse
From as many world spheres as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges
I shall cause splendorous bodhisattva great beings to assemble
Hence, I will display a sign to show that there is to be a great teaching of the Dharma
I shall cause a great light, so that bodhisattva great beings shall come to me and ask for a great Dharma teaching.
the Bhagavat illuminated the ten directions with great clouds of light rays that shone in as many worlds as there are atoms of dust in the great trichiliocosm—an uncountable and inconceivable number
as many bodhisattva great beings as there are atoms of dust in ten ineffable quintillion buddhafields approached him from all the ten directions
present with the Bhagavat were seventy-two quintillion bodhisattvas
each and every bodhisattva great being arrived with exceptional feats beyond imagination
They first performed a fitting, inconceivable worship of the Bhagavat
and then sat down in front of him on lotus seats that appeared through the force of their aspirations
They stayed still, looking at the Bhagavat without blinking
A lion throne within a great, jeweled lotus then appeared at the center of the Womb of Dharmadhātu Palace. It was an uncountable number of leagues in width, and of unprecedented height
It was made of gems and jewels sparkling in every way
with lightning for lamps, and a surrounding railing made of gems and jewels
Its staffs were of gems and jewels of inconceivable brilliance
and incomparable gems and jewels enclosed it
Jewel garlands splendid beyond comparison beautified the throne
studded with many types of precious gems
It was hung about with raised parasols, standards, and flags
From above the lion throne within the great lotus of gems and jewels, ten innumerable quintillions of light rays now issued fort
in all directions and illumined the very many world spheres in the ten directions by their great brightness
And at that very time, from each and every one of the ten directions, gods
nāgas
yakṣas
gandharvas
demigods
garuḍa
kinnaras
great serpents
śakras
brahmās
and world protectors arrived, as many as there are atoms of dust in the ineffable quintillion buddhafields
Some of them arrived together with a quintillion apsaras, uncountable and beyond conception, singing and playing musical instruments while they sat in jeweled palaces
Some arrived with palaces that were made of flowers
others with palaces were made of heaps of uragasāra sandalwood
Some palaces were made of pearls, others of diamonds
and others still of gems and jewels that shone like diamonds
Some were made of gold from the river Jāmbū
and others were built with gems that shone in all colors
Some were made of the vaśirāja gem and others of wish-fulfilling jewels
Still other palaces were made of those gems worn by Śakra
Yet others arrived with uncountable, inconceivable quadrillions of apsaras, singing and playing musical instruments while they sat in palaces of great jewels, gems beaming uninterruptedly from the array of pure, ocean-ground jewels
As they arrived, they first worshipped the Bhagavat in an inconceivable, matchless, immeasurable, and limitless manner
Then they arranged themselves on one side, on seats that manifested through their own aspirations
they stayed still, looking at the Bhagavat without blinking
At that very moment this world sphere, a great trichiliocosm, turned into Jāmbū River gold
It was adorned with trees of many great gems and jewels
divine flowering trees
trees of fine fabrics
It was covered with a net of precious moon gems, sun gems, and vidyutpradīpa gems
Parasols, standards, and flags were hoisted
nnumerable quintillions of apsaras with half their bodies in sight thronged all trees, which were enveloped by strings of pearls and garlands of great precious jewels
At that time these verses rang out from the lion throne with its great, jeweled lotus inside
I came about by the force of your merit
“Come, be seated, king of the best among men
Victor, best among the two-footed
Fulfilling my wish, today I shall support you
“My body is made of jewels
Oh Guide, for your sake, At my center is a beautiful jewel lotus
Protector, please fulfill my wish today
“Seated on this jewel lotus
You shall beautify this entire world and me
Hearing such Dharma, one obtains a lion throne like this
You shall teach the Dharma to many millions of living beings
“Thousands of light rays shining from your limbs Illuminate many world spheres
This is the sign of someone in whom joy is born
Guide, ascend to me
In the past, in this very place, I have supported eighty million self-arisen sages
“Quickly, take your seat and grant your favor
May the Bhagavat also, today, bestow his favor!
At this the Bhagavat arose from his previous seat an
sat down on the lion throne with its great jewel lotus inside. He sat with his legs crossed and observed the entire gathering of bodhisattvas
Then, to those bodhisattva great beings, he signaled that he was about to deliver a distinguished Dharma teaching
At that very time, the entire assembly of bodhisattvas had the thought
“The youthful Mañjuśrī should now inquire of the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha, about non-arising and non-cessation. We have not heard that Dharma teaching for a long time.
The youthful Mañjuśrī had understood the Bhagavat’s signal
and he also knew what the bodhisattva great beings were thinking
So he arose and adjusted his upper robe so that one shoulder was uncovered
He then knelt in front of the Bhagavat with his right knee placed in the center of a lotus
With joined palms he then addressed this question to the Bhagavat
“Bhagavat, ‘non-arising’ and ‘non-cessation’ have been spoken of
Bhagavat, to what dharma do the terms ‘non-arising’ and ‘non-cessation’ refer?
He also expressed his question in verse
Of ‘non-cessation’ and ‘non-arising.
“Guide, you spea
Greatly wise one, How do you explain those terms
“ ‘Non-cessation’ and ‘non-arising,
Why are they called so
Through analogies and reasons
Great sage, please tell u
“These many bodhisattvas have come here
Wishing for awareness; They were sent to salute you
by many guides of the world
So please teach the lofty and excellent, good Dharma!
the Bhagavat said to the youthful Mañjuśrī
You are striving for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, and with compassion for the world
You are doing so for the goodness, benefit, and happiness of a great group of beings, both gods and men
You are also acting so that the bodhisattva great beings who have come here may obtain the level of a buddha
“Good, Mañjuśrī, good
Mañjuśrī, it is good that you think to ask the Tathāgata about this matter
you should apply yourself to this point without alarm, without fear, and without hesitation
And, Mañjuśrī, you must rely on awareness
“It is as follows. Mañjuśrī, imagine that this wide earth were made entirely of beryl
so that in that beryl one could see reflections of the abode of the Thirty-Three; of Śakra, lord of the gods; and of his Palace of Victory
And imagine that Śakra, lord of the gods, could be seen there, playing and enjoying himself with the five divine objects of pleasure
“At that time, the gods might call out to all the men, women, boys, and girls of Jambūdvīpa
‘Come here, men and women
Look at Śakra, lord of the gods, as he is playing, enjoying, and amusing himself with the five divine objects of pleasure in his Palace of Victory
Come, all men and women
offer gifts and make merits
Take up discipline and abide by it
hen you shall also get to play, enjoy, and amuse yourself in such Palaces of Victory
You will become like Śakra himself and will come to possess wealth like his. The lord of the gods, Śakra, has all divine enjoyments, and so shall you.
“Then, Mañjuśrī, all those men, women, girls, and boys, who could see the abode of the Thirty-Three along with Śakra, lord of the gods, and his Palace of Victory reflected in the wide earth of beryl
would fold their hands toward this reflection. They would scatter flowers and offer perfumes toward it, saying
‘May we also obtain such a body as that of Śakra, lord of the gods
may we also play, enjoy, and amuse ourselves in the Palace of Victory, just like Śakra, lord of the gods.
“However, those beings would not understand that this would merely be a reflection in the wide earth of beryl, a reflection occurring due to the complete purity of the beryl, wherein the abode of the Thirty-Three, along with Śakra, lord of the gods, and his Palace of Victory, could be seen
Wishing for the state of Śakra, they would then offer gifts and make merits
They would take up discipline and abide by that. They would then dedicate the roots of what is wholesome toward birth in that reflection of the abode of the Thirty-Three
“Mañjuśrī, in that wide earth of beryl there would, of course, be no abode of the Thirty-Three, and neither would there be a Palace of Victory, or Śakra, lord of the gods
However, due to the purity of the great beryl
the abode of the Thirty-Three along with the Palace of Victory and Śakra, lord of the gods would all be visible
Non-existent, non-arisen, and non-ceased, their reflections would be seen because of the purity of the great beryl
“In the same way, Mañjuśrī, it is due to the complete purity of the mind, as well as due to proper cultivation, that sentient beings see the body of a tathāgata
Mañjuśrī, it is due to the power of the Tathāgata that sentient beings see him
And still he remains non-existent, non-arisen, and non-ceased
He is neither existence nor non-existence
neither visible nor invisible
neither worldly nor unworldly
neither an object of thinking nor not an object of thinking
neither existent nor non-existent
“It is so, Mañjuśrī, that sentient beings focus on the reflection of the Tathāgat
and offer it flowers, perfumes, garments, and jewels while making this aspiration
‘May we also become like the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha.
Wishing for a buddha’s awareness
they offer gifts and make merit
They take up discipline and abide by it
Then they dedicate that root of what is wholesome toward obtaining a tathāgata’s awareness
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
the reflection of Śakra, ruler of the gods, on that wide earth made of beryl does not move
Nor does he think, elaborate, construct, or conceptualize
It is not a construct, not a concept, inconceivable, and not a mental placement
He is peaceful and cool, non-arising and non-cessation
not seen, not heard, not smelt, not tasted, not touched
not a sign, not a cognition, and not something that can be made known
“In the same way, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha does not move
He is not a construct, not a concept, inconceivable, not a mental placement
“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is in the realm of non-arising
On the other hand, he appears in the world as a reflected image
According to the beliefs of sentient beings he displays diverse appearances and diverse lifespans
He appears among sentient beings who have become fitting receptacles for awakening thanks to their maturation and belief
These sentient beings then hear the Dharma according to their dispositions and beliefs
According to their dispositions they understand the three vehicle
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
a great Dharma drum for making sounds of Dharma, which come about through the force of merit of the gods of the Thirty-Three
is placed in the atmosphere above the Vaijayanta Palace
beyond visible range. The divine scions cannot see it or behold it
“However, Mañjuśrī, it is a great Dharma drum
Sometimes the gods in the heaven of the Thirty-Three become so intensely and continuously oblivious from playing with, enjoying, and delighting themselves with their divine pleasure
that they fail to enter the divine hall called Sudharma to jointly chant the Dharma
And, Mañjuśrī, Śakra, lord of the gods, becomes so intensely and continuously oblivious from playing with, enjoying, and delighting himself with his divine pleasure
that he fails to sit on his Dharma seat to speak of the Dharma
“Mañjuśrī, at such times, that great Dharma drum
not to be seen or beheld, hanging in the atmosphere beyond visible range
plays a Dharma sound that addresses all the gods in the heaven of the Thirty-Three
‘Friends! Form, sound, smell, flavor, and touch are impermanent
do not be careless
Do not quickly fall down from this abode
Friends, all co-producing factors are suffering
Friends, all co-producing factors are empty
Friends, all co-producing factors are without self
for those who die and fall from here, to take birth here once again is difficult
Do not become careless
delight in the pleasant joy of Dharma
being inclined toward the Dharma
with Dharma pouring like rain, recollecting and placing the Dharma in the mind
You shall not then have to part from these divine enjoyments and delights in games of pleasure.
“At that time, Mañjuśrī, due to the sound of that great Dharma drum
invisible, formless, inconceivable, not a mental construct
out of sight
unborn, unceasing, beyond the way of words
and devoid of mind, mentality, and consciousnes
—all the gods in the heaven of the Thirty-Three are roused, scared, alarmed, and very distressed
They enter the divine hall called Sudharm
delighting in the pleasant joy of Dharma
They make the Dharma their essence
they become inclined toward the Dharma
recollecting and keeping the Dharma in mind
When they die and fall from that abode, they will again reach excellent places
Śakra, the king of the gods, then enters Sudharma, the divine hall
takes a seat on the Dharma throne, and teaches the Dharma
“Mañjuśrī, when the demigods battle against the gods
whenever the gods of the heaven of the Thirty-Three are being defeated
the Dharma drum emits a sound that makes the demigods so frightened, alarmed, agitated, and distressed that they flee
Nevertheless, Mañjuśrī, that great Dharma drum does not have a producer
nor does it have a body
Mañjuśrī, that Dharma drum is invisible
not to be beheld, not true
not real, with no mind, without intention
sign-less
voiceless
immaterial
non-dual
and out of sight
“Nevertheless, Mañjuśrī, for those gods in the heaven of the Thirty-Three who have previously purified themselves
a sound comes forth from the great Dharma drum
It occurs to pacify all the misfortunes, troubles, and afflictions of the gods of the Thirty-Three
“Mañjuśrī, in the same way that from that great Dharma drum
invisible
not to be beheld
not true, not real, with no mind, without intention
sign-less
formless
voiceless, immaterial
non-dual
and out of sigh
that sound of Dharma occurs to pacify all the misfortunes, troubles, and afflictions of the gods of the Thirty-Three
so, too, Mañjuśrī, although the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha is invisible
not true, not real
with no mind, without intention
and out of sight, nevertheless
Mañjuśrī, sentient beings perceive the voice of Dharma due to the maturation of previous karma, according to their individual aspirations and interests
And that sound of Dharma occurs to pacify all misfortunes, troubles, and afflictions of all sentient beings
Being the voice of Dharma, it is regarded in the world as the voice of the Tathāgata
“Mañjuśrī, there is no Tathāgata
However, the designation ‘Tathāgata’ comes about in the world because of the voice of Dharma
It is exclusively due to the maturation of sentient beings’ previous wholesome karm
that they perceive the voice of the Tathāgata
That voice emerges in order to produce happiness for all sentient beings and to prompt those who are careless
Mañjuśrī, as those sentient beings hear that sound
they form the concept of a tathāgata, thinking, ‘This is the Tathāgata’s body.
“The speech of the Tathāgata is heard so that beginner bodhisattvas and all immature, ordinary people may generate roots of what is wholesome by taking the Tathāgata as their reference point
However, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata should be known to be non-arisen and non-ceasing
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
at the end of summertime, during the first month of rains
due to the maturation of sentient beings’ previous karma
and to generate, out of the multitudes of seeds and elements, all the grass, thickets, medicinal herbs, and trees on earth
winds begin to blow in the atmosphere and the sky above
then water comes about due to that wind, and it falls on the great earth
Thus, the great earth is satisfied
and all sentient beings in Jambūdvīpa are joyful and happy
Referring to this, the notion of a ‘cloud’ comes about in the world
“Mañjuśrī, whenever not much rain falls from the atmosphere and the sky above
all the sentient beings in Jambūdvīpa think, ‘Here there is not a cloud.
But when, Mañjuśrī, a lot of rain falls on the great earth from the atmosphere and the sky above
they say: ‘Oh, a great cloud is pouring down water
satisfying the great earth.
“However, Mañjuśrī, when this happens there is neither a cloud, nor anything that can be designated as a cloud
a large mass of water is generated by the wind, and then it falls from the atmosphere above
disappears in the atmosphere itself
“Mañjuśrī, that cumulus of water above in the atmosphere, stirred by the wind and releasing water, is designated a cloud due to the maturation of sentient beings’ previous karma
Mañjuśrī, no cloud can be found there
nor anything that could be designated a cloud
Mañjuśrī, the cloud is non-arisen and non-ceasing
it does not enter the way of mind, and it is free from coming and going
“In the same way, Mañjuśrī, for bodhisattva great beings who have accumulated previous roots of what is wholesome
for other sentient beings who wish for the awareness of a hearer or a pratyekabuddha
and for those sentient beings who have accumulated roots of what is wholesome and possess the causes to be shown the path to nirvāṇa
the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha with unobstructed brilliance comes to be counted as arisen in the world
“Whatever he says is thus (tathā), undistorted, thus and not otherwise. Therefore
he was given the name Tathāgata among gods and men
Mañjuśrī, this word appears among gods and men: Tathāgata
However, Mañjuśrī, there is no Tathāgata to be found
The Tathāgata, Mañjuśrī, is not a sign
and he is free from signs
He is unreal, non-arisen, and non-ceasing
“On the other hand, Mañjuśrī, the appearance of the Tathāgata satisfies and entertains this world, including the gods
And then, due to the ripening of previous karma of beginner bodhisattvas and immature, ordinary people who are guided by means of nirvāṇa
They think, ‘The Tathāgata has passed into complete nirvāṇa.
However, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata neither arises nor ceases
The Tathāgata, Mañjuśrī, is non-arisen and non-ceasing
“Mañjuśrī, when some water is taken as a point of reference for an unreal clou
that has not arisen nor ceased, and is non-existent
the designation ‘cloud’ is established in the world. In the very same way
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
every day the great and unsurpassed Brahmā, who controls ten trichiliocosms, looks upon all the classes of gods, as far as the class of the gods of the Four Great Kings
At that time, Mañjuśrī, while the great Brahmā, who controls ten trichiliocosms, looks upon all the classes of gods
they all abandon their games of pleasure, delights, and enjoyments
they respectfully fold their hand
and look toward the great Brahmā without blinking
For a moment, the great Brahmā offers sight of himself to all the classes of gods
At that time, the gods all long to be born in the world of the great Brahmā
and they dedicate their roots of what is wholesome toward taking birth in the world of the great Brahmā
“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, that great Brahmā, without falling down from that Brahmā Palace
thanks to the power of his previous aspirations and due to the prior accumulation of virtue on the part of the gods
empowers another great Brahmā as the controller of ten trichiliocosms
“Mañjuśrī, that emanated great Brahmā looks upon all the classes of gods, as far as the class of the gods of the Four Great Kings
At that time, Mañjuśrī
among all the classes of gods, all the scions of the gods abandon their games of pleasure, delights, and enjoyments
They stop playing their percussion instruments and halt their singing
Shifting their attention from their games of pleasure and delights
they respectfully fold their hands and look toward the great Brahmā without blinking
At that time, the gods all long to be born in the world of the great Brahmā, and they dedicate their roots of what is wholesome toward taking birth in the world of the great Brahmā
“Still, Mañjuśrī, no Brahmā is there to be found
Mañjuśrī, Brahmā is empty, dependent
unreal, without syllables
without voice, without place
and also not an existent thing. He is inconceivable
without signs, and free from mentality, mind, and consciousness
He is non-arisen and unceasing
And yet, Mañjuśrī, a semblance of him offering sight of himself appears among all the classes of gods, by the power of his own previous roots of what is wholesome and aspirations, and due to the previous accumulations of roots of what is wholesome on the part of those gods
“Yet, Mañjuśrī, those gods do not think, ‘This Brahmā is an emanation
empty, dependent
unreal, without syllables
without voice, without place
not an existent thing
and free from mentality, mind, and consciousness
He is non-arisen and unceasing.
“Mañjuśrī, in the same manner the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha is empty
dependent, unreal, without syllables, without voice, without place, and also not an existent thing
He is inconceivable, without signs, and free from mentality, mind, and consciousness
This is due to the power of his previous aspirations during his practice as a bodhisattva, and also due to the power of all the roots of what is wholesome of the beginner bodhisattvas, of those who set out on the vehicles of the hearers and the pratyekabuddhas, as well as of all the immature, ordinary people
He is seen in the world as a tathāgata adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks, like a reflected image; and he does not move from his place
“Yet, Mañjuśrī, from the body of the Tathāgata, adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks, during all the empty postures of a tathāgata
a great Dharma teaching emanates for the sake of varied sentient beings with diverse beliefs
“That Dharma teaching occurs to pacify all the troubles, harms, and afflictions of all sentient beings
In that regard, the Tathāgata is the same, neutral, without concepts, and does not make any distinctions
Thus, Mañjuśrī, through this explanation you should understand that ‘non-arising and non-cessation’ is an appellation of the Tathāgata.
Then, at that time, the Bhagavat spoke the following two stanzas
“The Tathāgata always has the quality of non-arising
And all dharmas resemble the Sugata
Yet immature minds, by their grasping at signs
Roam the world among non-existent dharmas
“The Tathāgata is a reflected imag
Of the wholesome Dharma without 
Yet here there is no tathatā and no Tathāgata
While an image is seen in the entire world
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
here in Jambūdvīpa the rays of the sun only shine at first on the great king of mighty mountains
After that, they shine on the Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa ranges
After that, they shine on the elevated regions of the earth
After that, they shine on the low-lying regions of the earth here in Jambūdvīpa
“Yet those sun rays, Mañjuśrī, do not form mental constructs or concepts
They do not think or ponder
The rays of the sun, Mañjuśrī, are free from mentality, mind, and consciousness
they are unborn and unceasing, without characteristics, free from characteristics
without mental placement, free from mental placement
without elaboration, free from elaboration
without torment, free from torment
not abiding hither, not abiding thither
not high, not low
not bound, not liberated
not knowing, not ignorant
not afflictions, not free from afflictions
not speaking the truth, not speaking falsely
not over there, not here
not on dry land, not in the stream
not the domain of reasoning, not the domain of non-reasoning
neither with form, nor formless
Yet, Mañjuśrī, due to the distinction of higher, middling, and lower places on the earth
the light shines differently, at higher, middling, and lower degrees causing varied shades
“In the same way, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha does not form mental constructs or concepts
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
not speaking the truth, not speaking falsely
not on the shore, nor on the non-shore
“He is not omniscient, not non-omniscient
not reasoning, not non-reasoning
not acting, not non-acting
neither mindful nor unmindful
neither with intention nor free from intention
neither mind nor without mind
neither originated nor unoriginated
neither name nor no name
neither form nor no form
neither verbal expression nor non-verbal expression
neither a possible object of imputation, nor not a possible object of imputation
neither visible nor invisible
neither a conducive way nor not a conducive way
neither leading along the way, nor not leading along the way
neither having obtained the result, nor not having obtained the result
neither a concept, nor not a concept
neither free from concepts, nor not free from concepts
“Similarly, Mañjuśrī, the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata shine brilliantly in the three realms, unimpeded throughout the dharmadhātu with neither edge nor center
Once they shine, they first descend upon the bodies of bodhisattvas, whose aspirations are like the great lord of mountains
After that, they descend upon the bodies of those who set forth on the Vehicle of Pratyekabuddhas
Then they descend upon the bodies of those who have set forth on the Hearers’ Vehicle
After that, they descend upon the body of sentient beings with wholesome aspirations, according to their specific inclinations
After that, the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata even descend upon the body of those sentient beings with mental continua that are stuck in what is wrong
The rays assist all these beings by producing causes for what will come later, and increase their wholesome dharmas
“In that respect, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is everywhere the same, neutral, without concepts, and does not make any distinctions
Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the round sun of the Tathāgata’s awareness does not think, ‘I will teach this person the vast Dharma
but I will not teach that one.’ Neither do they have the concep
‘This person has vast belief
that one has middling belief
This one has belief in the Hearers’ Vehicle
This one has wholesome aspiration
while that one is low, with wrong aspirations.’ “Mañjuśrī, the round sun of the Tathāgata’s awareness does not thin
This sentient being has vast beliefs, so I will teach him the Great Vehicle
This one has middling belief
so I will teach him the Pratyekabuddha Vehicl
This one has belief in the Hearers’ Vehicle
so I will teach him the Hearers’ Vehicle
I shall come to understand the aspirations of sentient beings with either wholesome or unwholesome aspiration
then purify the
and straighten up their view. Even for sentient beings stuck in what is wron
The light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata does not have any such concepts
And why
On the other hand, Mañjuśrī, because of variations in sentient beings’ inclinations to wholesome intent, the light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata is varied too
Because the light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata has cut off all constructs, concepts, and elaborations
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
in the great ocean there is a great, precious jewel called Fulfilling All Wishes
I shall teach a fitting dharma
Mañjuśrī, when the teaching of the Dharma is taken as a point of reference for an unreal tathāgata who has not arisen nor ceased, and who is non-existent and primordially unborn
the designation ‘the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha’ becomes established in the world
“In the very same way, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha does not form mental construct
It is inconceivable, free from what can be conceived, and free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
He does not think or ponder
He is not obtained, not obtainable
He is inconceivable, free from what can be conceived, and free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
He is non-grasping, the act of not holding on
He has eliminated arbitrary truths as well as attachment, aversion, and delusion
He is neither true nor false
neither permanent nor impermanent
neither shining nor not shining
neither worldly nor non-worldly
He is without deliberation or analysis. He is non-arisen and unceasing
“He is inconceivable, imponderable, essence-less, and not possibly an essence
He is empty of non-existence
He is not bliss
he is free from bliss
he is the destruction of bliss
When it is attached to the top of a banne
and a sentient being makes a wish, sentient beings will perceive corresponding words coming forth from the jewel. However, that great, precious jewel does not form mental constructs or concepts
He is not a conventional expression
he is the cutting off of conventional expressions
He cannot be clung to
he is free from striving or giving anything up
It does not think or ponder
He cannot be counted
he is free from counting
and has cut off all conventional expressions
he has cut off all movemen
He is not movement, he has reached non-movement
He is not space
he is ungraspable
“He cannot be seen or beholden
not lack of space
not an assemblage
and not a non-assemblage
He is neither mentally constructed nor not mentally constructed
He is not visible
not to be described
He is not established, shown, afflicted, or purified
He is not established, shown, afflicted, or purified
He is not name
not form
not sign
not karma
not the maturation of karma
He is not past
not future
not present
He is nothing whatsoever
He is without impurity
without syllables
without voice
not speech
beyond a voice
He is not a characteristic
he is free from all characteristics
not perceived inside, outside, or in between
“And Mañjuśrī, the awareness jewel of the Tathāgata is completely pure in its intent, and is fixed at the top of the banner of great compassion
According to his or her inclinations and beliefs, a sentient being perceives a Dharma teaching issuing forth from that jewel
And in this respect, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is the same, neutral, without concepts, and does not make any distinctions

“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī
it is through having the earth as their basis and support that all grass, thickets, herbs, and trees grow to become sizeable
But, Mañjuśrī, the earth does not form mental constructs or concepts
With respect to everything it is the same, free from concepts
and free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
and free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
free from distinctions
It is free from speculation

And still, Mañjuśrī, according to whether sentient beings are low, middling, or high
they see the Tathāgata as low, middling, or high
“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata does not think
‘This sentient being has low inclinations and beliefs, so I will show him a low perfection of the form body
This sentient being has middling inclinations and beliefs, so I will show him a middling perfection of the form body
This sentient being has vast inclinations and beliefs
so I will show him a vast perfection of the form body.
“Mañjuśrī, this is also what you should understand regarding how the Dharma is taught
so for him I shall make a speech relating to the Hearers’ Vehicle
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata does not think, ‘This sentient being has low beliefs

so for him I shall make a speech relating to the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle
no removal
no addition
He has no striving or giving up
so for him I shall make a speech relating to the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle
This sentient being has vast beliefs
so for him I shall make a speech relating to the Great Vehicle.
“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata does not think, ‘This sentient being has belief in giving
so for him I shall make a speech related to giving.
Nor does he think so for discipline, forbearance, diligence, or concentration
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is the dharmakāya
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is utterly non-arisen
“Mañjuśrī, for the Tathāgata, a consciousness chasing after names, forms, and etymological explanations does not occur
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata does not form mental constructs or concepts
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is momentary
“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata does not think, ‘This sentient being has belief in the perfection of wisdom, so for him I shall make a speech related to the perfection of wisdom.
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata does not think in that way
and his characteristic is to be inexhaustible
He is fixed at the pinnacle of non-exhaustion, the pinnacle of reality
Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddh
is the pinnacle of the sameness of all dharmas, the pinnacle of their non-duality, and the pinnacle of their utter non-arising
He is not low, nor middling, nor high
In all regards he is the same, free from concepts, and free from distinctions
They are not low, nor middling, nor high
It is because no dharmas are perceived
“Mañjuśrī, just in the same way, all dharmas are same free from concepts, and free from distinctions
And why is that
Mañjuśrī, this non-perception of all dharmas is their sameness
Mañjuśrī, this non-perception of all dharmas is their sameness
Their sameness is their remaining fixed
Remaining fixed means that they do not move
not moving means being without any abode
“For someone with no abode in any dharma, the mind has no place to stand
For a mind that stands nowhere, there will be non-arising
And for someone who sees in this way, no distorted mind and mental states come about
someone whose mind is undistorted will have authentic attainment
“Whoever has authentic attainment will not form elaborations
Someone who does not form elaborations does not move about
When one does not move about, one does not wander
When one does not wander, one does not become distracted
One who does not become distracted does not oppose the dharmatā
One who does not oppose the dharmatā is in conformity with everything
One who is in conformity with everything does not move from the nature of the dharmas
One who does not move from the nature of the dharmas obtains the nature of the dharmas
One who obtains the nature of the dharmas does not form any elaboration
Why is that
“Whoever is born from conditions and causes is utterly unborn
Someone utterly unborn has gained certainty
Whoever has gained certainty does not dwell with any mental engagement in the dharmas
When one does not dwell with any mental engagement in the dharmas, one does not dwell with the dharmas
When one does not dwell with the dharmas, one does not come into existence or go out of existence
When one does not come into existence or go out of existence, one becomes fixed and has obtained the Dharma
“When one becomes fixed and has obtained the Dharma, one applies oneself to the proper dharma
When one applies oneself to the proper dharma, no dharma whatsoever is not a buddhadharma
Due to the realization of emptiness
The realization of emptiness is awakening
no-sign
no-wish
no-dwelling
no-effort
“It is awakening, because in this way one realizes emptiness, no-sign, no-wish; no-effort, no-dwelling, no coming about; no object of apprehension and no-abode
Awakening is proper application
“What is called proper application is to neither remove nor add
And why
and the application of what has yet to come
This is proper application
It is the non-liberated application
and it is not connected
It is the application of not doing and not changing
the application of neither oneness nor plurality
Because mind is by nature luminous
“In that respect, there is no application
no measur
and no direct realization of a result
It is afflicted by adventitious afflictions
but its nature is not afflicted
“Luminosity by nature is non-affliction
With respect to non-affliction there is no counteragent—a counteragent by which the destruction of the afflictions may occur
Because what is pure does not become pure; it just is pure
“That which is pure is non-arising
Non-arising is faultless
What is faultless is the destruction of joys
whereby all attachments cease
Where all attachments cease, that is non-arising
And non-arising is awakening
“Awakening is sameness
Sameness is the tathatā
All dharmas, co-produced and unproduced, abide in the tathatā
there is no designation of duality
With respect to the tathatā there is neither something co-produce
Where there is nothing co-produced or unproduced, and no designation of duality, that is the tathatā
nor something unproduced
“The tathatā is nothing else but the tathatā
Nothing else but the tathatā is the unchanging tathatā
The unchanging tathatā is the non-coming tathatā
The unchanging tathatā is the non-coming tathatā
The non-coming tathatā is the tathatā that does not go
The tathatā that does not go is the authentic tathatā
The authentic tathatā is the not-at-all-tathatā
The not-at-all-tathatā is not afflicte
and is not purified
That which is neither afflicted nor purified neither arises nor ceases
That which neither arises nor ceases is the same as nirvāṇa
That which is the same as nirvāṇa neither roams within saṃsāra nor passes into complete nirvāṇa
That which neither roams within saṃsāra nor passes into complete nirvāṇa is not past, future, or present
That which is not past, future, or present is not low, middling, or high
That which is not low, middling, or high is the tathatā
“What we call tathathā is an expression meaning tattva
What we call tattva is tathatā itself
Tathatā being the same as tattva is called tathatva
Thus, the tathatā and the self are not two, they are non-dual
The meaning of non-duality is awakening, in the sense of becoming awake
The meaning is explained as the awareness that enters the three gates of liberation with respect to all the Dharma teachings
The awareness is explained as engaging in the sameness of the three times with respect to all dharmas
The meaning of the inseparability of all dharmas is what is explained as the meaning
It is voiceless
ineffable
inexpressible
and cut off from any expressions
Awareness is explained as the awareness that understands the meaning and understands consciousness
this is explained as awareness
The meaning is explained as the meaning that is established by the awareness that understands the meaning of tattva, and by the awareness that understands consciousness
That itself is the dharmatā
And the dharmatā is the meaning
Sameness is the meaning
“Mañjuśrī, for those who have attachment to form, the eye is attachment
Knowing the nature of form and of the eye is non-attachment
“For those who have attachment to views, one’s own body is attachment
For those who have done away with all views, the awareness of one’s body’s natural emptiness is non-attachment
“For those who are stuck in their attachment to improper mental placement, the appearance of dharmas is attachment
Discerning the dharmas through proper mental placement, the awareness of emptiness by nature and emptiness of essence is non-attachment
“For those who are stuck in their attachment to the stain of doubt, liberation is attachment
The authentic awareness of belief and liberation is non-attachment
“For those who are stuck in their attachment to the stain of laziness, having present diligence toward realization is attachment
The realization of dharmas as they are is non-attachment
The realization of dharmas as they are is non-attachment
“For those who are stuck in their attachment to the hindrances, the limbs of awakening are attachment
Liberation through unobstructed awareness is non-attachment
“Being by nature completely pure, all dharmas occur due to an assemblage of causes and conditions
“The sameness of the interpretable meaning and the definitive meaning is their common meaning, which is emptiness
Because he is born due to conditions and causes
The sameness of liberation is the same as the sameness of the dharmas
Realization according to the sameness of liberation is awakening
The sameness of the person is the same as the common meaning
The sameness of the dharmas is the same as the sameness of persons
It is sameness according to the understanding of the meaning; it is the sameness of awareness, entering the gate of non-duality
The non-occurrence of the dharma and the sameness of meaning and expression are the same with respect to the non-dual meaning
With respect to that, a bodhisattva should understand well the cause of affliction and the cause of purification
He should neither abide with the purity of the cause of affliction, nor with the purity of the cause of purification
“Elevating self is a cause of affliction
Forbearance in one’s engagement with the selflessness of dharmas is a cause of purification
“The view of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ is a cause of affliction
Inner pacification and outer non-movement is a cause of purification
“Thoughts of desire, ill will, and harm are a cause of affliction
emptiness
“It is awakening, because in this way one realizes emptiness, no-sign, no-wish; no-effort, no-dwelling, no coming about; no object of apprehension and no-abode
Forbearance in one’s dealings with impure things, in one’s practice of friendliness, compassion, rejoicing, equanimity, and with dependent dharmas, is a cause of purification
“The four distortions are a cause of affliction
The four placements of mindfulness are a cause of purification
“The five hindrances are a cause of affliction
The five faculties are a cause of purification
“The six entrances are a cause of affliction
The six remembrances are a cause of purification
“The seven false dharmas are a cause of affliction
The seven limbs of awakening are a cause of purification
“The eight wrong modes are a cause of affliction
The eight right modes are a cause of purification
“The nine causes of antagonism are a cause of affliction
The absorptions into nine successive abodes are a cause of purification
“The ten unwholesome courses of karma are a cause of affliction
The ten wholesome courses of karma are a cause of purification
“In brief, all unwholesome mental engagements are a cause of affliction
all wholesome mental engagements are a cause of purification
without a sentient being
without a living being
without one who nourishes
without a soul or a person
without a master
without activity
comparable to an illusion, without characteristics
pacified from within
“In that respect, whether causes of affliction or of purification, all dharmas are by nature empty
pacified from within they are utterly pacified
Utterly pacified, they are their intrinsic nature
Their intrinsic nature is not being perceived
Not being perceived is to have no abode
That which has no abode is thatness
Thatness is space
And why
One cognizes all dharmas as the same as space. One engages conventionally in the purification of afflictions, yet does not abandon the dharmatā of space
Mañjuśrī, no dharma whatsoever can be found for which there may be arising or cessation.
Mañjuśrī inquired
“How then, Bhagavat, did the Tathāgata obtain awakening?
The Bhagavat replied
“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata obtained an awakening that has no root and no ground to stand upon.
Mañjuśrī asked
Bhagavat, what root would that be
and what ground to stand upon?
“Mañjuśrī, that root would be the transitory collection
and that ground to stand upon the imagination of what is not there
Then, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata knows the sameness of all dharmas through the sameness of awakening
Therefore it is said, Mañjuśrī, that ‘the Tathāgata realized an awakening that has no root and no ground to stand upon.
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is to be at peace, utterly at peace
In that respect, what is peace
what is utter peace
Inside there is peace
outside there is utter peace
Why is that
“The eye, Mañjuśrī, is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
such is its nature. This is called peace
Thoroughly understanding that the eye is empty, one does not run toward forms
Thus it is called utter peace
“In the same way, the ear is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
Thoroughly understanding that the ear is empty, one does not run toward sounds
“The nose is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
Thoroughly understanding that the nose is empty
one does not run toward smells
“The tongue is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
Thoroughly understanding that the tongue is empty, one does not run toward flavors
“The body is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
Thoroughly understanding that the body is empty
one does not run toward touchable things
“The mind, Mañjuśrī, is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
Thoroughly understanding that the mind is empty
one does not run toward dharmas
The nature is not afflicted
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is by nature luminous, because the mind is by nature luminous; that is why it is said to be luminous by nature
it is the same as space
it has the nature of space
it goes together with space
it is comparable to space
The nature is utterly luminous
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is without striving or giving anything up
In that respect, how is it without striving
and how is it without giving anything up
Without striving means not to grasp at any dharma
Without striving means not to grasp at any dharma
Without giving anything up means not to abandon any dharma
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, without striving or giving anything up, crossed the stream
He crossed it in such a way that he does not see this shore or the other shore of tathatā
Thus he is called the Tathāgata
Therefore, the Tathāgata realized all dharmas to be free from this shore or the other shore
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is without sign or reference point
In that respect, what is signlessness, and what is the lack of reference point
“That the eye-consciousness does not perceive, Mañjuśrī, is signlessness
That form is not seen is the lack of reference point
“That the ear-consciousness does not perceive is signlessness
That sounds are not heard is the lack of reference point
“That the nose-consciousness does not perceive is signlessness
That smells are not smelt is the lack of reference point
“That the tongue-consciousness does not perceive is signlessness
“That the body-consciousness does not perceive is signlessness
That touchable things are not touched is the lack of reference point
“That the mind-consciousness does not perceive is signlessness
That dharmas are not cognized is the lack of reference point
“This, Mañjuśrī, is the scope of the noble ones
That which is not the scope of the three realms, Mañjuśrī, is the scope of the noble ones
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is not past, not future, not present
That flavors are not tasted is the lack of reference point
It is the same in the three times, and is cut off from the three spheres
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what does it mean to be cut off from the three spheres
The mind in the past is not perceived
Consciousness does not run toward the future
Consciousness does not run toward the future
Mental placement does not occur in the present
One who does not abide in mind, mentality, and consciousness does not form mental constructs or concepts
one does not elaborate about the present
Not forming mental constructs or concepts, one does not create the pas
does not think of the future
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is bodiless and unproduced
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, bodilessness is what cannot be cognized by the eye consciousness
what cannot be cognized by the ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind consciousness
Mañjuśrī, that which cannot be cognized by mind, mentality, and consciousness is unproduced
no abiding
The unproduced is explained this way: where there is no arising
no passing away
that is called the unproduced purified of the three spheres
And why
The co-produced should be understood just like the unproduced
The essence of all dharmas is no-essence
in that respect, there is no duality
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is a basis of non-division
In that respect, what is non-division
hat is the basis
No-notion is non-division
The tathatā is the basis
No-ground-to-stand-upon is non-division
The dharmadhātu is the basis
Non-multiplicity is non-division
Emptiness is non-division
The true limit is the basis
Non-apprehension is non-division
Non-movement is the basis
No-sign is the basis
Non-deliberation is non-division
No-wish is the basis
Being without a sentient being is the basis
Non-essence of a sentient being is non-division
Space is the basis
Non-perception is non-division
Non-arising is the basis
Non-cessation is non-division
The unproduced is the basis
The unproduced is the basis
No moving about is non-division
Awakening is the basis
Pacification is non-division
Nirvāṇa is the basis
Non-development is non-division
non-birth is the basis
And why
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is not realized by the bod
nor by the mind
The body, Mañjuśrī, is inert, motionless, and insentient
It is similar and comparable to grass, logs of wood, walls, or clay
“The mind, on the other hand, can be compared to an illusion
It is hollow, void, unreal, and unproduced
Mañjuśrī, to realize the body and mind in this manner is explained as awakening
This is based on conventional usage, but it is not in the ultimate sense
Mañjuśrī, awakening cannot be explained in terms of the body, the mind, or dharma, non-dharma, real, unreal, truth, or falsity
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, cannot be expressed through any dharma
Mañjuśrī, awakening does not have the slightest location that allows it to enter conventional usage
In the same way, Mañjuśrī, awakening has no location
space has no location
it is unproduced
non-arisen
unceasing
cannot be expressed
Mañjuśrī, when searching for the real space, it cannot be explained through any dharma
Mañjuśrī, when searching for the real awakening, it cannot be explained through any dharma
Mañjuśrī, with respect to what is real, no words can be found, because it is non-arisen and unceasing
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, means to be ungraspable and to have no abode
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what is it to be ungraspable
what is it to have no abode
what is it to have no abode
The thorough cognition of the eye, Mañjuśrī, is to be ungraspable
The non-perception of form is to have no abode
The thorough cognition of the ear is to be ungraspable
The non-perception of sound is to have no abode
The thorough cognition of the nose is to be ungraspable
The non-perception of smell is to have no abode
The thorough cognition of the tongue is to be ungraspable
The non-perception of flavor is to have no abode
The thorough cognition of the body is to be ungraspable
The non-perception of touchable things is to have no abode
The thorough cognition of the mind is to be ungraspable
The non-perception of dharmas is to have no abode
In this way, the Tathāgata has realized awakening, ungraspable and without abode
the eye-consciousness has no ground to stand upon
Not grasping at the ear an
not perceiving sounds, the ear-consciousness has no ground to stand upon
Not grasping at the nose an
not perceiving smells, the nose-consciousness has no ground to stand upon
Not grasping at the body an
not perceiving touchable things, the body-consciousness has no ground to stand upon
Not grasping at the mind an
not perceiving dharmas, the mind-consciousness has no ground to stand upon
Therefore, as his consciousness has no ground to stand upon, he comes to be counted as the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfect and Complete Buddha
“Mañjuśrī, there are four grounds for the minds of sentient beings to stand upon
Which four
Form is a ground for the mind of sentient beings to stand upon
Similarly
Mañjuśrī, feeling, notion, and co-producing factors are grounds for the minds of sentient beings to stand upon
Mañjuśrī, these four grounds for the mind to stand upon are known by the Tathāgata to be non-arisen and unceasing
Mañjuśrī, these four grounds for the mind to stand upon are known by the Tathāgata to be non-arisen and unceasing
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is an appellation for emptiness
Mañjuśrī, the emptiness by which awakening is empty is also the emptiness by which all dharmas are empty
And the Tathāgata realized them, precisely in the way in which they are empty
Mañjuśrī, it is not that emptiness is realized through emptiness
there is one single method: emptiness, or awakening
And why
Mañjuśrī, where there is no emptiness, there is no awakening
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, there is no duality by which emptiness and awakening could be made into two
Mañjuśrī, all dharmas are non-dual
without characteristics, not made into two
without names
without signs
free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
non-arise
unceasing
not acting
not moving forth
not occurring
without syllables
without speech
Mañjuśrī, that which is called empty is an appellation for no attachment and no grasping
On the other hand, Mañjuśrī, in the ultimate sense, no dharma called empty is there to be perceived
On the other hand, Mañjuśrī
the sky is called sky, yet the sky cannot be expressed
In the same way, Mañjuśrī, we say ‘empty, empty’ as an entrance to inexpressible, empty things
“All dharmas are nameless
yet all dharmas are described through names
Mañjuśrī, a name is not placed in either a primary or an intermediate location
without characteristics
“Thus, Mañjuśrī, all the dharmas are known by the Tathāgata to be, from the very beginning, unborn, non-arisen
free from mind, mentality, and consciousness
without syllables
without voice
They are known to be just free
it is not that they are first bound and then freed
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is the same as the sky
The sky is neither even nor uneven
Awakening, too, is neither even nor uneven
And why
Mañjuśrī, a dharma with no real perfection cannot be spoken of as either even or uneven
Therefore, Mañjuśrī, all dharmas are realized by the Tathāgata as neither even nor uneven
They are realized in such a way that not even an atom is made even or uneven
Dharmas are cognized just as they are
“And how does that accord with the awareness of reality
Mañjuśrī, all dharmas, non-arisen and unceasing, come into being after having not existed
Just like awakening, so also feeling, notion, co-producing factors, and consciousness do not swerve from the tathatā
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what is a consistent basis
Mañjuśrī, just like awakening, so also form does not swerve from the tathatā
In this way, Mañjuśrī, they come into existence and go out of existence
Thus it is said that the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma for the sake of cutting off the dharmas
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is a consistent basis
Just like awakening, so also feeling, notion, co-producing factors, and consciousness do not swerve from the tathatā
Just like awakening, so also the earth element does not swerve from the tathatā
Just like awakening, so also the water element
the heat element
the wind element do not swerve from the tathatā
“Just like awakening, so also the eye-base
the eye-consciousness-base do not swerve from the tathatā
Just like awakening, Mañjuśrī, the ear-base
the sound-base
the ear-consciousness-base
the nose-base
the smell-base
the nose-consciousness-base
the tongue-base
the flavor-base
the tongue-consciousness-base
the body-base
the touchable-base
the body-consciousness-base
the mind-base
the dharma-base
the mind-consciousness-base do not swerve from the tathatā
“And dharmas can be designate
just as this: the aggregates
the bases, an
the entrances
And this entire set has been realized by the Tathāgata as consistent
as it is before, so also is it later, and in between
It is unborn in the prior limit
not transferred at the later limit, an
isolated in the middle
In this way, for all those things there is a ‘consistent basis.
Just as one is, so are all
just as all are, so is one
And in this respect, Mañjuśrī, neither oneness nor plurality is perceived
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, enters the aspect-less by entering an aspect
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what is an aspect, and what is the aspect-less
The aspect, Mañjuśrī, is explained as taking up all wholesome dharmas
The aspect-less is explained as the non-perception of any dharmas
The aspect is explained as the stabilization of an unstable mind
The aspect-less is explained as the gate to liberation of the samādhi of no-sign
The aspect-less is explained as the gate to liberation of the samādhi of no-sign
The aspect is explained as thinking, comparing, counting, and thorough consideration of all dharmas
The aspect-less is explained as transcending comparison
What is transcending comparison
It is that with respect to which there is no function of consciousness
The aspect is explained as the thorough consideration of the co-produced
The aspect-less is explained as the thorough consideration of the unproduced
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is without outflows and without clinging
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, how is it without outflows, and how is it without clinging
Being without outflows, Mañjuśrī, is explained as the absence of the four outflows
Which four
They are: the outflow of desire
the outflow of existence
the outflow of views
the outflow of ignorance, an
“Being without clinging is explained as the absence of four types of clinging
They are: clinging to desire
clinging to views
clinging to positing a self
clinging to one’s attachment to discipline and vows, an
“Beings are blinded by ignorance
Craving disturbs them
They develop mutual attachment and cling to each other
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata thoroughly understands that the root of clinging is the position of a self
Through self-purity, he understands the purity of all sentient beings
The purity of self is the purity of all sentient beings. The purity of all sentient beings is non-dual, not divided into two
And the meaning of non-duality is non-arising and non-cessation
“With respect to non-arising and non-cessation, Mañjuśrī, mind, mentality, and consciousness do not come about
In that respect there is no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperly
In that respect there is no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperly
Whosoever engages in proper mental placement does not give rise to ignorance
Not giving rise to ignorance means not giving rise to the twelve limbs of existence
Not giving rise to the twelve limbs of existence means no birth
No birth is the fixed rule
The fixed rule is the definitive meaning
The definitive meaning is the ultimate meaning
The ultimate meaning means to be devoid of a person
The meaning of being devoid of a person is the ineffable meaning
The ineffable meaning is the meaning of dependent arising
The meaning of dependent arising is the meaning of the Dharma
The meaning of the Dharma is the meaning of the Tathāgata
Hence it is said, ‘One who sees dependent arising sees the Dharma
one who sees the Dharma sees the Tathāgata.
And he sees in such a way that, when he searches, he does not see anything whatsoever
“Awakening, Mañjuśrī, is pure, stainless, and without disturbance
In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what is purity, what is meant by stainless, and what is non-disturbance
Emptiness, Mañjuśrī, is purity
no-sign is stainless
no-wish is non-disturbance
Non-birth is purity
non-effort is stainless
non-arising is non-disturbance
The nature is purity
complete purity is stainless
luminosity is non-disturbance
No elaboration is purity
freedom from elaboration is stainless
the pacification of elaborations is non-disturbance
In this way, the Tathāgata has realized, through their very sameness, that all these dharmas are equal
When one does not see the mind and the point of reference, one then sees reality
the pacification of elaborations is non-disturbance
The tathatā is purity
the dharmadhātu is stainless
the pinnacle of reality is non-disturbance
Space is purity
the sky is stainless
the atmosphere is non-disturbance
“To thoroughly cognize inside is purity
not to move forth on the outside is stainless
non-perception inside and outside is non-disturbance
To thoroughly cognize the aggregates is purity
the essencelessness of the bases is stainless
putting away the entrances is non-disturbance
To cognize past destruction is purity
to cognize future non-arising is stainless
to cognize the present abiding of the dharmadhātu is non-disturbance
“In this way, Mañjuśrī, purity, the stainless, and non-disturbance are collected within a single basis
the peaceful basis
That which is peaceful is very peaceful
That which is very peaceful is utterly peaceful
That which is utterly peaceful is utter pacification
utter pacification is called the sage
Thus, Mañjuśrī, just like space, so is awakening
Just like awakening, so are the dharmas
Just like the dharmas, so are sentient beings
Just like sentient beings, so are the fields
Just like the fields, so is nirvāṇa
Therefore, Mañjuśrī, it is said that all dharmas are the same as nirvāṇa
Since this is their ultimate mode, there is no counteragent
Because there is no counteragent, they are primordially pure
primordially stainless, an
primordially without disturbances
It is thus, Mañjuśrī, that the Tathāgata realized all dharmas to be; as he observes the sphere of sentient beings, a pure, great compassion that is free from disturbances, called play, comes about toward those sentient beings
“Mañjuśrī, how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
“Mañjuśrī, how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
nor is he disturbed by utter non-arising
Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva does not think of destruction, arising, non-destruction, non-arising, and the utter destruction of destruction
And why
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva may practice thinking that ‘form is not empty’ and also ‘not non-empty.
‘Form itself is empty of the essence of form
Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva does not practice by thinking, ‘The past mind is destroyed;
Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
“Mañjuśrī, giving, awakening, and sentient beings and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata: these are non-dual
they are not divided into two. Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī, discipline, awakening, and sentient beings and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata: these are non-dual, they are not divided into two. Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
Practicing in this way, Mañjuśrī, that bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
n the same way, feeling, notion, co-producing factors, and consciousness are empty.’ He practices thinking in this way and also thinking that ‘they are not non-empty.
In the same way, feeling, notion, co-producing factors, and consciousness are empty.’ He practices thinking in this way and also thinking that ‘they are not non-empty.
And why
Because mind, mentality, and consciousness are not perceived. “Mañjuśrī, there is no dharma whatsoever that could be thoroughly cognized, dispelled, cultivated, or directly realized
Mañjuśrī, that which is understood as destruction is simply the destruction of extremes
As it is indestructible and not destroyed, it is without destruction
And that which is completely destroyed is not something one should cause to be destroyed
It conforms to destruction
conforming to destruction is the destruction of nothing whatsoever
And that, wherein there is no destruction of anything whatsoever, is unproduced
With respect to the unproduced, there is no arisin
and no cessation
“Therefore it is said, ‘Whether the tathāgatas arise or not
this dharmatā is invariable; it is the invariability of the dharmas, the dharmadhātu.
Just like the invariability of the dharmadhātu, the Tathāgata’s awareness is neither occurring nor ceasing
The destruction of the outflows, Mañjuśrī, is a conventional expression, speech, syllables, sign, and designation
Here no dharma whatsoever arises or ceases.
Then the youthful Mañjuśrī rose from his seat
folded his upper robe
placed his right knee on the ground
Folding his hands in the direction of the Bhagavat
he praised him with these verses
“You have no color, sign, or shape
you are free of any point of reference: I bow to you
“You have no ground to stand upon
No striving or giving up
“You are not situated in any dharma
Bereft of existence or non-existence
You obtained the sameness of co-producing factors
“Free from the three world spheres
You have attained the sky’s own sameness
You are not defiled by desires
No root and no ground to stand upon
No cessation or origination
Entering the Dharma method in this way, the outflows do not arise and do not cease
he does not practice by thinking, ‘The present mind abides.
he does not practice by thinking, ‘The future mind has yet to be obtained;
He is not stuck in the past, future, or present mind. As he practices in this way
the Tathāgata; diligence, awakening, and sentient beings, and
the Tathāgata
awakening, and sentient beings, and
These are non-dual, they are not divided into two
“You always remain in samādhi
Whichever your posture may be
As you move, stand, or lie down
“You arrive evenly and go evenly
Remaining well placed in sameness
You are not disturbed at sameness
“You are absorbed in sameness
In samādhi within all dharmas
Absorbed in the sign-less
“Unplaced, without point of reference
Your samādhi is the peak of wisdom
You have become the lord of Dharma
you are free of any point of reference: I bow to you
free from the six entrances
“In one instant, you see The forms, voices, and postures Of all sentient beings
“Free from name and form
You cut off all causes and aggregates
You are the entrance into the aspect-less
“You are free from sign
And bereft of their aspects
You are the entrance into the sign-less
“You do not form concepts
your mind has no ground to stand upon
You have no recollection or mental placement
“Space is without abode
It is free from elaboration and stainless
Your mind is the same as space
“Space is without edge or center
so, too, is the dharmatā of the buddhas
You have gone beyond the three times
You have gone beyond the three times
“The buddhas have the characteristic of space
And space has no characteristics
You are free from effect and cause
you cannot be grasped
“Like the moon in the water
You are not placed in any dharma
“Free from the two extremes
You cut off the view of ‘self.
You obtained sameness with the dharmadhātu
“You are free from form and number
“You are not dwelling in the aggregates, The bases, or the entrances
You are free from distortions
bereft of any false dharmas
You neither cling to, nor abandon
“You have gone beyond the faults of Mār
reached the path of the dharmadhātu
You have the feature of non-obscuration
“Those who understand the meaning, Do not say ‘he exists’ or ‘he does not.
You are not in the realm of words
“Not relying on duality
You are free from duality and non-duality
You cut down the banner of pride
You are inconceivable, without compare
“You have subdued all mental flaws, And the four flaws of the body
“You conduct yourself effortlessly
you are bereft of any flaws
Awareness precedes all your actions
Your recollection has no outflows
It is subtle and conforms to what is real and unreal
You have no abode and no thoughts
“With your mind free of a point of reference
You understand well the mind of all
While having no notion of ‘self’ and ‘others.
You remain unobscured
Makes everyone’s mind bewildered
“Taking up points of referenc
you are free of any point of reference: I bow to you
a mind without point of referenc
Cannot essentially be found
You obtained inconceivable sameness
“With your unplaced awareness
You see all the fields
And the conduct of all beings
you know everything about all dharmas
“The buddhas do not apprehend the mind, In any way, ever
“Illusion-like are all dharmas
Yet the illusion itself cannot be found
You are free from the dharma of illusion
“Perfect Buddha, you act in the world
Not dwelling upon worldly dharmas
you do not form concepts about the ‘world.
You declare what is empty as empty
You are absorbed into freedom from multiplicity
“Through great powers and illusory samādhi, You perform miracles
“You are neither one, nor many
You are neither far, nor near
You neither remove, nor add
“Through the diamond-like samādhi
You obtained supreme awakening in one instant
You are absorbed into non-appearance
“You know nirvāṇa to be unmoving in the three times
You are a guide endowed with many methods
You know nirvāṇa to be unmoving
“You are expert in understanding which methods
“You are free from signs, effortless
Free from elaboration, and untainted
Free from appearance, free from a ‘self,
You are omniscient with respect to everything
You yourself know the self as it is
“Free from concepts, free from what belongs to a self
you are free of any point of reference: I bow to you
“I salute you, who have ten powers and have crossed the stream
I salute you, the fearless one who bestows fearlessness
You obtained certainty in the unshared dharmas
Guide for the entire world, I salute you
“I salute you, who break the bondage of fetters
I salute you, who reached the other shore and remain on dry ground
I salute you, guide for the exhausted world
I salute you, who go to saṃsāra and remain unplaced
Sage, Buddha, you practiced emptiness
You are untainted, like a lotus by the waters it grows in
I salute you, who are free from a point of reference and crossed the great stream
“Isolation is the unexcelled state of the Teacher
“I salute the inconceivable Buddha of great power, Who is the same as space and without abode
You have thoroughly eliminated all signs, And you wish for nothing whatsoever
I salute you, supreme holder of all good qualities
I salute you, whose glory rises up like Meru.
Then the Bhagavat praised the youthful Mañjuśrī
“Good, Mañjuśrī, that is good
You have spoken well, Mañjuśrī
It is just as you said
Mañjuśrī, the buddhas should not be seen through form, through dharmas, through characteristics, or through the dharmadhātu
The buddhas do not stay by themselve
nor do they reside among many people
The buddhas have not been seen by anyone, nor heard, nor worshipped, nor are they being worshipped now
“The buddhas did not obtain awakening
The buddhas do not make oneness or plurality out of any dharma
The buddhas are not increased by any dharma
No dharma has been seen by the buddhas, nor has it been heard, recollected, cognized, or known
No dharma has been seen by the buddhas, nor has it been heard, recollected, cognized, or known
The buddhas have not spoken or expressed anything
They do not speak or express anything
They will not speak or express anything
The buddhas do not gain supreme realization
The buddhas do not supremely realize any dharma
The buddhas’ afflictions have not been destroyed
Buddhas have not directly realized purification
Buddhas have not seen any dharma, nor heard it, smelt it, tasted it, touched it, or cognized it
And why
Because of the primordial purity of all dharmas
such a person engenders even more merit
All the more so for one who writes down this Dharma teaching or makes others write i
“Mañjuśrī, there are many sentient beings to be found in the great trichiliocosm, whether born from an egg
born from a womb
born from moisture
born suddenly
some with form, others formless
some with notions, others without notions
some without feet, others with two feet
some with four feet, or with many feet. Now, imagine that all of them obtain a human body, without precedent, but not their last
Once they obtain a human body, they give rise to bodhicitta
Having given rise to bodhicitta
each and every one of those bodhisattvas attends as many buddhas, together with bodhisattvas and hearers
as there are atomic particles in buddhafields as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges
he collects all the necessities for their happiness
offers robes, alms-food, bedding, seats, herbs that counteract illness, and provisions
for as many eons as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges
pearls
with raised umbrellas, standards, and flags
“Now imagine another bodhisattva, with the right inclination, who listens to this Dharma teaching, The Ornament of the Light of Awareness That Enters the Domain of All Buddhas, and then believes in it, engages with it, trusts it
realizes it, or teaches at least one of its stanzas. Compared to the bodhisattvas first mentioned, he would engender even more uncountable merit that would lead him to follow the awareness of a buddha
Compared to the merit he would produce, the production of merit in the first instance, consisting of the bodhisattvas’ acts of giving, would not even amount to a hundredth part
It would not even count for one thousandth or one-billionth of it. It would not even count as any part, any number worthy of consideration, simile or approximation of any kind
“Mañjuśrī, imagine a householder bodhisattva who attends as many buddhas and bodhisattvas
together with their saṅgha of hearers, as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges
He would offer them robes, alms-food, bedding, seats, remedies for exhaustion, medicinal herbs, and provisions
another ordained bodhisattva, disciplined and with the right inclination, may give a morsel of food to a single sentient being born as an animal
another ordained bodhisattva, disciplined and with the right inclination, may give a morsel of food to a single sentient being born as an animal
Compared to the merit he would produce, the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth part
together with their saṅgha of hearers, as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. He would offer robes, alms-food, bedding, seats, remedies for exhaustion, medicinal herbs, and provisions, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges
“Mañjuśrī, imagine as many bodhisattvas as there are atomic particles in the great trichiliocosm, all of them ordained, disciplined, and pure in their inclinations. Each bodhisattva would attend as many buddhas and bodhisattvas
Compared to the merit he would produce, the production of merit in the first instance, consisting of the bodhisattvas’ acts of giving, would not even amount to a hundredth part
It would not even bear approximation of any kind
It would not even count for one thousandth or one-billionth of it
It would not even count for one thousandth or one-billionth of it
offer it as a gift to the buddhas, the bhagavats
“Mañjuśrī, imagine that a bodhisattva great being were to fill the great trichiliocosm with seven precious substances an
But another bodhisattva may teach just a four-line stanza from this Dharma method to another bodhisattva
Compared to the merit he would produce, the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth part
It would not even count for one thousandth or one-billionth of i
It would not even bear approximation of any kind
“Mañjuśrī, consider that the production of merit of someone giving offerings were to continue for as many eons as there are atomic particles in a great trichiliocosm
Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges would be there
each bodhisattva would cover as many golden buddhafields as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges
all their trees, with divine clothes, and then cover them in nets of gems and jewels shining in all possible ways
He would then fill them with high palaces made of precious vaśirāja gem
surrounded with vedikās of the precious vidyutpradīpa gems. Once filled, he would give them as a gift, with raised parasols, standards, and flags, to as many buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, each and every day
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī, if all sentient beings included in the three world spheres were to be born in the hells, or as animals, or as pretas in the world of Yama
“It is as follows: Mañjuśrī, if all sentient beings included in the three world spheres were to be born in the hells, or as animals, or as pretas in the world of Yama
a householder bodhisattva may pull all of them out from those hells, the animal realm, and the preta world of Yama and establish them in the state of a pratyekabuddha
But another ordained bodhisattva may just give a morsel of food to one sentient being born as an animal
Compared to the first, the second would engender a greater merit, an uncountably greater merit
by not grasping at the eye and not perceiving form
the form-base, an
Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva may establish as many sentient beings as there are atomic particles in a great trichiliocosm into the state of a pratyekabuddha, but he may still have no belief in this Dharma teaching
Another bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, who believes in this Dharma teachin
engenders much more merit than the first
All those bodhisattvas would thus produce merit through their acts of giving
But another bodhisattva, pure in his inclinations and disciplined, whether householder or ordained
Offering in this way, he would give this gift for as many eons as there are atomic particles of dust in a great trichiliocosm
But another bodhisattva may teach just a four-line stanza from this Dharma method to another bodhisattva
In this way, he would offer such gifts for eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges
But another bodhisattva may believe in this Dharma teaching an
teach just a single four-foot stanza from it to another bodhisattva
Compared to the merit he would produce, the production of merit in the first instance, consisting of the bodhisattvas’ acts of giving, would not even amount to a hundredth part
He would then attend upon each tathāgata, and the corresponding bodhisattvas and hearers, for as many eons as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous, tens of quintillions of buddhafields
He would offer robes, alms-food, bedding, seats, remedies for exhaustion, medicinal herbs, and provisions
Compared to the merit he would produce, the production of merit in the first instance, consisting of the bodhisattvas’ acts of giving, would not even amount to a hundredth part
And why
It would not even count for one thousandth or one-billionth of it. It would not even count as any part, any number worthy of consideration, simile or approximation of any kind
The seal of non-returning bodhisattvas is to hear this Dharma teaching
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows out of conviction
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of one who follows the meaning
In that case, the latter would engender incalculably greater merit
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the meaning
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of one who follows the Dharma
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the Dharma
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of attaining the stream
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of attaining the stream
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of a once-returner
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a once-returner
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of a non-returner
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a non-returner
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of an arhat
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of an arhat
In that case, the latter would engender incalculably greater merit

another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of a pratyekabuddha
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a pratyekabuddha
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in bodhicitta
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in bodhicitta
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of irreversibility
“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of irreversibility
at least cause a single sentient being to engage with this Dharma teaching
another bodhisattva, believing in this Dharma teaching, might make others write it down, might shed light on it
Then, at that time, the Bhagavat spoke the following verses
if another listens with reverence to this sūtra
“In the final times of decay, a bodhisattva May uphold the good Dharma of a hundred million buddhas
His merit will be great, and exceed the former
Eliciting compassion, not craving for any pleasure
He may then salute all of those sacred persons
if for just a brief moment, Another teaches others this sūtra
Will have sharp wisdom and great strengt
The fruit of his merit will exceed the former
keeps his mind well disposed toward the Sugata’s teaching
quickly reach the level of the buddhas
Have attained complete nirvāṇa, Without any remainder
This was translated, edited, and finalized by the Indian scholar Surendrabodhi, the translator-editor Bhande Yeshe De, and others
“He may establish tall and beautiful stūpas, Beautified with fine gems to the summit of existence
Thus spoke the Bhagava
This completes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra The Ornament of the Light of Awareness That Enters the Domain of All Buddhas
Here the body of the tathāgatas, Like the space-element, is shown to all.
“This sūtra is extolled by the sugatas, And upheld by many bodhisattvas
His merit will indeed be immeasurable, And he shall obtain awakening, in accordance with his wish
Removing all stains of miserliness and being without fear
“If a bodhisattva upholds this Dharma
Then the fruit of his merit exceeds the former
“Yet, when hearing this very sūtra, a bodhisattva May form the wish to establish it well, Either within his body or within a book
With parasols, standards, and the sound of bells, They would rise to the summit of existence
“The Sugata taught this sūtra, a lamp for gods and men
Each bodhisattva, everywhere within the ten directions, would then see as many buddhas, as many bhagavats, as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous, tens of quintillions of buddhafields
To each tathāgata, each and every day, he would offer as many world spheres as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous, tens of trillions of buddhafields, after filling them with the precious vaśirāja gems
But another bodhisattva, believing in this Dharma teaching, may give just one morsel of food to a sentient being born as an animal
By using one’s own special powers, Someone may travel through the ten directions
And worship a hundred million buddhas

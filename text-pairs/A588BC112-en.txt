A Synopsis of Guru Padmasambhava’s Life
Emaho!
With neither cause nor condition you were magically born
From a lotus flower on the Milky Lake in the South, Padmasambhava,
I supplicate you! Pray remove my obstacles;
Obliterate invading forces;
And grant all favorable conditions for the comfort of beings and the teaching of Buddha.
In the future may we all awaken as a single gathering
In the Palace of the Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain,
Indivisible from you, the master of Uḍḍiyāna!

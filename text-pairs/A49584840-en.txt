Prayer to Śāntideva and Dam, Tsang and Jam of Katok
Throughout all your lives, you took the protector Mañjughoṣa
As the lord of your buddha family, and, for the sake of all,
Illuminated the excellent path of a bodhisattva’s way of life—
To Śāntideva, heir of the victorious ones, I pay homage!
Katok Dampa, 1 who was the sole crown-ornament without equal,
Tsangtönpa, 2 who reached the level of Universal Illumination, 3
And glorious Jampa Bum, 4 who was the omniscient one in person—
To these three sources of the teachings, I pray!
Sönam Bum, 5 who was a sovereign of all the teachings,
Yeshe Bum, 6 who reached consummate realization of generation and perfection,
And Jangchub Pal, 7 who mastered the discipline of reviving the dead—
To these three beacons of the teachings, I pray!

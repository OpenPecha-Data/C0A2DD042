Swift Enchantment of the Three Realms A Sādhana of Red Tārā
Namaḥ tārā-bhaṭṭarakāya!
I and all other beings take refuge in the Three Jewels
From now until the attainment of awakening.
In order to bring benefit to beings,
I shall meditate on Red Tārā.
May sentient beings be happy, free from suffering,
And having found happiness, abide in equanimity.
Out of emptiness appears a syllable Vaṃ,
And upon the bed of a red lotus,
From āḥ, upon a moon disc seat,
Appears a red utpala marked with a red hrīḥ.
Light radiates out, makes offerings to the noble ones, purifies wrongdoing and obscurations,
And as it returns I become Red Tārā,
With a single face, two hands and three eyes.
She holds a hook in her right hand and lasso in her left,
And has the youth of a sixteen year-old girl.
She is adorned with silk and jewel ornaments
And sits in the cross-legged posture of a bodhisattva.
At her three centres are the syllables oṃ āḥ hūṃ
And at her heart is red syllable hrīḥ,
From which light radiates out to invite the wisdom beings,
Who merge indivisibly through jaḥ, hūṃ, baṃ and ho.
Light radiates and the empowerment deities remain before me in the sky.
They confer empowerment and purify obscurations.
Amitābha, lord of the family, adorns my crown.
At her heart, upon a red utpala ,
Is a moon disc and a red hrīḥ,
Surrounded by the mantra garland, red in colour.
It radiates light, which attracts
All the blessings of the victorious ones and their heirs.
All living beings throughout the three realms
And whatever magnificent riches I desire
Are drawn towards me in the form of red light
And, being absorbed, brought under my control.
oṃ tāre tuttāre ture saṃtāre tāraṇi hrīḥ svāhā
oṃ ārya tāre sapārivara oṃ vajra puṣpe āḥ hūṃ
Śabda
Tārā, for me and all sentient beings,
Bring appearances and mind under our control.
Let the wisdom deities depart for basic space.
My three centres are marked by oṃ, āḥ and hūṃ—
White, red, and blue in colour.

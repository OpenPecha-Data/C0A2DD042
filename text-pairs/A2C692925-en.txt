Prayer for the Long Life of Khyenrab Chökyi Özer
Namo guru mañjughoṣāya!
You have discovered supreme immaculate wisdom-knowledge,
And realized the nature of the Dharma, profound and vast,
Now through a thousand shining rays of excellent explanation,
You nurture the lotus-garden of disciples—may your life be long!
With the roots of your pure ethical discipline firmly planted,
The foliage and flowers of study and contemplation bloomed,
And branches are laden with the fruits of genuine meditation—
Guide and teacher, wish-fulfilling tree, may your life be long!
Glorious guru, may your lotus-feet remain forever stable,
May all your wisdom aspirations be spontaneously fulfilled,
And may the immaculate and noble Sakya tradition
Of the lord of perfect wisdom flourish and spread in all directions!

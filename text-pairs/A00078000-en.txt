Essence and Embodiment of All the Buddhas 1
Guru, watch over me!
Essence and embodiment of all the buddhas,
Venerable lord, great treasury of wisdom,
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo,
Look upon me from the invisible sphere.
Embodiment of his pristine wisdom,
Great treasury of excellent Dharma speech,
Jamgön Chökyi Lodrö,
To you I pray.
Consider me with your loving compassion.
Cause my character to blend with the Dharma.
Inspire me with your blessings, O venerable lord,
That I may continue my practice to completion.
No matter what arises, happiness or sorrow, good or bad,
O guru, watch over me!

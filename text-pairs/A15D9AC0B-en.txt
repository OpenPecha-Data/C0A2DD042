The Spontaneous Fulfilment of Wishes A Daily Prayer to Gesar, King of the Dralas
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
We invoke you, we present offerings to you, Great Lion Norbu Dradül, embodiment of all Three Roots,
Lord of demon-subduing activity,
Herald of all yogis,
Vital support of all vidyādharas,
Great drala for all living beings, together with your consort, heirs and retinue,
And the thirty warrior kinsmen, including Puwo Bumpa and Gyatsa Shalkar,
The eighteen maidens, such as the glorious queen of ḍākinīs,
The armies of devas, nāgas, and nyen ,
The allied forces of dralas and wermas,
Together with their aides and the arrogant spirits of appearance and existence—to you all, I present vast offerings, both real and imagined, including the select portion of samaya substances. I praise you! I exalt you!
From now until reach the essence of awakening, be a patron deity and warrior spirit to this practitioner!
Be a refuge and protector, a supportive force!
Guard against all sickness, obstructing forces, obstacles and disharmony!
Expand and increase ever further my lifespan, merit, resources, influence, fame, charisma, confidence, and progeny—all the objects of my desire!
Bring whomsoever we wish, including deities, demons and human beings, under our control!
Annihilate all malevolent and malicious enemies and obstacle-makers! Swiftly bring us the qualities of the paths and stages and cause us to attain unsurpassable awakening!
Bring us all the physical strength of the oceans of dralas and wermas, and grant us all the siddhis of perfect victory over all!

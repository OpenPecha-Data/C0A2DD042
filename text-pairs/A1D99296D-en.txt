Prayer for the Long Life of Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
Born from the lake of Mañjughoṣa’s wisdom (Jamyang Khyentse),
You are the adamantine sovereign of the oceanic dharma.
Supreme emanation inseparable from the three protectors. 1
I pray to you: may your three secrets remain without change.
Upon the golden ground of the three sets of vows kept purely,
The treasures—qualities of boundless study, contemplation and meditation—
Are perfected within the peaceful ocean of your mind, a beautiful treasury of gems.
Supreme tulku, may your three secrets remain forever.
May your extraordinary actions—of cultivating a learned and accomplished saṅgha,
Explaining and spreading the long-standing tradition of the Ten Great Pillars, 2
Along with the flow of the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions of the pioneers of the practice lineage—endure.
And may your wondrous illuminating influence expand and increase for evermore!

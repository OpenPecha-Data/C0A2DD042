Cloud Banks of Blessings A Brief Prayer to the Garland of Successive Rebirths from the Expansive Treasury of Dharmatā Realization
Emaho!
Out of the uncompounded sky-like expanse of the dharmadhātu,
Radiance arises unobstructedly as emptiness and clarity, the play of compassion,
And Vajrayoginī, complete with the supreme of all features,
Manifests like the play of the moon in water, to all who need to be trained,
Taking on infinite forms, according to what is most effective.
To the supreme liberator of beings in every realm, I pray!
A glorious, accomplished master in the noble land of India
With power over the five elements, Red Vetala, 1
And then, in Tibet, before Guru Padmākara,
His consort, Shelkar Dorje Tso,
Who gained the power of unfailing memory—to you I pray!
With Tsogyal's blessings, you took charge of profound treasures,
And were Kunga Buma, Changchub Chödrön and the rest—
To this garland of successive rebirths, I pray!
In the heart of Tibet you were a hidden yoginī, 2
Appearing ordinary and with mastery of profound treasures,
Nurturing, through various means, disciples and the two forms of terma,
And leading everyone with a connection to the realm of Lotus Light—
Dechen Dewé Dorje, to you I pray!
Care for me, without ever parting, in this life, the next, and the bardo states,
Lead me to realize the intent of the Luminous Great Perfection,
And awaken as Samantabhadra, pure from the very beginning!

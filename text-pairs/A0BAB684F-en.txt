The Melodious Song of Immortality: A Prayer for Long Life
Hrīḥ. In the divine maṇḍala of the utter purity of appearance and existence,
You mature and liberate ordinary body, speech and mind as the three vajras,
Lord of all buddha families, teacher of the tantras,
Vajra sovereign: may your life remain forever firm!
Within the vajra body, you manifest the maṇḍala of great bliss,
The secret body, speech and mind that are indestructible.
Most supreme lord of the vajra transmission,
Vajra master: may your life be secure for a hundred aeons!
Holder of the profound and perfect instructions
For directly revealing, through the path beyond effort,
The space of great bliss, unchanging awareness:
Glorious guru, may your life remain secure until the end of existence!
Precious regent of the gurus of the three lineages,
May you remain forever in the vajra body, throughout past, present and future!
And may the victory banner of the Dharma of the three transmissions
Remain forever aloft, everywhere throughout the three planes of existence!

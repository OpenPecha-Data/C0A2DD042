Vajra Speech of the Prayer to Noble Avalokiteśvara from the Great Siddha Thangtong Gyalpo's Life as Bhikṣu Padma Karpo
To you I pray, guru Avalokiteśvara.
To you I pray, yidam Avalokiteśvara.
To you I pray, sublime noble Avalokiteśvara.
To you I pray, lord of refuge Avalokiteśvara.
To you I pray, loving protector Avalokiteśvara.
Hold me in your compassion, caring and victorious one.
For us beings who wander endlessly throughout saṃsāra
And are subjected to intolerable pain and suffering,
Protector, we have no other refuge but you.
Inspire us to attain omniscience and awakening.
Through the force of negative karma, accumulated throughout beginningless time,
Beings who are overcome with hatred take birth in the hells,
Where they suffer the torments of intense heat and cold:
May they all be reborn in your presence, O supreme of deities!
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Through the force of negative karma, accumulated throughout beginningless time,
Beings who are overcome with miserliness take birth in the preta realm,
Where they suffer the torments of intense hunger and thirst:
May they all be reborn in your supreme Potala pureland!
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Through the force of negative karma, accumulated throughout beginningless time,
Beings who are overcome with folly take birth as animals,
And experience the misery of verbal incapacity and confusion:
May they all be reborn in your presence, O protector!
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Through the force of negative karma, accumulated throughout beginningless time,
Beings who are overcome with jealousy take birth in the asura realm,
Where they suffer the torments of conflict and dispute:
May they all be reborn in the Potala pureland!
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Through the force of negative karma, accumulated throughout beginningless time,
Beings who are overcome with pride take birth in the deva realm,
Where they suffer the torments of transmigration and fall:
May they all be reborn in the Potala pureland!
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Through the force of negative karma, accumulated throughout beginningless time,
Beings who are overcome with passionate desire take birth in the human realm,
Where they suffer the torments of birth, old age, sickness and death:
May they all be reborn in the Potala pureland! 1
Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
May I, in this and all my future lives,
Through activity like that of Avalokiteśvara,
Liberate the beings of impure realms,
And transmit the supreme speech of the six syllables throughout the ten directions!
Through the force of invoking you, the supremely noble,
May all those whom I must discipline and guide,
Take interest in cause and effect, strive to act virtuously,
And come to possess the qualities that may benefit all.

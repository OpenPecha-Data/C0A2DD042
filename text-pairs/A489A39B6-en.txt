Prayer to Drukpa Kunley
Magical dance of the wisdom of the victorious ones of the three times,
Manifesting in the form of a Śrī Heruka,
Protector of beings to be trained and supreme progenitor of siddhas—
Kunga Lekpa, at your feet I pray:
Inspire me to liberate dualistic perception into the dharmatā expanse
And remain inseparable from you, the guru.

The Song of Devotion Verses of Aspiration for the Fulfilment of the Enlightened Vision of Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok, the Reincarnation of Tertön Lerab Lingpa
O lord of sages, Śākyamuni, who through abandoning and realizing attained supreme buddhahood,
With your heart sons, Lord Maitreya and Mañjughoṣa,
The seven patriarchs, 1 the seventeen great paṇḍitas 2 and the like,
All you great founders of the teachings in the noble land of India,
And especially you who introduced the excellent path in Tibet;
The three ancestral Dharma kings, 3
The second buddha—Padmākara,
Śāntarakṣita and your entire lineage: recollecting your kindness fills us with faith and devotion.
So as to bring living inspiration to countless beings, you spread
The teachings of Buddha, our victorious guide endowed with four-fold fearlessness,
Radiating them, with the five perfections, to fortunate disciples in every direction,
O learned, skilful and noble lama, to you we pray.
When the time came for the enlightened aspiration and actions
Of the Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso to be fulfilled, it was through their spiritual link
That Lerab Lingpa, with his cycle of teachings,
Brought a wealth of auspiciousness to the people of the Land of Snows.
Even amidst the oppressive darkness of the five degenerations,
You perfected your study, contemplation and meditation on all the outer and inner piṭakas, and countless scriptures,
Reached the highest experience and realization of their meaning,
And stood out, as the supreme holder of the definitive teachings.
When the fierce winds of change blew with unbearable intensity,
Your determination and resolve remained steadfast like the king of mountains,
And those in saffron robes, upholders of the three trainings,
And devoted followers in their thousands, flocked around you.
Day by day, by means of study, practice and spiritual activity,
You fulfilled the deepest wishes of beings who came from far and wide,
And with a great Dharma rain of ripening empowerments and liberating teachings, vast and profound,
You planted the perfect seed of enlightenment within us all.
From the teachings of the śrāvakas up to Atiyoga,
You transmitted the scriptural traditions of all the vehicles,
Along with every drop of nectar from the pith instructions,
And satisfied the hearts of all your fortunate disciples.
How clearly we recall the maṇḍala of your perfect form,
How distinct the deep melody of your enlightened speech,
How vivid the knowledge and affection of your wisdom mind:
Remembering all your noble qualities, fervently we pray to you.
All of us who are your followers pledge
With unwavering effort, to apply faith, diligence and critical intelligence
To the wish-granting Dharma treasury of the nine vehicles,
And to devote ourselves, always, to the practice of contemplation and meditation.
Through the power of this prayer to you, our protector, may all your aspirations
Be perfectly realized, and so bring inspiration to beings throughout the whole of space,
And may we all never be separated from the teachers of the supreme vehicle,
So that we cultivate completely the qualities of experience and realization.
Through the vast and compassionate blessings of the lamas, yidams and ḍākinīs,
Through the power of interdependence, the nature of things, which is beyond all imagining,
And through the strength of unchanging and fervent devotion in both teacher and students,
May these aspirations come to pass, just as we desire!

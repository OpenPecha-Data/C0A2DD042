A Prayer to the Precious Teacher of Incomparable Kindness, Jamyang Lungtok Gyaltsen
Oṃ svasti
In the noble land of India, you were Śāntipa, lord of siddhas,
In Tibet, you were Drokmi Palgyi Yeshe, Langdro Lotsāwa,
Gyalwa Chokyang and others, guided and cared for by Padmasambhava,
Emanation of accomplished vidyādharas,
In this degenerate age, you appear as the emanation of Longchenpa, lord of the victorious ones,
And the glorious Longsal Nyingpo, in the form of a spiritual friend.
Praised and prophesied by vidyādharas of the past,
You transmit the teachings to beings the essence of the Dzogchen teachings—
Jamyang Lungtok Gyaltsen, root teacher, to you I pray!
Throughout the succession of all my lives to come,
May I never be separate from you, my sole protector.
Through vast, ocean-like activity of perfecting, maturing and purifying,
May the deluded perceptions of life, death and the bardo be purified into all-pervading space,
And may all beings come to experience the blissful land of Sukhāvatī!

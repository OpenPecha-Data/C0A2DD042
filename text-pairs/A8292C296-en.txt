Wondrous Light of the Moon A Prayer for the Swift Appearance of the Supreme Tulku of Vajradhara Jamyang Loter Wangpo
Vajradhara who possesses the five wisdoms of the four kāyas,
Heruka guide for whom all three seats are complete,
Vajrasattva, the lord whose presence extends to oceanic maṇḍalas—
The one who is inseparable from them all, glorious guru, to you I pray.
Treasure of knowledge with the intelligence of Mañjuśrīghoṣa,
Stream of compassion indivisible from the Holder of the White Lotus, 1
And hidden treasury of the wisdom mind of the Lord of Secrets 2 —
The one who embodies them all, glorious guru, to you I pray.
Emanate swiftly now, out of the dharmadhātu realm of Vajrayoginī,
In a supreme nirmāṇakāya form and return to this Land of Snows
To bring those students to be trained, such as myself, to maturity
Through a continuous stream of the four utterly pure empowerments.
Through the power and blessings of Mahākāla who blazes in splendour,
May we enjoy perfect victory over all obstacles and the forces of Māra,
And may everything be auspicious so that the Buddhist teachings in general
And your own tradition of vast loving care spread unto the farthest reaches of this world.

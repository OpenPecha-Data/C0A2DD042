Great Clouds of First-Portion Offerings for Prosperity
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ! Before me in the sky, amidst a white cloud of nectar
Is the wish-fulfilling jewel who increases prosperity,
Gesar, great king of the dralas,
Surrounded by Magyal and the rest, terma lords and wermas.
This great gathering of the necessities of life, all that one could ever need of food, drink and wealth,
As a source of the wisdom nectar fulfilling all that one desires,
This sublime and blessed offering
We offer to you, Supreme Being, Norbu Dradül Tsal, together with your retinue;
You see clearly and distinctly the whole of phenomenal existence without exception;
Whether high or low, or in between, you hold all beings with your love.
Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, you grant all of our desires.
To your hosts of wermas, fulfillers of wishes, we offer praise.
Think of us with compassion, lord of the mighty dralas,
From the depth of your infallible and steadfast jewel-like wisdom mind,
With a great shower of whatever we might desire of prosperity, abundance, food and wealth,
May you fulfil completely all our hopes and expectations!

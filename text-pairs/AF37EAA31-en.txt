Light Offering Aspiration Prayer
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
May the light of this lamp become rainbow light,
Filling the sky, the earth and the space between,
And from this light may offering goddesses emerge,
Together with desirable gifts and sensory delights.
To the guru, chosen deities, and the Three Jewels,
And also the hosts of ḍākinīs and dharma-protectors,
I offer this lamp of the brilliant, clear appearance
Of real gifts and those imagined by the mind.
Through the merit of offering this light,
May the darkness of ignorance be dispelled!
May misdeeds, harms and obscurations all be purified!
May adversity and obstacles be overcome!
May my life-force and merit blaze forth!
May my qualities of experience and realization blaze forth!
May the Buddhist teachings long remain ablaze!
And may happiness and well-being blaze throughout the world!

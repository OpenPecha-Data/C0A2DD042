Prayer for the Long Life of Kyabjé Dodrupchen Rinpoche
Through the power of the ocean-like, unfailing sources of refuge,
May Jikmé Tubten Trinlé Palbar’s
Lotus feet remain indestructible and stable for hundreds of aeons,
And may he accomplish his vast purpose for the teaching and for sentient beings!

Guru Yoga of the Guru Mahāmuni
Namo śākyamunaye!
The impure environment and inhabitants are purified into non-referential emptiness.
Out of the state of emptiness appears a perfect realm,
Vast, expansive and magnificently arranged.
In its centre, from a syllable Hūṃ arises a jewelled palace,
In the middle of which, upon a lion throne, lotus and moon,
Is a syllable Mu, golden in colour, which transforms
Into the Guru as the great blessed one Śākyamuni.
He is the colour of gold and blazes with the splendour of the signs and marks.
His right hand touches the earth while his left rests in equanimity.
He is elegantly garbed in the three dharma robes.
His two legs are crossed in the immovable vajra posture.
From the three syllables that mark his three centres,
Light invokes the wisdom deity, who dissolves inseparably into the samayasattva.
Supreme teacher, bhagavān, tathāgata, arhat, complete and perfect buddha, glorious conqueror, Śākyamuni, to you I bow. To you I pay homage.
In you I take refuge.
Grant your blessings, I pray.
Oṃ namo bhagavate śākyamuniye | tathāgatāya | arhate saṃyaksaṃbuddhaye | tadyathā | oṃ muni muni mahāmuni śākyamuniye svāhā |
Rays of light stream out from the three syllables at the three centres
Of the Guru, Lord of Sages, and dissolve into my own three centres.
They purify entirely all my physical, vocal and mental obscurations,
And grant the attainments of enlightened body, speech and mind.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Finally the guru melts into light.
And, as a luminous orb, gold in colour,
Dissolves into my own heart.
And in the merging of mind and wisdom, I rest.

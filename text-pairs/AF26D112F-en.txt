A Prayer to Parṇaśavarī
Noble and compassionate Bhagavatī,
Arise in the form of Parṇaśavarī, ‘Leaf Clad One’!
Do not abandon us, the people of this age of five degenerations,
But care for us with your compassion.
Carry out your incinerating activities to pacify, expel and destroy
Suffering caused by infectious disease, epidemics and plague!

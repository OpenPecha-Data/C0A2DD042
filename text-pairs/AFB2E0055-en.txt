Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
With a thousand rays, the wondrous expression of scripture and reasoning,
From the solar maṇḍala of the Sage’s teachings as a whole,
You cause the lotus gardens of teaching and practice to bloom in a hundred directions—
Sun of the teachings in the Land of Snows, may your life remain secure. 1
With the stable roots of your auspicious, wishing-tree-like form,
The nectarous rain of your excellent speech that cleanses the world,
And your wisdom and brilliance preeminent among hosts of the sublime,
May you remain, I pray, like a counterpart of the sun and moon.
May the buddhas and their heirs confer the nectarous empowerment of long life,
The vidyādharas and ḍākinīs sing melodious songs of auspiciousness,
And mighty guardians crush opposing and obstructing forces to dust,
And may the light of everlasting virtue and excellence shine!

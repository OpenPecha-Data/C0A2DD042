Supplication to Lord Buddha together with the Sixteen Arhats
Oṃ svasti prajebhyaḥ
Lord of the ten strengths, victorious Ādityabandhu,
Together with your entourage of regents, the Arhats,
Cause the amṛta-light of your blessings to radiate throughout the world,
So that the lotus of well-being and happiness forever blooms.

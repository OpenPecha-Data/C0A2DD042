Virtuous Adornment for All the World Verses to Bring Auspiciousness and Wellbeing
The body of the victorious ones, entirely perfect like a wish-fulfilling jewel,
The speech with sixty melodious tones of Brahma, like a magnificent drum,
And the wisdom mind that is deep and hard to fathom like a pristine ocean—
Through the boundless qualities of these three secrets, may all be auspicious!
Perfect Buddha, complete with all qualities of freedom and maturation and the three kāyas,
Sacred Dharma, cooling tranquility that protects from the torment of the two obscurations,
And Saṅgha assembly, revealers of the path to liberation who possess knowledge and liberation—
Through the compassion of these Three Supreme Jewels, may there be the auspiciousness of the sublime white parasol.
The guru, face and embodiment of all the victorious ones, in whom cloud-like blessings gather,
Peaceful and wrathful yidam deities, who bring down rains of twofold attainment,
And hosts of ḍākinīs, who provide the fruit of all that is wished for and required—
May there be the auspiciousness of these Three Roots together with the oath-bound guardians.
Red Tārā, magnetizing goddess with the power to attract the three realms,
Vaiśravaṇa, bestower of abundant wealth, merit and good fortune,
And Tārā, Sublime Lady of Immortality, goddess who grants longevity—
Through their auspiciousness may you have happiness and wellbeing here and now.
May these harmonious verses of auspiciousness,
Arisen from the resonant drum of the throat,
Bring every excellence of the mightiest of gods and his heirs
From throughout the whole of existence and peace.

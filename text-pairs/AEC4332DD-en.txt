Brief Dharmapālas Offering
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Instantaneously perfect as soon as I think of it, in front of me, upon a tripod of skulls.
A ‘single piece’ skull-cup containing
The substances of union and liberation, such as the five meats and five nectars.
Through the miraculous display of projecting and absorbing, the essence of the three secret aspects of the buddhas
Is invoked and becomes one with the materials of the torma.
The substances of the offering torma, which are unstained by the defilements of grasping them as real, and are
Rich with glorious qualities, outer, inner and secret:
To the Three Jewels, the Three Roots and the protectors of the sacred commands and Dharma protectors in general, and
Especially to Ekajaṭī, the protectress of the tantras
The Glorious Lord Maning, with the hosts of male protectors,
Vajrasādhu, the liberating kiṃkara, with your retinues,
The great Zadü—Rāhula—with your retinue of the eight classes and animal headed sisters.
Durtrö Lhamo, with your eight brothers and sisters,
The five sisters of long life, Yudrönma and the twelve tenmas
The eight classes of outer, inner and secret devas and rakṣasas,
Together with your various emanations and retinues, to you
I present these offerings, praise, fulfilment offerings and glorification:
Be pleased and satisfied, and purify our transgressions,
Bestow the accomplishment of infinite enlightened actions, whatever we have requested, and
Now and in the future, may we follow the path of virtue and attain buddhahood!

Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī
He was residing there together with a great saṅgha of eight thousand monks
Ānanda inquired
and with twelve thousand bodhisattvas from various buddha realms
and thirty-two thousand gods, who had all genuinely entered into unexcelled and perfect awakening
Youthful Mañjuśrī and the god Ratnavara had also joined the gathering and were present there
Ratnavara at that time thought to himself
“If the Blessed One encourages youthful Mañjuśrī to teach the Dharma
The Blessed One declared
He will teach so that all opponents are defeated
“Ānanda, you should remember this Dharma teaching as The Teaching on the Indivisible Nature of the Realm of Phenomena
You should also remember it as The Inquiry of the God Ratnavara
and so that those possessed of excessive pride will become free of their pride and reveal their knowledge
he will surely teach so that all the abodes of the māras will be subdued and Māra the evil one will despair
You should also remember it as Youthful Mañjuśrī’s Instructions.
He will teach so that those engaged in yogic practices will achieve their fruition
When the Blessed One had spoken these words, venerable Ānanda
and so that those who have already achieved fruition will gain further distinction
In this way the lineage of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha will continue unbroken so that numerous beings will arouse the mind set on awakening
the teaching of the Dharma will cause those who hear it to pass quickly beyond suffering by means of whichever vehicle may inspire them
This was translated, edited, and finalized by the Indian preceptors Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi and the translator-editor, the venerable Yeshé Dé
In response youthful Mañjuśrī inquired
“Blessed One, where should I begin my teaching?
and his bodhisattva saṅgha will consist of six hundred million ordained bodhisattva
and innumerable bodhisattvas living as householders
The awakening that the Thus-Gone One has gained over incalculable eons will long remain and expand
Whether the Thus-Gone One remains or passes entirely into nirvāṇa
“When the Thus-Gone One Ratnavyūha teaches the Dharma to the bodhisattvas of that realm he will ascend into the sky to a height of eight hundred million palm trees
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, childish and ordinary beings are stricken by the errors of the view of the transitory collection
In those who persist in the belief in ‘I’ and ‘mine’ there arises the conception of self and other
Mañjuśrī replied
“As those sounds are heard throughout the buddha realm, the bodhisattvas will receive a Dharma teaching in the form of a dhāraṇī gateway known as the inexhaustible gateway
With the aggregate of discipline, it is guarded in all respects
Never does it abandon the lineage of the noble ones, nor does it ever spoil the vow of the mind of awakening
“Mañjuśrī,” he said, “you say that all phenomena are the nature of the realm of phenomena
It does not pursue gain and honor, nor does it pander to others
But within the nature of the realm of phenomena there is no affliction
With the aggregate of absorption, this mind does not dwell anywhere
nor is there purification. How is it, then, that sentient beings get afflicted, or purified?
With the aggregate of insight, this mind is liberated
It guards itself for the sake of guarding others
At that point the venerable Śāradvatīputra addressed youthful Mañjuśrī
Being certain of its own intentions, it does not seek the mistakes of others
Observing discipline, it is free from all fears
Without being tightfisted, it shares the Dharma
It protects the mental activities of all beings
At the beginning it precedes all virtuous dharmas
So, Blessed One, how could I begin my teaching with the nature of the realm of phenomena?” The Blessed One said
“Mañjuśrī, if those who are possessed of excessive pride hear that teaching, it will frighten them.
Experiencing all phenomena as of one taste, it is beyond differences with respect to activity
What is that dhāraṇī gateway of the inexhaustible gateway
Having conquered all forms of conceit, it is free from conceit
“In the discernment that there is no birth, it intentionally takes birth in order to ripen sentient beings
and in the discernment that all phenomena are empty from the beginning, too, it also ripens sentient beings so as to subdue all views
While acting in full acquaintance with the absence of marks, it nevertheless considers all sentient beings who engage with marks
Without any wishes, it nevertheless perfects all aspirations for the sake of omniscient wisdom
It teaches the definitive understanding of phenomena and is a gateway to the comprehension of all phenomena
In the discernment of the absence of formations, it is nevertheless insatiable in forming roots of virtue
Since it sees entities as nonentities, it comprehends both entity and nonentity
It teaches the pacification of all phenomena and is a gateway to connecting with the way all phenomena are
Leading sentient beings to the absence of self, it knows the self to be without self
Free from any concerns, it does not keep anything in mind
Relinquishing affliction while not relinquishing sentient beings, it is both relinquishing and non-relinquishing
Cultivating skillful means and insight, it is peaceful beyond both peace and lack of peace
It teaches how phenomena are free from evil and is a gateway to genuine exertion with respect to all phenomena
Would it not be wonderful were youthful Mañjuśrī to deliver such a teaching!” The Blessed One knew in his mind what the god Ratnavara was thinking, and so he said to youthful Mañjuśrī
In distinction from hearers and solitary buddhas, it proceeds without proceeding
Beyond the paths of the māras, this is the path of no path
It teaches the light of insight concerning phenomena and is a gateway to illuminating all phenomena
In distinction from childish, ordinary beings, this is the activity of non-action
“Mañjuśrī, the gathering here wishes to hear the Dharma from you. Therefore, please go ahead and speak some words to those who are gathered here.
As it understands all phenomena, it is sameness that neither raises things up nor puts them down
It teaches the absence of difference among phenomena and is a gateway to the sameness of all phenomena
Without any conceited superiority over others, it does not make proclamations regarding itself
Perfecting all the qualities of a buddha, it is an unequaled understanding
“It teaches the absence of distraction with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to tranquility with regard to all phenomena
“Mañjuśrī,” replied the Blessed One, “you should begin by teaching the nature of the realm of phenomena.
Accepting all phenomena as unborn and unceasing, it is the acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena
Divine being, such is the knowledge of bodhisattvas
“Divine being, being unborn and unoriginated is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
It teaches the absence of conflict with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to special insight with regard to all phenomena
“But Blessed One,” replied youthful Mañjuśrī, “all phenomena are the nature of the realm of phenomena. Hence, Blessed One, the nature of the realm of phenomena cannot possibly be a topic of discourse or study
“Those who become afraid,” said Mañjuśrī, “are themselves of the nature of the realm of phenomena, and the nature of the realm of phenomena does not become frightened.
It teaches the non-disturbance of phenomena and is a gateway to the ascertainment of all phenomena
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds embrace birth within cyclic existence and perfect the qualities of a buddha
“Being despondent and free from desire is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
It teaches the absence of forgetfulness with regard to phenomena and is a gateway to the recollection of all phenomena
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds take delight, supreme delight, in correctly knowing the qualities of a buddha
It teaches the understanding of the meaning of phenomena and is a gateway to the understanding of all phenomena
In those who conceive of self and other there arise a virtuous and unvirtuous mind and the mental states that arise from it
“Being without connection to future existences is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like. Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds know the way to take birth
It teaches the mind’s purity with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to intelligence concerning all phenomena
“A complete severance is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
that mind and the factors arising from it then condition the formation of virtuous and unvirtuous actions
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds are a continuity of roots of virtue
and for them, that cause and those conditions bring about their particular forms of ripening according to their particular natures
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, for as long as such beings take birth within the realms of existence, that is what we call affliction
“A lack of concern for the roots of virtue is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds are insatiable for the roots of virtue
It teaches the way to conquer all the various views about phenomena and is a gateway to the emptiness of all phenomena
“Relinquishing the process of taking birth within the three realms is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds knowingly take birth to ripen sentient beings
It teaches the peace of phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of marks with respect to all phenomena
“Eliminating only their own afflictions is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
“However, venerable Śāradvatīputra, affliction is the very nature of the realm of phenomena
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds work diligently to eliminate the afflictions of all sentient beings
“Acting for themselves is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Hence, to know that affliction is indeed the very nature of the realm of phenomena is what we call purification
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds act to pacify the suffering of all sentient beings
“It teaches the elimination of all transmigration with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of wishes with respect to all phenomena
“Leaving anyone uncared for is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Ultimately there is no affliction or purification and nothing is afflicted or purified.
It teaches the lack of formation of phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of formation with respect to all phenomena
When youthful Mañjuśrī gave this teaching, one hundred proud monks liberated their minds from defilement with no further appropriation
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds reach out to ripen sentient beings
“Exhausting desire, anger, bewilderment, and affliction is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
It teaches the lack of establishment of phenomena and is a gateway to the non-arising of all phenomena
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds have complete knowledge of desire, anger, bewilderment, and affliction
Venerable Śāradvatīputra then said to youthful Mañjuśrī
“Actualizing the qualities of cessation is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds have complete familiarity with cessation
“Exhausting defilements is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
“Mañjuśrī, as you gave this teaching, one hundred proud monks liberated their minds from defilement with no further appropriation
Mañjuśrī, the realm of phenomena is flowing from you!
Mañjuśrī said, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, what do you think? Is the nature of the realm of phenomena something that was bound in the past and later liberated?
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds are familiar with defilement by means of roots of virtue
“Mañjuśrī, the nature of the realm of phenomena was not bound in the past, nor is it later liberated.
It teaches the non-dual nature of all phenomena and is a gateway to the non-occurrence of all phenomena
“Actualizing the three gateways of liberation is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
“Well, venerable Śāradvatīputra, from what mind state were those monks liberated?
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds are familiar with the three gateways of liberation
“Putting down the load of the five aggregates is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
“Mañjuśrī, the Thus-Gone One has trained many hearers, and so their minds are liberated from defilement with no further appropriation.
It teaches non-conceptuality regarding phenomena and is a gateway to freedom from desire for phenomena
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds cause all beings to put down their loads
“Blocking the six faculties is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds know all the different faculties of beings, whether superior or not
“Bringing an end to birth is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds engage in the process of taking birth
“Attaining the result that is the liberation of hearers and solitary buddhas is not what bodhisattvas’ minds are like
Rather, bodhisattvas’ minds sustain all beings with the result of liberation at the seat of awakening.
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the characteristic of past mind is that it has ceased
the characteristic of future mind is that it has not yet occurred
and the characteristic of present mind is that it does not remain
That being so, venerable Śāradvatīputra, in which of these is that liberation of your mind?
Venerable Śāradvatīputra replied, “Mañjuśrī, this mind was not liberated in the past, is not being liberated at present, nor will it be in the future.
When Mañjuśrī delivered this section of teaching on the revelation of correct knowledge, ten thousand beings within the gathering gave rise to the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening
It teaches the direct cognition of phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of constructs with respect to all phenomena
The Blessed One also expressed his approval to youthful Mañjuśrī, saying, “Well said, Mañjuśrī, well said
You have explained the bodhisattvas’ revelation of their knowledge well
It teaches how all phenomena are free from duality and is a gateway to the non-duality of all phenomena
Mañjuśrī, any bodhisattva who hears this teaching on the revelation of knowledge and is inspired, fearless
It teaches the immutability of all phenomena and is a gateway to the baseless nature of all phenomena
“It teaches the sameness of sentient beings pertaining to phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of sentient beings pertaining to all phenomena
is unafraid and does not panic will awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and reveal the correct knowledge of the thus-gone ones.
It teaches the unchanging nature of phenomena and is a gateway to non-doing with regard to all phenomena
It teaches the absence of activity with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to the non-appropriation of all phenomena
It teaches how to crush the ground of phenomena and is a gateway to the groundlessness of all phenomena
It teaches the absence of concerns with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to certainty about all phenomena
It teaches how to accomplish the fruition of phenomena and is a gateway to the cause of all phenomena
“It teaches the lack of forgetfulness of phenomena and is a gateway to diligence with respect to all phenomena
Ultimately there is no bound or liberated mind to be observed.
“Divine being, the blessed buddhas teach the Dharma by means of the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomena
“Mañjuśrī, within the nature of the realm of phenomena neither the relative nor the ultimate can be observed.
It teaches the absence of aggression with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to the deliverance of all phenomena
It teaches the unmistaken suchness of phenomena and is a gateway to the suchness of all phenomena
“Mañjuśrī, is there, then, never any mind that is liberated at all?
Mañjuśrī asked him, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, how, then, can you declare that the mind is liberated in relative terms?” So Śāradvatīputra asked
It teaches the indivisible nature of phenomena and is a gateway to the limit of reality of all phenomena
do they then teach the Dharma?” Mañjuśrī said
It teaches the one taste of phenomena and is a gateway to the realm of phenomena of all phenomena
However, venerable Śāradvatīputra, there is no mind to be observed inside, outside, or in between
It teaches the sameness of the three times with regard to phenomena and is a gateway to the actual state of all phenomena
“But how, Mañjuśrī
and therefore there is no bondage or liberation whatsoever.
The god asked
“But Mañjuśrī, have you not gained or realized anything from following those blessed buddhas who are more abundant than the number of grains of sand in the River Ganges?
But, divine being, since I have not attained or relinquished anything, what sort of knowledge could I reveal?
It teaches non-attachment to the sounds and verbal expressions associated with phenomena and is a gateway to the inexpressible nature of all phenomena
At that point two hundred monks from that retinue heard this teaching by Mañjuśr
and rose from their seats, getting ready to leave
Mañjuśrī replied, “Divine being, had I attained or relinquished something I might also reveal knowledge
“It teaches the pacification of all phenomena and is a gateway to the concentrations that pertain to all phenomena
It teaches the absence of a person with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to the reality of all phenomena
They said, “If nobody was ever liberated and nobody ever will be
what is the point of our going forth and taking vows to become monks
It teaches the understanding of the sameness of phenomena and is a gateway to the awakening of all phenomena
Divine being, this is how the blessed buddhas teach the Dharma.
The god asked, “But Mañjuśrī, if the blessed buddhas do not teach the Dharma for the sake of the transcendence of suffering, then why do they appear?
Divine being, the buddhas appear in order to reveal the essential nature of ignorance and craving within existence
Divine being, the buddhas appear for the sake of the realization of the essential nature of desire, anger, and delusion
In this way, Ānanda, without arising from the center of space, the Thus-Gone One Ratnavyūha will teach the bodhisattvas these dhāraṇī gateways known as ‘the inexhaustible gateway,’ doing so in an elaborate and genuine manner
Divine being, the buddhas appear in order to show that the nature of error is sameness
Thereby bodhisattvas beyond number and count will gain acceptance.
Divine being, the buddhas appear so that all features of the various views may be realized
Divine being, the buddhas appear in order to reveal that the essential nature of the aggregates, elements, and sense sources is the realm of phenomena
Venerable Ānanda then exclaimed to the Blessed One
Divine being, the expression ‘the buddhas appear’ is a reference to all phenomena being unborn
then what purpose would there be in our going forth, and why should we have taken vows to become monks
Where no phenomena at all are born, there is neither any cyclic existence nor any transcendence of suffering.
Why? Because the appearance of the buddhas does not benefit anyone.
Hence, I have left the gathering.” The two hundred monks concurred
The Blessed One responded
“Ānanda, this wisdom of the thus-gone ones, spontaneously accomplished and beyond formation, which unimpededly perceives all phenomena of the past, future, and present, is indeed unique.
Venerable Ānanda then turned to the god Ratnavara with the following words
“Divine being, the Thus-Gone One has prophesied your awakening to true and perfect buddhahood. You have gained something excellent.
“No, Mañjuśrī, I do not
The god replied
“Venerable Ānanda, nothing can be observed to which any such prophecy could apply
How is that
Form is not the bodhisattva, and hence form is not something that can receive a prophecy
“We do not wish to be present at Mañjuśrī’s Dharma teaching, either
“Divine being,” declared Mañjuśrī, “according to your contention, neither benefit nor harm can be observed with respect to the unconditioned.
We do not understand it, we are not interested in it, and we do not believe in it. Therefore, we have also left the gathering.
The god said, “Mañjuśrī, you should not deliver this Dharma teaching when beginners are present
Why would I say so
Addressing the two hundred monks, the emanated monk asked them
Because if they hear it, they will become frightened, and when frightened they will regress.
Mañjuśrī replied, “Divine being, the fear and regression of beginner bodhisattvas abide within irreversibility itself.
“What were the disagreeable points in youthful Mañjuśrī’s Dharma teaching that made you leave the gathering?
Neither are feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness the bodhisattva. Therefore, they also cannot receive any prophecy
The earth element is not the bodhisattva, and hence it does not receive any prophecy
The elements of water, fire, and wind are not the bodhisattva either, and therefore those elements also do not receive any prophecy
Just as the eyes are not the bodhisattva and therefore cannot receive any prophecy
The monks replied, “Venerable one, youthful Mañjuśrī declared that nobody ever achieves anything
and that there is no such thing as gaining realization and liberation. At that point we thought
“Where do you come from, venerable one?
The events of the past, future, and present are not the bodhisattva, and therefore the three times cannot receive any prophecy
Causes and views are not the bodhisattva. Therefore, causes and views cannot receive any prophecy either
“Venerable ones,” he replied, “I do not wish to participate in the Dharma teaching that youthful Mañjuśrī is now giving
I do not understand it, I am not interested in it, and I do not believe in it
Arising and disintegration are not the bodhisattva, and hence arising and disintegration cannot receive any prophecy
“Venerable Ānanda, the term bodhisattva is a designation that functions as a basis for communication
That, in turn, is the basis for peace
That which is at peace cannot in any way be prophesied
When they encountered the emanation, the monks asked him
With a well-trained mind, it is noble
Having conquered pride, it takes delight in the Dharma
Venerable Ānanda, the term prophecy is a synonym for the fact that no phenomena can be grasped
Without intention, anger, fear, or bewilderment, it is immutable
“Having cut through all mental constructs, it is free from thoughts
Having relinquished mundane activities, it keeps few things
Not aiming for the three worlds, it has modest wishes
Content with the bare necessities, it knows no deceit
Venerable Ānanda, it is when bodhisattvas do not grasp any phenomena—whether inner or outer, virtuous or unvirtuous, conditioned or unconditioned—that they receive a prophecy
Having abandoned negative forms of livelihood, it does not take over others’ property
Content with what it finds, it does not search
Venerable Ānanda, the so-called prophecy for bodhisattvas is a declaration of the fact that no phenomena can be grasped at all
Since its discipline is flawless
it is free from all torments
The prophecy declares that it is impossible to grasp any phenomena
and is not involved with mistaken practices
Because of its complete inner purity, it is free from hypocrisy, and because of its purity with respect to speech, it knows no flattery
It is pure, having relinquished desire, anger, and bewilderment
Without needing direction, it comprehends all needs
The prophecy declares that all phenomena are devoid of abiding
It is assiduously careful and pursues the qualities of the buddhas
It is irreproachable with respect to the actions of body, speech, and mind
Why should we observe celibacy
“It adheres to noble beings and does not associate with those who are not noble
If there were no such thing as deliverance at all
The prophecy declares that all phenomena are unborn
what purpose would it serve to train on the path? It was with these thoughts in mind that we left the gathering.
It does not move toward objects
It engages with the thoughts of sentient beings
it engages with all phenomena without mediation
It does not move toward all the aspects of a view and does not project out to phenomena
The prophecy teaches the inconceivability of all phenomena; it shows them to be beyond thought
Venerable Ānanda, such is the prophecy for bodhisattvas.
It does not direct the mind to unvirtuous phenomena or pay attention to them but cultivates non-dwelling in any concentration or equilibrium
At this point the Blessed One expressed his approval to the god Ratnavara
“Excellent, divine being, excellent
It is indeed to bodhisattvas who realize such a teaching that the blessed buddhas prophesy awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.
and since they are also not confused with respect to feelings that are neither painful nor pleasant, they are not predisposed to ignorance
When they are no longer ravished by feelings, then this is their application of mindfulness to the observation of feelings
This is their application of mindfulness to the observation of the mind
“As they observe and dwell on feelings, their minds are not moved by any movement of their feelings about phenomena, and as their minds therefore do not dwell upon any phenomenon, they do not abandon, discard, or relinquish the mind of awakening
The Blessed One replied
This is their application of mindfulness to the observation of phenomena
“Pāpīyān, bodhisattvas are well known and acknowledged by gods and humans throughout the great trichiliocosm. This is why bodhisattvas receive such prophecies
“Divine being, bodhisattvas maintain their conduct by engaging in activities of desire in order to ripen those who experience desire, yet they do not dwell on the experience of desire
Hearers are not acknowledged among gods and humans and hence they do not receive this prophecy
Evil māra, when a bodhisattva receives the prophecy, numerous sentient beings will arouse the mind aimed at unexcelled and perfect awakening
Yet if a listener received a prophecy, that would not be the case
As for those sentient beings who have entered the Great Vehicle, they will become irreversible. That, too, is why bodhisattvas and not hearers receive a prophecy.
Mañjuśrī replied
Divine being, moreover, whenever a bodhisattva turns back or enters, he is an irreversible bodhisattva
Why is that? Because bodhisattvas return to the realm of desire and they enter the concentrations
Divine being, moreover, whenever a bodhisattva realizes what was not realized before and wholeheartedly refrains from dispute, he is an irreversible bodhisattva
Such a person is referred to as irreversible
They are the same due to the sameness of the realm of phenomena
They realize the domain of the realm of phenomena
They abide within the domain of the buddhas
Their realm is the same as the realm of all beings
Their voices are the same as the voices of all sentient beings
Their minds are the same as the minds of all beings
Their bodies are the same as the bodies of all beings
They understand the significance of causes and conditions coming together
They do not waver from or pass beyond the sameness of all phenomena
Divine being, this is what it means to be a bodhisattva who has only one birth remaining.
“Pāpīyān,” asked Mañjuśrī, “do you not rejoice in the prophecies of the bodhisattvas?
that has no appearance, is unimpeded, has no dwelling, and is imperceptible—do you think that it is to be observed as something that can be said to dwell inside
Moreover, by means of the three vehicles such a bodhisattva will deliver a limitless, countless, and boundless number of sentient beings from the three realms. Mañjuśrī, this thought brings me to despair.
Mañjuśrī replied, “Pāpīyān, whether you come here or not
you will not be able to create any obstacles for a bodhisattva who has set out with superior intent, who is endowed with skillful means, and who has departed by means of the perfection of insight
By the power of the Buddha, Māra Pāpīyān then asked Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, how does one set out with superior intent, how does one become endowed with skillful means, and how does one depart by means of the perfection of insight?
So the emanation continued, “If the mind has no form
cannot be shown, has no appearance, is unimpeded
“Pāpīyān, moreover, when a bodhisattva with superior intent dons the great armor for the sake of liberating all beings, such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intent
When a bodhisattva does not keep company with any of the afflictions, such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insight
“Venerable one, the mind does not have any form and it cannot be shown. It has no appearance yet is unimpeded. It has no dwelling and is imperceptible.
When a bodhisattva sees that all the afflictions and all the activities of the māras are aids to the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening, such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful means
The emanated monk then asked the group, “Venerable ones, the mind that has no form and cannot be shown
“Venerable ones, would you say that the mind is blue, or is it yellow
Or is it red or white
When a bodhisattva gathers sentient beings through the four means of attraction, such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful means
Or would you say that it is similar to the color of madder, or of a crystal
Is it real, or should we call it unreal
Is it permanent, or would you say that it is impermanent
“Well done,” said the emanated monk
“We just left because we did not like it
We did not reject the teaching, nor as we left did we say anything unpleasant.
Does it have a form
Moreover, divine being, when giving away all their possessions based on the superior intent of the mind of awakening, they are free from evil
When not involved in stinginess, they are irreproachable
When observing the ascetic practices, trainings, disciplines, and all the commitments, they are free from evil
without dwelling, and imperceptible
When not involved in flawed discipline, they are irreproachable
When not harboring anger toward anyone, they are free from evil
When a bodhisattva comprehends that the nature of all beings is the complete transcendence of suffering, such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insight
When not involved in the latent tendencies for covetousness and ill will, they are irreproachable
When they manifest the diligence that brings forth all roots of virtue, they are free from evil
When resting in concentration and attainment, they are free from evil
When they do not relish the blissful taste of concentration, they are irreproachable
When diligently pursuing the learning that leads to insight, they are free from evil
“Mañjuśrī, if Māra Pāpīyān, along with his armies
The god Ratnavara now said to Mañjuśrī
When not associated with misguided knowledge, they are irreproachable
When a bodhisattva fully understands that all phenomena are of the nature of awakening, such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insight.
“When not retaliating when hurt by others, they are free from evil
When not retaliating when wounded by others, they are irreproachable
When saying things as they are, they are free from evil
When acting accordingly, they are irreproachable
When at peace within, they are free from evil
When not stained by outer objects, they are irreproachable
When a bodhisattva gathers roots of virtue and dedicates them to omniscience, such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful means
When not having different views with respect to the mind of omniscience, they are free from evil
When not having any interest in the lesser vehicles, they are irreproachable
“Pāpīyān, moreover, when a bodhisattva sees a beggar and responds with appreciation rather than anger, such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intent
When recognizing the works of the māras, they are free from evil
When thwarting the works of the māras, they are irreproachable
When attaining illumination within the world, they are free from evil
When unstained by worldly qualities, they are irreproachable
When a bodhisattva relies on the meaning and not on words and letters, such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insight
“When not acting in conflict with what should be done, they are free from evil
When avoiding what should not be done, they are irreproachable
When free from pride, conceit, and arrogance, they are free from evil
It knows neither attainment nor realization
When in possession of perfect wisdom, intelligence, and the truths of the noble ones, they are irreproachable
When bodhisattvas are occupied with the wellbeing of others and set aside their own welfare, such bodhisattvas are endowed with skillful means
With steadfast resolve, they are free from evil
Venerable ones, it was with this in mind that youthful Mañjuśrī said, ‘Within the nature of the realm of phenomena there is neither affliction nor purification
When living by their pledges, they are irreproachable
Nobody ever attains anything; there is no realization and no liberation.’ 
When being in harmony with the way of dependent origination, they are free from evil
“Pāpīyān, moreover, when a bodhisattva cannot be turned back from the practice of engendering roots of virtue, such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intent
When not grasping at the phenomena of dependent origination, they are irreproachable
When the emanated monk had given them this teachin
When comprehending the empty nature of all phenomena by means of insight and wisdom, they are free from evil
When a bodhisattva considers the giver and the recipient to be the sameness of the limit of reality, such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insight
When skillfully gathering all roots of virtue, they are irreproachable
“When engaging in all activities by means of great compassion, they are free from evil
Venerable ones, the minds of childish and ordinary beings stricken by errors give rise to the belief in ‘I’ and ‘mine.
When abiding in liberation with respect to all phenomena, they are irreproachable
As they persist in that belief in ‘I’ and ‘mine,
When not observing any phenomena, they are free from evil
When teaching the Dharma for the sake of abandoning views that involve observation, they are irreproachable
When engaged in proper conduct without truly observing any phenomena they are free from evil
When manifesting the attainment of the fruition, they are irreproachable
When discerning the realm of phenomena to be empty, they are free from evil
When never giving up on any sentient being, they are irreproachable
When not dwelling in the three realms, they are free from evil
but when that observation ends, that mind will also end, disintegrate, and no longer remain
When not transcending suffering because of seeing sentient beings, they are irreproachable
“It is the observing mind that goes forth, takes vows, and becomes a monk
Yet the mind that practices the path has no intrinsic existence, is not real, and does not occur
He said that within the nature of the realm of phenomena there is neither affliction nor purification
the minds of the monks, with no further appropriation, were liberated from defilement
When a bodhisattva perceives all beings as worthy recipients of gifts, such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful means
With their minds liberated, they now returned to youthful Mañjuśrī
“Pāpīyān, moreover, when a bodhisattva is motivated by the superior intent of the mind of awakening and thereby gives away all possessions without concern for any inner or outer entities, such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intent
Covering themselves with their upper robes, they addressed him as follows
Divine being, someone who is free from evil and irreproachable is beyond words
That which is beyond words is inexpressible, and the inexpressible meaning is free from evil and beyond reproach
“Mañjuśrī, you have protected us
We have avoided giving up the Dharma and henceforth we will never relinquish the practice of the profound Vinaya Dharma.
Therefore, divine being, since bodhisattvas, who base themselves on the inexpressible meaning, emphasize their own minds
they are free from evil and beyond any reproach from noble beings.
Hearing this, venerable Subhūti asked the monks
When youthful Mañjuśrī had given this teaching, the Blessed One expressed his approval
“Well said, Mañjuśrī, well said
“What are your attainments, and what type of realization have you gained, that you now cover yourselves with your upper robes before Mañjuśrī?
You have explained well how bodhisattvas are free from evil and irreproachable
mounts, retinue, and realm, were placed in confinement, then they could not create any obstacles for the noble sons and daughters who have entered the Great Vehicle.
Mañjuśrī, when bodhisattvas become free from evil and beyond reproach in this way, the blessed buddhas prophesy their unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
Mañjuśrī replied
The monks replied, “Venerable Subhūti, we have neither attained nor realized anything at all
That is why we now cover ourselves with our upper robes before Mañjuśrī
At that time some gods within the gathering wondered
“When might the god Ratnavara awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood? What might his buddha realm be like
When Māra Pāpīyān heard these words, he attempted to become invisible and escape. However, due to the power of youthful Mañjuśrī, he was unable to become invisible and escape
“When will the god Ratnavara awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood? What will his buddha realm be like
Venerable Subhūti, when we had the sense of having attained something we rose from our seats and left the gathering
Now, free from that sense of attainment, we are here again.
“Venerable ones,” inquired Subhūti, “what makes you say this?
Venerable Subhūti, one who has neither any attainment nor realization has truly vanquished all forms of conceit.
“Ask Mañjuśrī,” they replied
So the venerable Ānanda now inquired
“Mañjuśrī,” said venerable Ānanda
“how can monks who have no such interest be seen to have excessive pride?” Mañjuśrī replied
“Venerable Ānanda, monks who conceitedly consider themselves pure because of their pure aggregate of discipline are excessively proud
You have the physical marks of a buddha and reside on a lion throne!
Know that those who have no interest in this very Dharma training are excessively proud.
Due to Mañjuśrī’s power, Māra Pāpīyān replied
Venerable Ānanda, whenever training occurs in that way, the training is genuine
and whenever hearers are trained, it is like being trained by an emanation
“Venerable Ānanda,” Mañjuśrī said, “these monks were trained by an emanation
Mañjuśrī, when even the Blessed One himself has not attained awakening, how could I possibly have done so
Mañjuśrī asked, “Venerable Ānanda, are all phenomena essentially like emanations?” “Yes, Mañjuśrī, they are,” replied Ānanda
Therefore, in that absence of desire there is no attainment and no realization. Awakening is an attainment of the unconditioned, and the unconditioned is characterized by no attainment
Awakening is characterized by the realization of emptiness, yet emptiness cannot truly realize emptiness
and so it will be that the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Ratnavyūha will appear in the world
Awakening is characterized by the absence of wishes, yet the absence of wishes cannot truly realize the absence of wishes
Awakening is the nature of the realm of phenomena, yet that nature cannot truly realize that nature
Awakening is characterized by indivisible suchness, yet suchness cannot truly realize suchness
the view of the transitory collection is itself emptiness. Nor are emptiness and the path two different things
Awakening abides within the limit of reality, yet the limit of reality cannot truly realize the limit of reality
the path is itself emptiness
Awakening is the essence of the lack of a self, a sentient being, a life force, a soul, a being, and a person. Therefore, it is not in any way something that can be fully realized
Mañjuśrī, moreover, bodhisattvas who hear this teaching on the characteristics of awakening without disturbing the characteristics of the essential nature of all phenomena should be declared to have awakened.
When the māra gave this teaching, five hundred bodhisattvas attained acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena
Venerable Śāradvatīputra then addressed youthful Mañjuśrī
“Moreover, venerable Ānanda, any monk who fears ignorance and the cravings of existence and relishes the taste of liberation from ignorance should also be seen as excessively proud
“Mañjuśrī, due to your power, Māra Pāpīyān now has the complexion and physical marks of a thus-gone one and resides on a lion throne, teaching such profound matters—what a wonder this is
Mañjuśrī replied
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, if I were to bless them in the same manner, even inanimate objects, such as the trees, grass, and forest here would display those features and teach the Dharma with the eloquence of a buddha
“Venerable Ānanda, some monks are frightened by desire, anger, and delusio
and relish the taste of the three gateways of liberation
Some are frightened by the four errors and hence relish the taste of the four perceptions
Some are frightened by the five obscurations and so relish the taste of the five faculties
and you would also teach the Dharma with the eloquence of a buddha.” At this point venerable Śāradvatīputra thought to himself
Moreover, venerable Ānanda, you should understand that monks who use emptiness to make the emptiness of the view of the transitory collection the same emptiness as the emptiness of the one path to be traveled are excessively proud
So those who do not engage correctly with such empty things because of their emptiness should be seen as excessively proud
“Those who are fearful of the view of the transitory collection and relish the taste of the one path to be traveled should be viewed as excessively proud
“If youthful Mañjuśrī were to transform me into the form and appearance of a buddha, a hearer would take the form of the Teacher, which would not be appropriate. I should therefore disappear from this gathering.
Such thoughts should be viewed as excessive pride
Thinking, ‘I have gained the attainments and achieved direct perception,’ they pride themselves on those achievements
There will be bountiful harvests, and it will be filled with gods and humans
Ānanda, the Pritivyūha world will be rich, vast, and delightful
It will know no unfree states or lower realms
Those who conceitedly think of themselves as pure because they have pure aggregates of absorption, insight, liberation, and liberated wisdom vision—such individuals should be seen as excessively proud
Some are frightened by the six sense sources and instead relish the six super-knowledges
Some are frightened by the seven bases of consciousness and instead relish the taste of the seven branches of awakening
“Ānanda, the humans of that realm will experience enjoyments comparable to those of the gods in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations
Some are frightened by the eight flaws and hence relish the taste of the eight-fold path of the noble ones
In that world food and drink will manifest simply by the mere thought of them
Knowing venerable Śāradvatīputra’s thoughts, Mañjuśrī now blessed Śāradvatīputra so that he appeared to the entire retinue in the form and appearance of a buddha seated upon a lion throne
Some are frightened by the nine conditioned entities and instead relish the taste of the nine successive attainments
Some are frightened by the path of action associated with the ten non-virtues and instead relish the experience of the ten qualities of no-more-training
“Now, venerable Śāradvatīputra, together with Māra Pāpīyān, please teach the Dharma, just like the Thus-Gone One does.
In that realm, ‘hearers’ and ‘solitary buddhas’ will be unheard of
Some are frightened by the conditioned elements and instead relish the taste of the unconditioned elements. All such monks should be known to be excessively proud
Venerable Ānanda, however much a monk is involved in boasting, conceit, construction
thoughts of something high, thoughts of something low
It is distinguished by an understanding of the non-duality of Dharma and non-Dharma
appropriation, relinquishment, conceptualization, dependence, clinging
They no longer entertain any notions, contemplation, views, or entanglements with respect to body, feelings, mind, or phenomena
and superimposition—that much will he be afflicted by excessive pride
Hence, venerable Ānanda, all such monks should be known as excessively proud
It is distinguished by the consecration of the wisdom of omniscience
It is distinguished by a realization of the mental conduct of all beings
“With their knowledge of phenomena actualized, they observe phenomena. At that point they are free from mindfulness and contemplation, and so they understand the intrinsic nature
It is distinguished by a realization of all entities and nonentities
It is not distinguished by the destruction of entities
“They understand all phenomena to be intrinsically non-arising and devoid of substance, like the essential nature of space
It is not distinguished by familiarization and the absence of entities
Still, it is not distinguished
yet also not undistinguished either
It is without movement, free from movement, and the interruption of all movement, and so it does not come or go.
Māra Pāpīyān then asked venerable Śāradvatīputra
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, what is the abode of the thus-gone ones?
Venerable Śāradvatīputra replied
“Pāpīyān, the thus-gone ones abide in the sameness of cyclic existence
Venerable Ānanda then asked youthful Mañjuśrī
“Mañjuśrī, how, then, is a monk who is not excessively proud?
Mañjuśrī replied
For the sake of ripening those who experience anger they engage in activities of anger, yet they do not dwell on the experience of anger
For the sake of ripening those who experience bewilderment they engage in activities of bewilderment, yet they do not dwell on the experience of bewilderment
“Mañjuśrī, what is an irreversible bodhisattva?
They abide in the absence of conceit because of the transcendence of suffering
They abide in the characteristics of the essential nature of all views
They abide in the abode of all afflictions
They abide in the true and fundamental abode of all phenomena
does not unite them in one
does not accept, does not reject
does not scatter
As this is their insight, through the nature of insight they understand awakening
Through the nature of awakening they understand the nature of sentient beings
Through the nature of sentient beings they understand the nature of all phenomena
and they also know that all phenomena are of the nature of the limit of reality
When asked, they reveal the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomena
This, divine being, is the bodhisattva’s revelation of his correct knowledge purified by means of the eye of insight
“Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas observe the body and apply mindfulness, they know that the body of the past was unborn
They know that the body of the future does not transfer
They abide in the abode of the non-duality of the conditioned and the unconditioned
And they understand that the present body is similar in essence to grass, trees, walls, rocks, or visual aberrations
They abide by not abiding within any abodes
When they observe the body, they understand that the nature of the body is non-arising, and so they do not instigate any contemplation that involves notions of the body
Pāpīyān, such is the abode of the thus-gone ones.
Again, venerable Śāradvatīputra asked Māra Pāpīyān
“Pāpīyān, how should one pursue awakening?
Māra Pāpīyān said
When a monk is like this, he does not harbor any excessive pride
Those who do not instigate contemplation will not dwell on any concerns
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, awakening is present at the root of the view of the transitory collection
‘defiled’ or ‘undefiled,
‘mundane’ or ‘supramundane,
“Awakening, venerable Śāradvatīputra, is to understand these phenomena correctly as they are.
At the beginning it precedes all roots of virtue
“Divine being, moreover, the correct knowledge of bodhisattvas is what causes them to assimilate the mind of omniscience
Among the gods who had faith in Śāradvatīputra and the gods who had faith in the factions of the māras, there were thirty-two thousand beings who aroused the mind set upon unexcelled and perfect awakening
to notice it, stabilize it, ensure that it is not lost, ensure that there is no distraction from it, and ensure that it is not forgotten
Hence, when asked, they reveal their applications of mindfulness through being free of mindfulness and conditioning
When this teaching was given, the minds of eight hundred monks were liberated from defilements without any further appropriation
This, divine being, is the bodhisattva’s revelation of his correct knowledge purified by means of the applications of mindfulness
Inclined to the disengagement of all phenomena, it is disengaged
Free from unvirtuous wishes, it is content
From various buddha realms in the four directions many thousands of bodhisattvas now arrived. Descending from the sky, they all gathered before the Blessed One, worshipping him by bowing their heads to his feet
“Blessed One, we heard this Dharma teaching on the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomena, so now we have come here to uphold the sacred Dharma
Blessed One, we shall uphold this Dharma teaching
We shall hold it, read it
and master it. So that the sacred Dharma may be upheld, we shall also teach it abundantly and correctly to others.
Addressing the Blessed One, venerable Ānanda asked
“Blessed One, from where have all these bodhisattvas come?
The Blessed One said
“Ānanda, they have gathered here from different buddha realms
All feelings have been interrupted
He is free from feeling, from all absence of feeling, from all perceptions, all thoughts, and all ways of directing the mind
He has no bondage and no appropriation. He is at peace, thoroughly at peace, utterly at peace
Since he has no thought of ‘I’ or ‘mine,’ he does not truly observe that there is any quality to relinquish, understand, or realize
Youthful Mañjuśrī ripened them and this Dharma teaching on the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomena has ripened them
Therefore, because of the gratitude and appreciation they feel for this Dharma teaching, they have come here to see the Thus-Gone One
pay homage to him, and venerate him
They have also come to venerate Mañjuśrī and rejoice in this Dharma teaching
Ānanda, after I have passed beyond suffering, these bodhisattvas will uphold the sacred Dharma by spreading this Dharma teaching in Jambudvīpa
Ānanda, these bodhisattvas are diligently upholding the sacred Dharma of many hundreds of thousands of buddhas.
At that time Śakra, Brahmā, and all the guardians of the world, who were present in the gathering, said
it goes without saying that he is without any conceit regarding his attainment, his understanding, or his realization. There is no basis for it
The Blessed One then expressed his approval to Śakra, Brahmā, and the guardians of the world
“Friends, it is indeed excellent that you will exert yourselves in this way to protect the holy beings who uphold the sacred Dharma
Those who apply themselves to upholding the sacred Dharma are worshipping the buddhas of the past, the future, and the present.
“Mañjuśrī, how should a bodhisattva who is free from pride reveal his knowledge?
The Blessed One then spoke to Mañjuśrī
In reply, Mañjuśrī explained
“Divine being, the omniscient mind, the mind that is equal to the unequaled, the mind that is superior to all of the three worlds, the mind that is entirely beyond the hearers and solitary buddhas—when bodhisattvas do not perceive that mind to be present inside, outside, or both
Mañjuśrī replied
It is with this in mind that the Blessed One has taught, ‘Space does not stick to the palm of one’s hand; so too, are a spiritual practitioner’s qualities.’
At that point the god Ratnavara inquired of youthful Mañjuśrī
When Mañjuśrī had given this teaching, two hundred monks experienced their minds’ liberation from defilement with no further appropriation
that is why he is not proud
Venerable Ānanda, any monk who becomes inspired in this way is known as truly and fully liberated
Without superimposing anything on phenomena, he understands that they are all the same in their very sameness, the very same just like space
Through the essential nature of all phenomena, they understand the essential nature of all roots of virtue
Through the essential nature of all roots of virtue, they reveal the essential nature of a bodhisattva
That which is not born and does not cease, does not in any way have a nature that can be blessed
This, divine being, is the bodhisattvas’ revelation of their correct knowledge
Blessed One, since no phenomenon can be blessed, their very essence is blessed
Nevertheless, Blessed One, in order that those noble sons and daughters, who revere the Dharma, who advance by means of the Dharma, and who are suitable vessels for such a profound discourse, may create roots of virtue, I request that the Thus-Gone One himself may bless this Dharma teaching
Blessed One, by all means, please grant your blessing so that all māras and opposing forces are overcome, so that there are no obstacles, and so that in the future this Dharma teaching will be practiced in Jambudvīpa.
At that point the Blessed One radiated a golden light from his body, which was so bright that it illuminated the entire great trichiliocosm
The Blessed One then said to youthful Mañjuśrī
“Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas, being physically at peace, understand that discipline is at peace
and being verbally and mentally at peace, understand that discipline is at peace
“Mañjuśrī, this light of the Thus-Gone One reaches everywhere. Just like that light, this Dharma teaching will also spread and pass into the hands of noble sons and daughters who have unimpaired knowledge and concern for the Dharma of the buddhas.
and being physically, verbally, and mentally at peace, understand that awakening is at peace
and as awakening is at peace, understand that all sentient beings are at peace
and as all sentient beings are at peace, understand that all phenomena are at peace
and as all phenomena are at peace, understand that the limit of reality is known as “at peace;
This, divine being, is the bodhisattvas’ revelation of their correct knowledge purified through generosity
and through the essential nature of all beings they reveal the essential nature of a bodhisattva
Through the essential nature of all phenomena they understand the essential nature of all beings
Through the essential nature of the limit of reality they understand the essential nature of all phenomena
“Ānanda, you should remember this Dharma teaching. You should hold it, recite it, and master it
You should teach it to others on a vast scale
Through the essential nature of giving they understand the essential nature of the limit of reality
for them, as the limit of reality is at peace, they are at peace, thorough peace, and utter peace
Hence, when asked, they reveal that all phenomena are at peace
This, divine being, is the bodhisattvas’ revelation of their correct knowledge purified through discipline
The bodhisattvas there will enjoy various Dharma delights, Dharma liberations, concentrations, absorptions, attainments, and miraculous manifestations
They will experience nothing but the best, highest, and most delightful Dharma joys; that is why this realm will be known as Pritivyūha, ‘Array of Joy.
With this inward disengagement, without moving outwardly they move to ripen others. Through the disengagement of their diligence they understand the disengagement of sentient beings
“Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas understand the teaching of disengagement from all contemplation and are free of superimpositions, their diligence will have equanimity and they will truly observe that whatever exertion they might undertake is itself disengagement
This, divine being, is the bodhisattva’s revelation of his correct knowledge purified through patience
When asked, they reply that because they understand the fleeting, momentary, and hollow nature of reality, they reveal their patience by not being moved
They thus understand also that all phenomena are of the essential nature of the limit of reality
and that the essential nature of awakening is the essential nature of all phenomena
that the essential nature of patience is the essential nature of awakening
They understand that the essential nature of all beings is the essential nature of patience
and without directing any aggressive contemplation externally they are patient regarding all the misdeeds of sentient beings
and patient without their minds being actuated externally or internally
“Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas practice concentration on all phenomena being the same and having no differences
they do not place their minds to remain in that concentration and make their consciousness dwell on it
Why is that
yet bodhisattvas do not disturb the characteristics of the realm of phenomena
Divine being, for the sake of ripening sentient beings the bodhisattvas engage with all the features of sentient beings’ experiences
gather the factors of awakening
uphold the sacred Dharma
“Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas see all phenomena through their pure wisdom by means of the eye of insight
they do not truly see any phenomenon
When they see in that way, in which they do not truly see any phenomena, there is nothing at all
Having attained an understanding of there not being anything at all, they do not move, proceed, or transfer anywhere
This, divine being, is the bodhisattva’s revelation of his correct knowledge purified through concentration
Through the sameness of all sentient beings they understand the sameness of all phenomena
They know that it is in this way that all phenomena are said to be the same
When asked, they reveal that, because they are all of just that sameness by nature, all phenomena are sameness
Through the sameness of awakening they understand the sameness of all sentient beings
Through the sameness of their concentration they understand the sameness of awakening
Without their consciousness dwelling on it they understand, through the sameness of mind, that concentration is sameness
“Divine being, genuinely abiding is to abide neither evenly nor not evenly.’
Free from concerns and with a consciousness that does not dwell, they train in observing the body and applying mindfulness to it, yet they neither cultivate nor eliminate any phenomena at all
“Having understood that all phenomena are without reality, they observe the body with the understanding that the mind that observes the body is also just like a magical illusion or an echo
With this insight they are neither attached to pleasant feelings nor hostile to painful ones
“Blessed One, why do you give prophecies to bodhisattvas instead of to listeners?
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, are you one of the Thus-Gone One’s hearers?
“I am, Mañjuśrī. I am one among the Thus-Gone One’s hearers.
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, is your mind free from appropriation and liberated from defilements?
“Indeed, Mañjuśrī, it is liberated.
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, was your mind liberated in the past, will it be in the future, or is it being liberated at present
Mañjuśrī responded
“Well then, venerable Śāradvatīputra, what is this liberated mind of yours?
Mañjuśrī, it is only in relative terms that a mind is said to be liberated
“Would you say that the nature of the realm of phenomena is relative or ultimate?
Śāradvatīputra, how, then, can you declare that the mind is liberated in relative terms
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, if there were a mind to be observed inside, outside, or in between, then there could also be a liberated mind
If there is no such thing as deliverance at all, then what purpose would it serve to train on the path?
Disapproving and disconcerted, they then left the gathering
Considering what ought to be done to train those monks, youthful Mañjuśrī projected an emanation in the form of a monk on the road in front of them
if nobody ever gains any attainment, realization, or liberation
The emanated monk asked the group
Venerable ones, did you simply leave because you did not appreciate what was being said
Or did you reject the teaching and express your displeasure in words
They replied
Venerable ones, to refrain from dispute is the foremost training for spiritual practitioners
Therefore, without saying anything offensive and without arguing against this teaching, let us try to follow it for a while
or would you say that it is formless
Or to dwell outside? Or to dwell in between
“No, it is none of these,” said the monks
if it is not to be observed inside, nor outside, nor in between
do you think it is real and established
“No, it is not,” answered the monks
“Do you then think, venerable ones, that a mind that is not real and not established can nevertheless be liberated?
Venerable ones,” the emanation continued, “now consider youthful Mañjuśrī’s teaching
they continuously engage with objects and abide on them. As such, a mind that arises from observation comes into being
And that which is nonexistent, unreal, and non-occurrin
knows neither arising, disintegration, nor remaining
That which neither arises, disintegrates, nor remain
cannot be bound and cannot be liberated
Venerable Subhūti, to speak of ‘attainment’ is boastful and conceited
And whoever is boastful and conceited has neither attainment nor realization
“Venerable ones,” asked venerable Subhūti, “who has trained you?
“Eminent Subhūti,” they replied
“we have been trained by him who has no attainment or realization, for whom there is no birth and no passing beyond suffering, and who is neither composed nor distracted.
“Mañjuśrī, who has trained these monks?
In reply Mañjuśrī explained
“Venerable Ānanda, these monks have been trained by one for whom there are no aggregates, no elements, and no sense sources; one who is neither an ordinary being, nor someone who trains, nor someone beyond training; one who is neither a hearer, nor a bodhisattva, nor a thus-gone one; one who has no body, no speech, and no mind; one for whom there is neither connection nor separation.
“What sort of teacher is that?
“Venerable Ānanda, what do you think
if the Thus-Gone One produces an emanation, is that emanation connected with something
“such an emanation would not be connected with any phenomenon, yet neither would it be separate from anything.
“Venerable Ānanda, are all phenomena essentially like emanations?
“Yes, Mañjuśrī, they are,
Because that emptiness by virtue of which the view of the transitory collection is empty is also the emptiness by virtue of which the single traversed path is empty
Because, venerable Ānanda, emptiness and the view of the transitory collection are not two different things
Because, venerable Ānanda, whoever engages in them with the perception that they are two things is not liberated
Venerable Ānanda, because all of that amounts to boasting, conceit, and construction
Because, venerable Ānanda, anyone who does not engage with emptiness—the emptiness that is the emptiness of the conditioned elements and the emptiness that is the emptiness of the unconditioned elements—as sameness must be known as excessively proud
Venerable Ānanda, a monk who, because he himself is at peace within, sees all outer objects as at peace—such a monk has no conceited ideas about ‘the same’ or ‘not the same,’ ‘knowledge’ or ‘ignorance,’ ‘perception’ or ‘non-perception,’ ‘the conditioned’ or ‘the unconditioned.
and does not cling
He truly observes that while all phenomena are the same as the limit of reality
they are the same through a sameness that is beyond being the same or being not the same, and as there is nothing whatsoever to be made the same or to be made not the same
he does not truly observe anything that is that sameness
He does not think, does not conceive, does not divide things in two
Hence, as he has no conceit, does not think, does not conceive, and does not cling
Venerable Ānanda, such a monk is free from excessive pride
For him, there is no remedy and no position
He is free of a position for himself and a position for others
When he understands the sameness of all phenomena by means of the sameness of the element of space
‘virtuous’ or ‘unvirtuous,
‘evil’ or ‘good,
‘conditioned’ or ‘unconditioned.
While not making such superimpositions, he will also not develop conceit about them
will not think them, and will not conceive of them, for he does not truly observe them
such bodhisattvas do not perceive any movement of the mind toward external objects or any abiding there
and yet their mind does move for the sake of accumulating roots of virtue, ripening sentient beings, and upholding the sacred Dharma
Thus their omniscient mind expresses itself to other sentient beings and to other person
while they understand that that mind, too, has the essential nature of the limit of reality
When asked, they reply that through the essential nature of their mind they understand the essential nature of all beings
Through the essential nature of all beings, they understand the essential nature of all phenomena
Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas, as they practice generosity, give by relinquishing the gift, the giver, the recipient, the context of giving, and the purpose of the gift, such bodhisattvas rely on nothing and do not remain fixed on anything
They have no attachment, do not hope for anything, do not focus on anything, and do not truly observe anything
When asked, they reply that they understand that the essential nature of giving is utter relinquishment, utter absence of goals, and utter emptiness
Divine being, moreover, when bodhisattvas understand the utterly fleeting, momentary, and hollow nature of reality
they are patient regarding all the woes that sentient beings may cause
Through the disengagement of sentient beings they understand the disengagement of awakening
Through the disengagement of awakening they understand the disengagement of all phenomena
Through the disengagement of all phenomena they understand the disengagement of the limit of reality
When asked, they reveal that their diligence is disengaged in just the same way as all those things are, by their nature, disengaged
This, divine being, is the bodhisattva’s revelation of his correct knowledge purified through diligence
Having interrupted all moving, proceeding, and transferring, they do not transmigrate; they do not transmigrate at all
It is because they have interrupted what sets transmigration in motion—desire, craving, and wishing
Without pursuing any desires at all
to ripen beings
they intentionally move through various births in orde
ensure the unbroken continuity of the lineage of the Three Jewels
They move without moving and without upsetting the characteristic purity of the nature of all phenomena
It is free from stinginess and relinquishes all possessions
It abandons attitudes of flawed discipline and in the aggregate of discipline it is without dwelling
It harbors no wish to harm any being, is free of strife, and inflicts no injury with body, speech, or mind
It does not practice the diligence of a listener or a solitary buddha but does undertake the diligence of the Great Vehicle
Now the god Ratnavara asked youthful Mañjuśrī
Mañjuśrī, do you reveal this knowledge
“Divine being, the blessed buddhas do not teach the Dharma for the sake of attainment and realization.
They do not teach the Dharma for the sake of no arising, no ceasing, no raising up, no putting down, no coming, no going, no sentient beings, separation from sentient beings, affliction, purification, cyclic existence, or the transcendence of suffering
Divine being, the buddhas appear so that the essential nature of the view of the transitory collection may be realized
Mañjuśrī, if that is so, then those sentient beings who don armor for the sake of unexcelled and perfect awakening have no need for that armor
Divine being, tell me, how is benefit differentiated
“Mañjuśrī,” replied Ratnavara, “benefit is differentiated through formation.
Divine being, do you then also claim that the thus-gone ones are subject to formation
Formation does not pertain to the thus-gone ones
They have discovered the unconditioned and are unconditioned, and formation is therefore not relevant to them
Mañjuśrī, what makes you say that
Divine being, frightened by the levels of the hearers and solitary buddhas, beginner bodhisattvas turn back from stinginess, flawed discipline, hostility, laziness, distraction, and misguided intelligence
That is how they genuinely abide within irreversibility
Mañjuśrī, what do you mean by ‘genuinely abide’
Mañjuśrī, how does a beginner bodhisattva abide
Divine being, when one rests in sameness by means of non-abiding within the sameness of the realm of phenomena—that is the abiding of a beginner bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī, when is one a beginner bodhisattva
Divine being, one is referred to as a beginner bodhisattva when, for the very first time, one becomes inspired by the Dharma of emptiness, the absence of marks, the absence of wishes, no arising, and no origination
Mañjuśrī, what is a bodhisattva with extensive experience
Divine being, childish and ordinary beings are the ones who have extensive experience, because the beginning of their cyclic existence cannot be observed
Mañjuśrī, how do bodhisattvas maintain their conduct
For the sake of ripening those who experience all the afflictions, they engage in activities of all of the afflictions, yet they do not dwell on any of the afflictions
Hence, when this is the case one maintains the conduct of a bodhisattva
Divine being, a bodhisattva who neither fears anything nor is attached to anything, an
who realizes the nature of the realm of phenomena by means of fearlessness and freedom from attachment—that is an irreversible bodhisattva
Because when the constituents of sentient beings, phenomena, and oneself, which were not realized, become directly perceptible, one becomes irreversible with respect to all phenomena
Without having to rely on the statements of others, one becomes free from hesitation, doubt, and uncertainty with respect to the qualities of a buddha
Hence one is stainless and pure from the beginning
In the absence of afflictions, the light of insight shines
one gains mastery with respect to all phenomena, and one actualizes all the qualities of a buddha. That is why one is referred to as irreversible
Mañjuśrī, what are bodhisattva great beings, who have only one birth remaining, like
Divine being, such bodhisattvas know all births to be devoid of birth and yet at the same time they know of the death and birth of all beings
For the sake of ripening sentient beings they display birth throughout all lives, accepting birth yet remaining free from appropriation
Free from appropriation throughout all births and lifetimes, such bodhisattvas are beyond death and birth
They know the thoughts of beings, are aware of time, and reach the ultimate seat of awakening
The god Ratnavara asked youthful Mañjuśrī
Mañjuśrī, what are bodhisattvas, who are free from evil and beyond reproach, like
Divine being, when bodhisattvas act by means of wisdom and not through pride, they are bodhisattvas who are free from evil and beyond reproach
When not involved in laziness, they are irreproachable
Divine being, moreover, as much as one makes use of words, reflects by means of words, understands by means of words, and is attached to words—that much one is at fault
Divine being, as much as one understands that all phenomena are beyond explanation, engagement, reflection, thinking, conception, and expression, and as much as one does not pass beyond suffering in order not to abandon sentient beings—that much one is free from evil and irreproachable
When they heard this teaching, five hundred bodhisattvas within the gathering gained acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena
The Blessed One also delivered a prophecy regarding their unexcelled and perfect awakening, specifying their individual buddha realms and declaring their names as thus-gone ones
And under what name will he attain awakening
Then, by the power of the Buddha, venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One
And under what name will he attain awakening
Ānanda, one hundred thousand eons from now, during the eon known as Ratnasaṃvara, in a world to the east known as Pritivyūha, the god Ratnavara will awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
Ānanda, in that world there will be no stones, pebbles, or gravel
The ground will be smooth like the palm of a hand and covered with three precious substances: beryl, crystal, and the gold of the Jambū River
Delightful to behold, it will be decorated with lattices of gold
The lifespan of the future buddha Ratnavyūha will be six hundred million years
There his crossed legs will cover the entire celestial world and he will shine hundreds of thousands of light rays throughout the entire buddha realm
A rain of divine flowers, incense, and colored powder will fall from the sky while the gods sing hundreds and thousands of songs accompanied by the sounds of big and small cymbals
It teaches the disengagement of body and mind and is a gateway to the disengagement of all phenomena
Blessed One, the wisdom of the thus-gone ones is spontaneously accomplished and beyond formation
They therefore possess a wisdom vision that unimpededly perceives all phenomena—whether past, future, or present. What a wonder this is
the same is the case with the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Name and form are not the bodhisattva, and hence name and form cannot receive any prophecy
When the Blessed One had spoken these words, Māra Pāpīyān appeared with his armies, mounts, and retinue
When they all had gathered at the site where the Blessed One was residing, Māra Pāpīyān addressed the Blessed One
Pāpīyān, why have you come to this assembly
Mañjuśrī, when the Blessed One prophesied that the god Ratnavara will fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and become the Thus-Gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Ratnavyūha
some words could be heard in my realm. From all my palaces with their windows and archways, from our jewel trees, and from all our delightful and enjoyable places, the following words rang out
The Blessed, Thus-Gone Śākyamuni has prophesied that the god Ratnavara will attain unexcelled and perfect awakening
More such prophecies will be given to other bodhisattvas. So, Pāpīyān, you should go there
Māra Pāpīyān replied
Mañjuśrī, if it were prophesied that all the inhabitants of Jambudvīpa were to become worthy ones, I would indeed rejoice. Bu
it is a different matter when even one single bodhisattva is prophesied for unexcelled and perfect awakening
Mañjuśrī, when a bodhisattva is given the prophecy of awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, all of my realms are threatened
Because a bodhisattva who has set out with superior intent, who is endowed with skillful means, and who has departed by means of the perfection of insight is truly beyond the paths of the māras
Pāpīyān, when a bodhisattva does not pursue any trifling activities at all, such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intent
Noble son, placing Māra Pāpīyān in confinement is not becoming for a bodhisattva
Noble son, instead I shall transform Māra Pāpīyān so that he will come to possess all the physical marks of a buddha, be endowed with supreme bliss, sit on a lion throne, and teach the Dharma with the eloquence of a buddha
At that point Mañjuśrī decided that the entire gathering should witness Māra Pāpīyān residing on a lion throne, adorned with all the physical marks of a buddha
Pāpīyān, you have attained the awakening of the thus-gone ones
Awakening is characterized by an absence of desire for attainment
Awakening is characterized by the absence of marks
yet the absence of marks cannot truly realize the absence of marks
However, due to Mañjuśrī’s power, he could not disappear
Hence venerable Śāradvatīputra, in the form and appearance of a buddha, said to Māra Pāpīyān, who likewise was present in the form of a buddha
Pāpīyān, how is the awakening of the thus-gone ones distinguished
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the awakening of the blessed buddhas is distinguished by a realization of the sameness of all phenomena
It must be pursued from ignorance, the bonds of craving for existence, the fetters of error, obscurations, and hindrances
Pāpīyān, what do you have in mind when you say this
It was for the sake of training those gods tha
youthful Mañjuśrī caused Māra Pāpīyān and the elder Śāradvatīputra to appear with the body and physical marks of a buddha
Now youthful Mañjuśrī withdrew his power
and the elder Śāradvatīputra and Māra Pāpīyān both resumed their usual form
Having all circumambulated him three times, they took their place in the gathering to one side
Sitting there, those bodhisattvas said to the Blessed One
Blessed One, we shall serve and venerate all holy beings, noble sons, noble daughters, and anyone else who upholds the sacred Dharma
We shall endeavor to protect them, guard them, and keep them from harm
Mañjuśrī, you must by all means bless this Dharma teaching, so that in future times it will be widely practiced in Jambudvīpa
for example, to bless the element of space so that it would not get scorched during the eon of fire
Similarly, Blessed One, since all phenomena are of the nature of the element of space, they are not subject to birth or cessation
The Blessed One said to venerable Ānanda
In that way you will be worshipping the blessed buddhas of the past, the future, and the present
Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teachin
and how should it be remembered
youthful Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva Ratnavara, the bodhisattvas who had arrived from all the various buddha realms, as well as the world with its gods, humans, demigods, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One

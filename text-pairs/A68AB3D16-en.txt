Short Tsok Offering to the Powerful Lady Kurukullā Remainder Aspiration
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ! The tsok substances of the five meats and five nectars,
The elixirs derived from the melting of the five wisdoms,
Are a treasury of perfect colour, smell, taste, and potency,
Sending out vast clouds of sensory delights.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ ha ho hrīḥ
Hrīḥ! Guru Amitābha, lord of the family,
Glorious and powerful yidam deity Hayagrīva,
And in particular the consort Kurukullā, chief of infinite ḍākinīs:
By thinking of you, all the abundance of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa
Is brought under our power.
Hundreds of thousands of ḍākinīs,
The consort—the great god Mahādeva—
Goddess Umadevī and all others
In the infinite magnetizing retinue:
Come here and enjoy this tsok offering!
With infinite clouds of sensory delights of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
This treasury as vast as the sky, may your wishes be fulfilled!
I confess my impairments, breakages, mistakes and downfalls of samaya!
Dispel all degenerations of the world and beings!
Bring all that is of benefit, all happiness and all good qualities,
Without impediment, under our power.
And in particular, move the heart channel of our object of focus,
Increase our lifespan, merit and prosperity,
And cause the four enlightened activities, the eight accomplishments, the ten powers,
And the ordinary and supreme siddhis to descend like rain!
oṃ guru-deva-ḍākinī-kurukullā-sarva-saparivāra-gaṇacakra-pūjā hoḥ | mahā-baliṅta khāhi |
Hrīḥ! Guardians of the priceless maṇḍala’s boundary,
Hosts of arrogant ones who own the remainder,
Come here and accept this tsok remainder of food and drink.
Carry out the activity entrusted by the yogis!
uccita baliṅ te khāhi
By making desirable offerings
To the gathering of magnetizing ḍākinīs,
Wind energy, mind and perception are brought under our power.
May we accomplish the wisdom of great bliss!

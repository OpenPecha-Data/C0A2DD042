Yarlha Shampo Sang Offering
Kye. Great local deity of the four ranges of Ü and Tsang,
Eighth level bodhisattva, guardian of the virtuous,
Great chieftain of all the local guardian deities,
Empowered in the maṇḍala of Chötö's haughty spirits,
You took on your commitment as leaders of the arrogant,
Shampo deities, male and female, together with your offspring,
And the hosts of attendants and emanated martial forces,
Come now! Accept these offerings of incense smoke,
Golden drink and various other excellent gifts.
Clear away degeneration, brighten the gloom,
Guard against all forms of harm and adversity.
Grant us the attainment of all that is favourable.
Guard dharma centres, temples, and hermitages,
Cause the teachings and their holders to prosper and flourish,
Bring joy and happiness to the people of this world,
And carry out the activities we entrust to you.
Destroy the deranged who harm the teachings,
Crushing them as if into dust.
Block the paths of the gyadré and [[gongpo] demons.
Elevate the status of the patrons of the teachings.
And carry out your activity, victorious over all.
Ki So Cha'o! Lha gyal lo!
All auspiciousness, splendour and wealth throughout existence and quiescence—
Gather them together like a flowing river.

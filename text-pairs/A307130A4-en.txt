May Buddha bring you happiness and well-being,
May Śakra and the Brahma gods as well 3
And all the worldly spirits too provide you
With happiness and well-being for evermore.
Through the Buddha's merit and power
And the intentions of the devas,
May whatever you wish for or desire
Be accomplished now upon this very day.
Two-legged creatures, may you be well.
Four-legged creatures, may you be well.
You who are on journeys, may you be well.
You who are returning, may you be well.
May the day be well and the night be well.
May the hours of noon bring happiness too.
May you always enjoy happiness and well-being,
And may you never fall prey to evil deeds.
Surrounded by thousands of gods,
The Buddha now approaches—
Let those who bear ill will be gone!
And compassionate ones remain.
Through the truthful words of the Buddhas,
Pratyekabuddhas, arhats and disciples,
Let all who would harm the world
Depart and be banished from this city.
All sentient beings, all living creatures,
All spirits, each and every one of you:
May you experience only happiness.
May you all be spared from sickness.
May you all encounter what is good
And never fall prey to what is evil.
May all the spirits gathered in this place,
Be it on the earth or in the sky,
Always show goodwill and kindness to all beings,
And practise Dharma day and night!

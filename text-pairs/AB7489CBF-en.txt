Prayer for the Spread of the Tradition of Pegyal Lingpa 1
May the tradition of the vidyādhara and tamer of beings, Pegyal Lingpa,
Magical manifestation of the wisdom of Padmasambhava and Nubchen, 2
Spread everywhere, throughout the whole of space and time,
And may goodness increase, bringing benefit and happiness to the teachings and beings.

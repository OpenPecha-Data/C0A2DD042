A Concise Supplication to the Most Noble Tārā
Oṃ. Noble Tārā, most compassionate and kind,
Your beautiful and radiant white form
Has captured my mind. I pray to you:
Protect me from the fears of sickness, spirit harm, enemies, disputes,
As well as those arising in the bardo;
Of saṃsāra in general and the three lower realms in particular.
Grant me longevity, physical and mental comfort and contentment,
The fulfilment of all my wishes,
Along with an increase of food, clothing, and enjoyments.
May I always act in accordance with the Dharma and,
Having beheld your face, Tārā, mother of all Buddhas,
May I become a child of the victorious,
Realize the enlightened intent,
And ultimately awaken—equal in fortune to all Buddhas.

The Verses That Saved Sakya from an Epidemic A Prayer for Quelling the Fear of Diseases
May every illness that preys on sentient beings’ minds
Caused by karma and incidental conditions,
Be it attacks by dark forces, disease or elemental spirits,
Never occur anywhere throughout this world!
May all the suffering of diseases that snatch life away,
Tearing body and mind apart in an instant,
Like the executioner who’s dragged his victim to their death,
Never occur anywhere throughout this world!
May epidemics , be they short-lived or enduring,
The very names of which strike terror equal
To that of falling into the jaws of Yama, Lord of Death,
Never cause harm to any living beings.
May eighty thousand classes of harmful obstructers,
Three hundred and sixty spirits who strike without warning,
Four hundred and four types of disease and more,
Never cause harm to any living beings.
May all the sufferings due to turmoil in the four elements,
That strip body and mind of every trace of well-being,
Be eliminated, granting us radiance, strength, and a long life,
Free from sickness, and endowed with inner peace and happiness.
Through the compassion of the gurus, Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha,
The power of ḍākinīs, Dharma protectors and guardians,
And the strength of the unfailing truth of cause and effect,
Let these prayers of ours be fulfilled, exactly as we wish!

Daily Practice of Guru Drakpo Taking Refuge & Generating Bodhicitta Visualization and Recitation Dedication and Aspiration
Namo! In the Guru, the Three Jewels, and the Yidam deity,
With the deepest devotion I take refuge.
So that I and all beings, as limitless as the sky, may reach unsurpassed awakening,
I shall practice Padma Drakpo.
oṃ svabhāva śuddhāḥ sarvadharmāḥ svabhāva śuddho ‘haṃ
Out of emptiness, instantly, from the syllable hūṃ
Upon lotus and sun-disc seats, trampling the gyalpo and senmo ,
I appear as Guru Drakpo,
Dark red in colour with one face and two hands,
His mouth gaping open, baring his fangs, with his three eyes open wide
He is looking sideways to the left as he revels in the nine expressions of dance,
His right hand raises a nine-pronged vajra
And his left hand holds a nine-headed scorpion.
He is ornamented by the charnel ground attire and
Majestically stands within an expanse of blazing wisdom fire.
On his head is Yamāntaka, in his throat Hayagrīva,
In his heart Vajrapāṇi,
At his navel the five classes of ḍākinīs,
At his secret place Yakṣa Mebal, 1 and above him soars a Garuḍa.
I clearly visualize these protective deities. 2
I imagine a red hūṃ in his heart resting upon a sun-disc,
Surrounded by the mantra-mālā.
Flames burst forth
From which forms of Guru Drakpo, mantra-garlands and mudrās emanate
To incinerate all illnesses, demons and spirits,
Like a fire blazing through straw,
And purify them into pristine basic space beyond reference.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ acik nicik namo bhagavate hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ | a hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ ||
a ya ma du ru ca śa na hūṃ phaṭ ||
Perception of the deity dissolves into the basic space of luminosity.
Then again, I arise in the deity’s genuine form.
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Through this merit, may I swiftly
Accomplish Padma Drakpo,
And bring every other being too
To that level of realization.

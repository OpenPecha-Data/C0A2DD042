A Daily Practice of Ucchuṣma
Namo!
In the lama, the Three Jewels and the yidam deity
With devotion, I take refuge. So that all beings, as infinite as space,
May attain supreme, unsurpassable awakening,
I shall meditate on Ucchuṣma.
From the state of emptiness, instantly,
Upon lotus and sun disc seats,
I appear as the great wrathful Ucchuṣma,
Dark blue in colour and emanating rays of light,
With two hands at my heart displaying the threatening mudrā,
And complete with all the attributes of a wrathful heruka.
Through the emanation and re-absorption of syllables at my three centres,
All the peaceful and wrathful ones are invited and dissolve into me.
At my heart upon a lotus and sun disc is a blue syllable hūṃ,
Surrounded by the mantra, whirling like a blazing firebrand.
As I recite the mantra, sparks of flame flicker and shoot out
To burn away completely all harm and breakages of samaya.
oṃ bhur kur mahāprāṇāya bhur ci bhur ki vimale ucchuṣma krodharāja hūṃ phaṭ
The outer and inner world dissolves into me,
And I too fade into the genuine state of clear light.
Then again, I arise in the form of the King of Wrath,
To protect against all adversity.
Through this merit, may I swiftly
Accomplish Ucchuṣma,
And bring every other being too
To that level of realisation.

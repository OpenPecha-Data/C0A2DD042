Daily Practice of Guru Rinpoche, Buddha of Medicine
Perfect in the instant of recollection,
I am the Oḍḍiyāna Buddha of Medicine—
Bright blue, holding supreme medicine and alms-bowl,
And wearing hat, undergarment, gown and cloak—
Resplendent with blessings and majestic presence.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padmasambhava bhaiṣajyarājasamudgate svāhā
Through this merit, may I swiftly accomplish the realization
Of Orgyen, Buddha of Medicine,
And may I bring each and every single living being
To that perfect state as well.

Verses of Auspiciousness
With the sun of the Buddha illuminating the three worlds,
The moon of Dharma dispelling the malady of conditioned existence,
And the jewelled light of the Saṅgha flooding the entire earth—
May the auspiciousness of the precious Three Jewels abound!
Through the auspicious guru, blessings gather like billowing clouds,
Through the auspicious yidam deity, siddhis descend like gentle rain,
Through the auspicious ḍākinī, grains of the four activities ripen—
May the auspiciousness of infinite, oceanic Three Roots abound!
The auspiciousness of dharmakāya is great emptiness, the sky of basic space,
In which the auspiciousness of sambhogakāya is radiant with the blossoming signs and marks,
And the auspiciousness of nirmāṇakāya emanates throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa according to what is required—
May the auspiciousness of the infinite Three Kāya realms abound!
When the great snow mountain of the protector Amitāyus
Is embraced by the compassionate moon of noble Tārā
The auspicious light of Vijayā expands and shines forth—
May the auspiciousness of the three deities of deathless life abound!

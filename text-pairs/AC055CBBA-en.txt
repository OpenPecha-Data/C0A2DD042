Prayer for the Flourishing of the Teachings
Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and the Lord of the Śākyas, Śākyamuni,
Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī and Vajrapāṇi, and Maitreya,
The sixteen Great Sthaviras,
And Padmākara—
Through your power and through your truth, may the lives of the masters be secure!
May the Saṅgha increase and dwell in harmony!
May all circumstances hostile to the teaching be pacified!
May the activities of study and practice grow and spread!

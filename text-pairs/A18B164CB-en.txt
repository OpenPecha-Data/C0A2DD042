Magnetizing Prayer
oṃ āḥ hūṃ hrīḥ
In the luminous dharmakāya space of unchanging primordial wisdom,
A realm where immaculate, self-arisen lights of five colours flicker,
Is the palace of the swirling lotuses of great bliss;
From which, moved by the intense love of boundless compassion,
Arise unimaginable, dance-like displays of illusory manifestation:
Amitābha, ‘Boundless Light’, the brilliance of discerning wisdom,
Padma Naṭeśvara, ‘Lotus Lord of the Dance’, master of all the world,
Mighty Hayagrīva, universal splendour of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Sublime Pema Gyalpo, ‘Lotus King’, who controls the three realms,
Guhyajñāna, ‘Secret Wisdom’, ḍākinī of great bliss,
Kurukullā, magnetizer of everything in existence and quiescence,
Saṃvara, king of desire who subjugates appearance and existence,
Red Mahākāla, passionate vajra, subduer of the arrogant hordes,
Great deity Gaṇapati, magnetizer of the triple world,
Wrathful Ṭakkirāja, captivator of the three realms,
Lord Mahādeva, progenitor of all the world,
Mistress of desire, playful emanation of every form of bliss and delight,
King Gesar, attractor of all that is good in existence and quiescence—
Three Root deities who have mastered the activity of magnetizing,
Heroic warriors who enjoy the secret play of bliss and delight,
Hosts of ḍākinīs who captivate the minds of all,
In your seductive guise of illusory bliss and emptiness,
Let your beautiful, impressive dance of form fill the whole of space,
Let the ceaseless melody of your speech pervade a thousand realms,
And the expressions of your bliss-empty awareness move saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
Wondrous deities of magnetizing activity,
Fervently I pray to you: consider me with your love.
Through the great blessing of basic freedom, pure and equal,
May my three doors be spontaneously perfected as the three vajras,
And the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa enter the sphere of great bliss.
Grant me supreme and ordinary siddhis for magnetizing appearance and existence, I pray.

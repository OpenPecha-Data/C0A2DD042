Prayer for the Long Life of Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti
May the life of the Dzogchen yogin Namkhai Norbu remain secure,
And may he turn the wheel of profound and secret Dharma.
May the experience, realization and qualities of fortunate disciples increase,
And may they attain Buddhahood in a single lifetime, to empty saṃsāra from its very depths.

The Sādhana of the Five Self-Arisen Noble Brothers: 1 An Instruction in the Union of Generation and Completion
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Out of the state of emptiness and compassion,
Seated upon a lotus and moon-disc, appears the white syllable hrīḥ .
From it, I appear as Avalokiteśvara
With one face and four arms.
On the crown of my head is Ārya Jamali, 4
Dark blue in colour, in his right hand a lotus,
His left hand in the mudrā of granting protection. 5
In my throat is Ārya Vati, 6
Red in colour, holding a lotus and granting protection.
In my heart is Ārya Bukhaṃ, 7
Golden in colour, holding a lotus and granting protection.
In my navel is Lokeśvara, 8
Green in colour, holding a lotus and granting protection.
All are delightfully seated in crossed-leg posture.
In my mind’s eye, deerskins cover their chests
And graceful adornments of jewels and silks
And the sacred golden thread. 9
The main deity and his entourage
Reside within a dome of light.
From the Poṭala itself, I summon the jñānasattvas,
Dissolve them, presenting offerings and praise,
And in my mind’s eye I see the lord of the family, the buddha red and supreme, 10
As the nirmāṇakāya adorning their crowns.
Life-force of the heart centre, hrīḥ is surrounded
By the turning, self-spinning dhāraṇī mantra.
Light rays stream outwards, burning up sickness, Burning to ash all harmful influences, Clearing all negativity and obstruction.
And light rays stream upwards, purifying buddha-fields, And sending forth streams of imagined offerings.
The light purifies all negativity and delusion
For wandering beings without exception,
And I rest in meditation, all appearances as the Noble One. 11

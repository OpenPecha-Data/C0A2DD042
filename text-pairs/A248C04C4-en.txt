The Single-Page Practice of the Guru of Great Bliss
Homage to self-aware great bliss!
I visualize myself as the Mighty One 1 with consort.
The heart within my chest points upwards,
As an eight-petalled lotus, slightly open.
Inside, upon a moon disc, the essence of relative bodhicitta,
Rests my self-awareness, the Guru of Great Bliss:
With a radiant white complexion, he is youthful, corpulent, and impressive.
He wears the secret gown, a wide-sleeved robe, a red Dharma robe,
A cloak, and a red paṇḍita hat.
He sits in blissful posture, and upon his two hands in equipoise,
Is a bliss-sustaining skull-cup, within which the reddish-white syllable baṃ glows.
Nectar oozes from the syllable,
Filling the skull-cup and causing it to overflow and enter my heart.
oṃ guru-mahā-sukha siddhi hūṃ
O Guru Rinpoche, my teacher!
While you now reside in the Lotus Light pure land,
Your Tibetan subjects and other beings are wracked with suffering—
Is your compassion as indifferent as the sun?
As we remember you with deep sadness and longing,
If you do not listen to our prayers of wholehearted devotion,
If you fail to guide sentient beings including those of us with faith—
What is the use of being primordially awakened?
Our bodies tremble as we shed tears of distress,
With our speech we pray, calling out with a piercing cry.
While with focused minds, we recall your liberating life story.
Like a miracle, quick as lightning, Guru, come to this place!
Encircling you like billowing rainclouds
Are the awakened Three Jewels and Three Roots.
Our father, Padmasambhava, look upon us with compassion!
Bestow blessings and siddhis on us, your children!

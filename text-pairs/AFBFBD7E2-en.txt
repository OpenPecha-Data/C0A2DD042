The Gathering of Auspiciousness A Prayer for the Long Life of Dorje Chang Dagchen Ngawang Kunga Sonam, of the Glorious Sakyapa Puntsok Podrang
Oṃ svasti
May the root and lineage gurus who’ve attained immortality, wondrous and perfect,
And the ocean of yidams and maṇḍala deities,
Ḍākinīs of the three places, Pañjaranātha and Four-Faced Mahākāla,
Dharma guardians, wealth-deities and treasure-keepers grant auspiciousness!
Knowledge-treasure deity, who fulfils the wishes of expression,
Sovereign of all those who have attained the ten powers,
Supreme jewel at the crowns of ten million vidyādharas,
Gentle lord, great Sakya guru, may your life remain secure.
You honour Kunga Nyingpo’s precious treasury of instructions
As the very pinnacle of the victory banner of merit,
And spread them in every direction through teaching and through practice,
Dagchen, mighty Vajra Holder, may your life remain secure.
Splendour of all existence and quiescence, possessed of twofold benefit,
Adorned with the excellent lifestyle of the learned and accomplished,
May your lotus feet remain securely upon the lofty vajra throne
Of fearlessness for an ocean of aeons, I pray.
May the brilliant light of the jewel mountain of your three secrets
Dispel the darkness that has enshrouded teachings and beings;
May the flag that heralds universal victory be raised,
And may the vast white parasol of your activity shelter us all.

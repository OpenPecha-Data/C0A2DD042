Great Treasury of Siddhis: A Guru Yoga of Paṇchen Smṛti
My own body appears clearly as Vajrayoginī.
Above my head upon seats of lotus, sun and moon,
Is Paṇchen Smṛti, who embodies all sources of refuge.
Dressed as a monk with a paṇḍita’s hat and gesture of equanimity.
At his heart is the syllable of the unborn vajra.
From his nostrils emerge the five wisdom winds with rays of light,
Vividly present with the warmth of bliss, blessings and majestic splendour.
With fervent, longing devotion I pray to you.
My own body, possessions and virtues of past, present and future
I continually offer to you, the supreme refuge.
Care for me without ever parting until awakening,
And grant me the supreme and ordinary attainments, here and now!

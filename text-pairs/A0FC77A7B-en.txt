Prayer to Tertön Pegyal Lingpa
Emaho!
Dharmakāya—aware emptiness, primordially pure luminosity,
Sambhogakāya—the victor of original freedom beyond grasping,
And nirmāṇakāya—changeless, naturally arising, spontaneous—
To you, the vajra holder endowed with these three kāyas, I pray.
Representative of Padma of Oḍḍiyāna, foremost warrior,
Who won the siddhi of profound treasure in celestial Akaniṣṭha.
Noble guru, Lingpa, whose three secrets are beyond delusion,
To you I pray: grant me the attainments, ordinary and supreme!

A Prayer to Jowo Rinpoche Combined with Aspirations and a Means to Receive the Four Empowerments
Victorious one, sun-like lord of sages,
Light for this world of Patient Endurance,
Emanating to tame the land of Jambudvīpa—
In you I take refuge, from the very depths of my heart.
Your body is the saṅgha, endowed with knowledge and liberation,
Your speech is the Dharma, true cessation and the path,
Your mind the face of dharmakāya, unsurpassed—
To you, who embody an ocean-like infinity of maṇḍalas,
I continually make offerings of sevenfold purity,
Together with my own body and possessions.
Whatever I see of karma’s influence and power,
I maintain my commitment: to place my trust in you.
Now that I behold your perfect face,
And feel intense, overpowering devotion,
As the very essence of the vase empowerment,
Inspire me to purify bodily obscurations
And attain the vajra body here and now!
Your speech transcends ordinary words and language—
As the empowerment of the perfect secret
Infuses my own speech, in this very instant,
Grant me the attainment of vajra speech!
Your mind is profound, peaceful, free from concepts:
May the wisdom empowerment of awakening through great bliss
Merge with my own eight types of consciousness,
Transforming them into vajra-like enlightened mind.
Through the supreme empowerment of great light-rays,
Emerging from the urṇa circle between your brows,
May all that obscures the knowable be cast aside,
And may I reach the stage of Universal Radiance!
Even if they should revile and abuse me,
May I recognize all beings as my very own parents,
And, through the compassion of repaying their past kindness,
May I empty saṃsāra from its very depths!

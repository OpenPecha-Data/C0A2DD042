Aspiration for the Stages of the Path
Through my enduring efforts to amass the two accumulations
Extensively, on a vast, space-like scale,
May I become a lord of the victorious ones,
A guide for all beings mentally blinded by ignorance.
Until then, throughout the course of my lives,
May Mañjughoṣa guide me with his loving care,
And may I delight the buddhas through finding and practising
The supreme path in which every phase of teaching is complete.
May I teach the key points of this path as I have realized them,
With skilful means and inspired by intense affection,
And, having thereby banished the darkness that engulfs beings' minds,
May I long uphold the teachings of the victorious buddhas!
Where the supreme, precious teachings one is yet to find,
Or where they were once known, but have since declined,
There, through Great Compassion, may I stir people's minds,
And cause the treasury of benefit and happiness to shine!
Through the gradual stages of the path to enlightenment,
Forged through the wondrous activity of buddhas and their heirs,
May I bring splendour to the minds of those seeking freedom,
And long may I cultivate the deeds of the victorious ones!
May I create circumstances conducive to this excellent path
And dispel any impediments; may no-one, human or otherwise,
Ever be separated from this utterly pure path,
Which is lauded by the victorious ones.
As I diligently apply myself to the genuine practice
Of the ten Dharma activities 1 of the supreme vehicle,
May I always be assisted by those with mighty force,
And may an ocean of auspiciousness pervade all directions!

Concise Middle Way Aspiration
When Lord Nāgārjuna teaches the excellent path
Of the Middle Way beyond extremes upon Śrī Parvata
Surrounded by an assembly of the fortunate
May I be born as the very first among his retinue.
At that time, with unrivalled discernment that gauges
The limits of the space-like reality of knowable things,
May I refute all false imitations of Dharma,
And reveal without error the Ārya’s true intent.

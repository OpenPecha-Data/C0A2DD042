A Prayer to Guru Rinpoche That Spontaneously Fulfils All Wishes From the Extremely Secret Assembly of Sugatas
Emaho!
The Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain is perfectly arranged
And lies within the supreme and pure field of Chamaradvīpa in the southwest.
The Vidyādhara Master, Padmasambhava, sits at its peak
Surrounded by hosts of deities of the Three Roots, vidyādharas, and dharmapālas.
I pray to you with single-pointed devotion;
Please look upon me with compassion, Mahāguru,
O Vidyādhara – bless me with your kindness.
Bestow the common and extraordinary accomplishments upon your devoted children,
And grant your blessings, so all our wishes are spontaneously fulfilled!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Dharmakāya of great bliss – you lie beyond all elaboration;
Dance of perfect enjoyment (sambhogakāya), you are unceasing compassion;
Nirmāṇakāya Tötrengtsal, free of all worldly ties,
You sit, surrounded by the eight manifestations of the guru,
The twenty-five destined disciples,
And many accomplished ones and vidyādharas of both India and Tibet.
All emanated from your heart, like the rays from the sun.
I pray to you with single-pointed devotion;
Please look upon me with compassion, Mahāguru,
O Vidyādhara – bless me with your kindness.
Bestow the common and extraordinary accomplishments upon your devoted children,
And grant your blessings, so all our wishes are spontaneously fulfilled!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
The ferocious guru, wrathful Kīlāya,
Emerges from the blazing place, the wisdom of emptiness and luminosity,
Together with the five armour-like deities, the ten wrathful ones, the guardians of the entranceways, and so on –
Deities of great wrath, stood with a blazing wisdom inferno,
I pray to you with single-pointed devotion;
Please look upon me with compassion, Mahāguru,
O Vidyādhara – bless me with your kindness.
Bestow the common and extraordinary accomplishments upon your devoted children,
And grant your blessings, so all our wishes are spontaneously fulfilled!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Repel these dreadful times, the dregs of the age, where noxious and violent spirits – both male and female – run amok.
Repel the evil demons, gods, nāgas, and so forth,
Who abide above, below and everywhere in-between, disturbing the elements.
And, I implore you, repel natural calamities, environmental disasters and the like.
Similarly, powerful and mighty one, please protect me
From all the black magic, spells, and harmful thoughts directed toward me.
I pray to you with single-pointed devotion;
Please look upon me with compassion, Mahāguru,
O Vidyādhara – bless me with your kindness.
Bestow the common and extraordinary accomplishments upon your devoted children,
And grant your blessings, so all our wishes are spontaneously fulfilled!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
At Māratika, you accomplished longevity,
And at Yangleshö, you liberated the malevolent spirits with your practice of Kīlāya –
Vidyādhara Tötrengtsal, you bestow the supreme accomplishment!
Guru of Uḍḍiyāna, deity of longevity, male and female in union,
And, sovereign of wrath, Vajrakumāra,
I supplicate you: bestow the achievement of longevity,
Protect me from all violent obstacles,
And bestow the accomplishment of the most wondrous elixir of life.
As I pray to you, cast your compassionate glance my way!
And bless me, most compassionate vidyādhara,
Bestow the common and extraordinary accomplishments upon your devoted children
And grant your blessings, so all our wishes are spontaneously fulfilled!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Padmasambhava, embodiment of the Three Jewels and the Three Roots,
Wish-fulfilling jewel surrounded by an entourage of heroes and heroines,
Along with the oceanic hosts of dharma guardians and protectors.
I supplicate you with respectful body, speech and mind.
I pray to you with single-pointed devotion;
Please look upon me with compassion, Mahāguru,
O Vidyādhara – bless me with your kindness.
Bestow the common and extraordinary accomplishments upon your devoted children,
And grant your blessings, so all our wishes are spontaneously fulfilled!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
I pray to the body of the Mahāguru:
Bless my body to be blissful and warm.
I pray to the speech of the Mahāguru:
Bless the potency of my speech to ripen fully.
I pray to the mind of the Mahāguru:
Bless my mind that realization may arise from within.
Bestow the accomplishments of your awakened body, speech and mind,
And grant the accomplishment of longevity, immortality itself.
Bestow the glorious accomplishment, the fulfilment of my wishes;
And protect the decadent beings of these terrible times; I pray!
Let this age of weaponry, disturbance and turmoil, be quelled;
And these times of famine and poverty, pacified!
Destroy the capabilities of evil demons and spirits,
And increase and spread the wholesome Dharma.
Pulverise the samaya-breakers of the noxious eight classes,
And spontaneously fulfil my wishes for the Dharma to endure.
In particular, prolong the life of the glorious guru,
And cause the saṅgha to increase swiftly;
May rains be timely and crops and livestock ever plentiful.
Foremost master, you know me! Keep me under your watchful eye!
May there be the unmistakable mutual dependence for us all to experience the comforts and enjoyments of a golden age!
Bless me, so all my wishes may be spontaneously fulfilled!

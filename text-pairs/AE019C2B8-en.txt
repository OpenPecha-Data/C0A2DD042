Dedication of Merit from the Profound Aural Transmission of the Sky-Dharma Mind Treasure's Vajravārāhī Cycle
guru-deva-ḍākinī hūṃ
Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout space and time, turn your attention towards us!
I rejoice at the perfection of the two accumulations.
All the merit I ever accumulate in the three times
I offer to the Three Jewels;
May the teachings of the Victorious One spread far and wide!
I dedicate all merit to all sentient beings;
May all wandering beings attain buddhahood!
May all roots of virtue gather together
And ripen my stream of being!
May I purify the two obscurations to perfect the two accumulations
And have a long life, free of illness; may practice experiences and realization grow!
May I reach the tenth bhūmi in this very life!
When I exit from this life,
May I instantly be born in Sukhāvatī,
And when my lotus opens after birth,
May I reach buddhahood in that very body!
Having reached awakening, may I always be present,
Manifesting to guide wandering beings!
Samaya. Seal. Seal. Seal.

The Sun that Causes the Lotus of Intelligence to Bloom In Praise of the Lineage of Gurus for the Noble Abhidharma
Homage to the guru and supreme deity.
Although you do not move from the dharmakāya,
You display nirmāṇakāya forms in manifold realms,
And through emitting the light rays of activity in all directions,
Accomplish the welfare of beings—to the Lord of Sages, I bow.
An authentic light to dispel the darkness of ignorance
Was the Abhidharma teaching given by the victorious one,
Excellently illuminated by Asaṅga, Vasubandhu and the rest—
To these suns of Abhidharma discourse, I bow.
The holders of the wisdom of Mañjuśrīghoṣa—
Jinaputra 1 and Ācārya Pūrṇavardhana 2
And the one with the wisdom to create the Torch of Crucial Points, 3
To these exponents of Abhidharma, I bow.
Those who spread the Abhidharma in this land of snowy peaks,
Chökyi Tsöndrü, 4 Yeshe Jungne, 5
Drangti Darma Nyingpo and the rest—
To these learned lions of speech, I bow.
The three poisons are afflictions that create saṃsāra,
And ignorance, their root, is to be entirely eliminated.
With mastery of the wisdom training in our minds,
May we conquer the enemy of the afflictions.
Through the virtue of devotedly praising these exponents of Abhidharma,
May the darkness of ignorance be dispelled,
As the light of intelligence extends far and wide,
And may we attain the level of omniscience!

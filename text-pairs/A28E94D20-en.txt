Prayer to the Kagyü Masters
Namo guru!
Great Vajradhara, Tilopa and Nāropa,
Marpa, Mila, Dakpo and all the other gurus
Of the Four Kagyü lineages—Tatsa, 1 Drikung, Taktsang and Lingré, 2
Inspire us with your blessings here and now, I pray.
The successors of Düsum Khyenpa in particular,
That nirmāṇakāya who is entirely without equal,
To all these garland-like incarnations, I pray:
Inspire us with your blessings here and now.
From the palace that is the display of blissful power and wrath,
Great fulfiller of the activity of the buddhas of the three times,
Magnificent adept Chökyi Lama, to you I pray: 3
Inspire us with your blessings here and now.
In enlightened form, you are the great Padma Heruka,
Your speech resonating with the great mantra sound of audible emptiness,
And your wisdom mind the great clear light of all-pervading dharmadhātu—
Guru Karmapa, to you I pray:
Inspire us with your blessings here and now.
Your splendour overwhelms the whole animate and inanimate world, appearance and existence,
Your wisdom form resplendent in its dance of emanation and absorption,
Your realization unchanging, and as pure and vast as space—
Great lord of yogins, to you I pray:
Inspire us with your blessings here and now.
Enemy of all the damsi and gyalgong spirits of this degenerate age,
Guru who embodies all the deities of the maṇḍala
Of the glorious and wrathful, Karmapa—
Great Pakshi, at your feet I pray:
Inspire us with your blessings here and now.
Inspire us to pacify sickness, obstructing forces and harm.
Inspire us to practise Dharma for the full duration of our lives.
Inspire us to stabilize the absorptions of generation and perfection.
Inspire us to realize the dharmakāya nature of our own minds.
Inspire us to emulate you, the guru.

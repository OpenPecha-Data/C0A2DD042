A Sādhana of Mārīcī
Out of the state of emptiness, upon a lotus and moon,
From a syllable Māṃ appears Aśokakāntā-Mārīcī, Sorrowless Resplendence:
Golden in colour, her right hand in the gesture of supreme generosity,
And her left hand holding an aśoka plant.
She is garbed in all the silken and jewelled adornments,
And her two legs are loosely crossed as she sits on lotus and moon.
At her heart upon a moon-disc is a syllable Māṃ surrounded by the mantra,
From which light radiates out, accomplishing all forms of activity including pacifying and protecting.
Oṃ mārīcyai svāhā
The powers of invulnerability, pacification, protection,
And victory over opponents are hereby accomplished!

A Concise Lineage Prayer
Pristine dharmakāya, Padma Amitāyus,
Perfect saṃbhogakāya, All-Holding Padma,
Manifest nirmāṇakāya, Lake-Born Vajra,
Please bless my mind, I pray!
Emanation of Sarasvatī, Yeshé Tsogyal,
Revealer of the five expanses, Zilnön Gyepa Tsal,
Universal lord, Jampal Dewé Nyima,
Please bless my mind, I pray!
Endowed with blessings and transmissions, Gyurmé Ngedön Wangpo,
Lord of all hundred buddha families, Dudjom Drodul Lingpa,
Root Guru, threefold in his kindness,
Please bless my mind, I pray!
Through the blessings of invoking you in this way,
Having received the ripening empowerments and with pure samaya,
May I perfect approach and accomplishment on the path of generation and completion
And attain the enlightened form of Samantabhadra Padmākara!

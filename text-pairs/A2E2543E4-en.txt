Prayer to Khandro Tsering Chödrön
Oṃ svasti!
In the dharmakāya realm of Samantabhadra, you are the Great Mother,
In the saṃbhogakāya fields of the five families, you are Vajravārāhī,
The nirmāṇakāya Shelkar Dorje Tso, consort of the Lotus-born—
Khyentse’s ḍākinī, Tsering Chödrön, Long-life Lamp of Dharma.
And Vajradhara in person, Lord Chökyi Lodrö,
Glorious and noble lama, together with your consort—
May all your enlightened wishes, without exception, be fulfilled,
And grant your blessings, so that we may never be apart!

A Brief Prayer to Sera Khandro
Principal of all three-kāya ḍākinīs, Vajravārāhī,
Manifesting in magical wisdom form as the yoginī:
Kunzang Chönyi Wangmo, to you I pray!
Holding us inseparably in this life, future lives and in the bardo,
May we perfect realization of luminosity, the fundamental nature,
And thereby awaken as Samantabhadra within primordial purity!

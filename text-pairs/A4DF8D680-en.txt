Prayer for Swift Rebirth of the Fourth Dodrupchen Rinpoche, Tupten Trinlé Palzangpo
Kyemaho!
Single, perfect embodiment of the three kāyas, victorious protector of beings,
Sun of the teachings of the Ancient Translations, lord Dodrupchen ,
Tupten Trinlé Palzangpo —'Glorious and Excellent Activity for the Sage’s sun-like Teachings'
Do not relax your compassion, but consider us from the absolute sphere.
You who are like the sun of the teachings in this final, degenerate age,
You who are a captain at the teachings’ helm—why have you departed?
Now, ignorant of causality and of proper conduct, what to do and to avoid,
To whom can we, the protectorless beings of this degenerate age, now turn?
Through the unfailing power of truth and the blessings
Of the Three Roots and hosts of guardian deities,
May the emanation of the incomparable Tupten Trinlé Palzangpo
Swiftly return as a friend and protector to all beings.
May he swiftly return as a sun of the Heart-Essence teachings,
A mighty sovereign of the Dharma Wheel of sūtra and mantra.
May he swiftly return as a great wielder of the magic
Of the perfect strength of the path of two-phase yoga.
Throughout all my lives may I never be separated
From the nature of this glorious guru’s three vajras.
May we all traverse the stages of the four vidyādhara levels
And attain the supreme kāya of union within a single lifetime!

Guru Yoga
Emaho!
My entire perception of the world and beings is purified and transforms into the pure realm of the Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain.
I am the yoginī, blue in colour, and holding knife and skull-cup.
Above my head, upon lotus, sun and moon disk seats placed one above the other
Is the actual embodiment of all sources of refuge, my gracious guru.
He has a reddish glow and blazes with majesty and splendour.
His two eyes are perfectly shaped, his right hand holds a vajra,
And his left is in the gesture of equanimity, holding a skull-cup, a vase and a khaṭvāṅga
In the crook of his arm; he is handsome and wears all the garments related to the three types of vows.
He appears in the form of the Lake-Born Vajra 1
And is surrounded by countless paṇḍitas, siddhas and vidyādharas.
They appear vividly, like a vast outpouring of sesame seeds.
To the gracious guru in whom the blessings of the three secrets
Of all the buddhas and their heirs are gathered together,
I pray, ardently and from the depths of my heart—
Bless my mind! Grant me the attainments!
Finally, from the guru’s three centres
Rays of white, red and blue light shine out in sequence.
They dissolve into my own three centres,
Purifying obscurations and granting empowerments and attainments.
At the end, the guru melts into light
And dissolves into me; my mind and his wisdom merge as one.
Within the state of primordial simplicity, free of concepts,
All phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are spontaneously perfect— aḥ!

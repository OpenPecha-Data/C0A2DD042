The Drumbeat of Deathlessness Prayer for the Long Life of the Glorious Sakyapa Jamyang Ngawang Tutob Wangchuk
Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ
Gentle lord and guru, whose sun-like compassion
Emits infinite light-rays of knowledge and love,
Sovereign-protector of all the realms of time and space,
Omnipresent Mañjuvajra, may your life remain secure.
With your command of speech and all the infinite ways of Dharma,
You are a master of oratory, delighting the daughter of Brahmā 1
And illuminating the exposition and practice of the Sage’s teachings,
Dharma king of the Khön family, may your life remain secure.
Through upholding the powerful activity of the Awesome One,
Who tames the māras and damsi spirits of this degenerate age,
You grant the light of happiness and excellence to the teachings and beings—
May you be sustained within the essence of Vajrakumāra himself.
Great, mighty lord of oceanic auspiciousness and fame,
Revered by the most eminent throughout the three worlds,
Supreme banner of the universal victory of the teachings,
May your life remain secure throughout an ocean of aeons.
As the result of praying and aspiring in this way,
May the twofold aim be spontaneously and effortlessly fulfilled,
May both spiritual and temporal magnificence be enhanced,
And may the light of auspiciousness flood the threefold world.

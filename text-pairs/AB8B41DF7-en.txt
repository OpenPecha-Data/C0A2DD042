The Great Treasure of Blessings In Praise of Mañjuśrī
Oṃ. Supreme wisdom body , youthful Mañjuśrī, to you I prostrate.
Powerful lord of gentle and melodious speech , to you I prostrate.
Wisdom being, with a mind of perfect knowledge, to you I prostrate.
Auspicious coincidence of all the buddhas' wisdom, to you I prostrate.
Wielder of the sword of wisdom, to you I prostrate.
Holder of the lotus of skilful means, to you I prostrate.
Shooter of the piercing arrow of knowledge, to you I prostrate.
Drawer of the great bow of compassion, to you I prostrate.
By remembering you, my lord and protector Mañjughoṣa,
And praying with devotion from the depths of my heart,
Guide me and care for me in your great wisdom,
And cause the eight great treasures of my courageous eloquence to be released, I pray. 1

Lamp Aspiration Prayer (from the Tsok Offering 'A Rain of Blessings')
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
In this joyous and sacred maṇḍala of great bliss,
We are all connected through noble aspirations from the past,
As vajra brothers and sisters, all gathered for the feast,
With gifts, perfectly arranged as offering clouds,
Multiplied and made vast through positive intent and imagination,
To gather perfectly vast stores of merit and wisdom.
Through the power of this aspiration, when, in the future,
We see the delusory appearances of the bardo, beyond imagining,
May mother and child luminosities of space and awareness unite,
And on the path of light with its terrifying sights and sounds,
May the Buddha Amitābha, “Boundless Light”, lead the way,
As a vast retinue of bodhisattvas support us from behind.
Then, saved from saṃsāra's terrible abyss,
May we be reborn in the heart of a lotus flower,
In the blissful land of Lotus Array, there to meet the buddhas,
Receive the sacred Dharma, and complete the paths and stages.
Once perfectly awakened, may we become great guides,
Capable of leading all beings, as infinite as space,
Swiftly, from one blissful state to another.
May this lamp of discerning and primordial wisdom
Banish entirely the darkness of karmic and emotional veils,
Greatly enhance the light of the pure, authentic path,
And illuminate the way to the kingdom of everlasting bliss.

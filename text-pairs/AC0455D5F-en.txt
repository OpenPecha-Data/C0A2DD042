Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
Amidst a billionfold constellations of holders of the teachings,
You are incomparable, like a radiant sun of wisdom and love,
A guardian for those in the Land of Snows and all who dwell
On this southern continent of Jambudvīpa—may your life be secure, I pray!

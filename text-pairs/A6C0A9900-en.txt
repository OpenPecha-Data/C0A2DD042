The Profound Cure (Zabchema) 1 A Practice of Bhaiṣajya-Guru, Lord of Physicians
From my heart, shoot forth dark blue rays of light,
Which flood towards the east, to the buddhafield of Lapis Lazuli,
Where they touch the heart of Bhagavat Bhaiṣajya-Guru, blessed Lord of Physicians,
Who is thus reminded of his former pledges, his prayers and aspirations.
In turn, he sends back further rays of lapis lazuli coloured light,
Which dissolve into my own body and all those who need protection.
Thus, I imagine all diseases evaporating, Dwindling to nothing like frost in sunlight.
Homage to the Buddha Bhaiṣajya-Guru, Lord of Physicians, Radiant Lapis Lazuli King! 2
Lord of Physicians, Radiant Lapis Lazuli King – By the truth of your pledge, your twelve great aspirations,
And by the truth of each of your words, without exception, May each and every illness that affects sentient beings Be pacified now, in this very instant!

The Adamantine Magical Wheel Invoking the Profound Pledge of Padmākara, the Glorious Victor, to Avert the Final War
Emaho!
From the ever-pure and uncreated vajra palace,
Padmasambhava, spontaneous kāya of great bliss,
Universal heruka embodying the oceanic hordes of deities of the three roots and dharma guardians,
Protector of the teachings and beings of the Land of Snows, pray come now!
At this time, the eve of the final battle, when hordes of demons and samaya-breakers gather their legions,
Padmasambhava, supreme lord of all vidyādharas and ḍākinīs,
Pray don’t shrink from your promise now the time has come;
Reveal your awesome, nine-fold, demon-subduing dance now!
Now, when savages gather, the time to help the teachings has come.
Heroic Padmasambhava, embodiment of supreme bliss,
The time for direct wrathful intervention is upon us;
Come to our aid now in your adamantine form of extreme wrath!
We Tibetans, born at the time of the final battle, are scared;
Padmasambhava, supreme master of fearless crazy wisdom,
The time to wipe out the enemies has come:
Fiercely unsheathe your sword, raise it high—use your weapon now!
Glorious and terrifying heruka, Padmasambhava,
The time has come to suppress
With the full force of the three worlds;
Pray intensify the power of your adamantine great bliss!
Out of the dharmadhātu comes forth the great wisdom of equality and great purity;
It unleashes the sounds of ' ala ' and ' hala ' in a roar of laughter,
And displays its extremely wrathful kāyas—
Devour the heart blood of the demons, māras, rākṣasas, and samaya violators!
Without ever leaving the wisdom-mind dharmakāya's great peace and equanimity,
You arise as real blood-drinking rūpakāyas;
Pray quell the fighting of this, the final battle,
And restore peace to the land of Tibet!

Prayer to Root and Lineage Masters, and the Assembly of Deity, Ḍākinīs and Dharma Protectors of the Sakya Lineage
Root and lineage masters of the Sakya tradition of Mañjuśrī Protectors,
Glorious Hevajra, who is the most essential yidam deity,
And the assembly of ḍākinīs, dharma protectors and deities of wealth,
In devotion I pray to you: look upon me with eyes of wisdom!
May I and all those sentient beings who have connections with me
Live long, be free of illness, and increase our realization and experiences in this life;
And when we take rebirth in the pureland of Great Bliss in the next,
Bless us so that we can guide all beings of the three realms.

Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
Oṃ Svasti! Through the power and blessings of an infinite ocean of long-life deities,
May the life of this emanation of Khyentse Yeshe Dorje,
The one named ‘Sun of the Buddha’s Teachings’, Thubten Nyima,
Remain secure, and may all his aspirations for the benefit of the teachings and beings be fulfilled.

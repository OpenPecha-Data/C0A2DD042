Daily Practice of Vajrakīla
Āḥ! This present awareness, free from conceptual mind,
Profound and luminous, like the sky,
Is the true nature of the yidam deity.
There are no attributes, like face or arms, to cling to.
The great tiklé is the vajra body—
The youthful Vajrakumāra, who does not age or weaken,
But remains forever stable, the display of his retinue perfect and spontaneously present:
All that appears is the form of the deity;
All sounds are the kīla of great bliss;
All thoughts are the mind of vajra wrath.
All appearances, sounds and awareness form the
Kāyas and realms of the maṇḍala of the deity.
oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya sarva vighnān baṃ hūṃ phaṭ | jaḥ hūṃ āḥ
May I be born again and again, in the family of the herukas,
With the incomparable Vajrakumāra as my guide,
My mind endowed with compassion,
And with deep devotion toward the master!
May I be born again and again, to hold the vajra and the kīla,
To study the profound Dharma,
And, without any kind of discrimination,
To partake of the elixir of the queen!
Through the merit of this, may I and all sentient beings,
Gain victory over the māras, overcome all obstacles
And certainly attain the fruition of enlightenment—
The supreme nirvāṇa of Vajrakumāra!

The Swift Infusion of Blessings A Prayer to the Lineage of the Single Mind Kīla Heart-Practice, Part of the 'Neck-Pouch Dagger’ (Purba Gulkhukma) Cycle
All-pervasive lord Samantabhadra, Vajradharma,
The Lake-Born Vajra, the king, subject and companion, 1
And the nine karmic sons, especially Nanam 2 —
To you I pray: dispel all obstacles, outer and inner!
Gökyi Demtruchen, 3 Lekden Dorje, 4
Ngakgi Wangpo, 5 Pema Trinlé Tsal, 6
Lerab Lingpa 7 and Pema Wangchen 8 —
To you I pray: dispel all obstacles, outer and inner!
King of the wrathful, fearsome Vajrakumāra,
Ten wrathful ones, together with your consorts, devourers, executioners, and four doorkeepers,
Sixteen kīlaya guardians and twenty-eight iśvarīs—
To you I pray: dispel all obstacles, outer and inner!
May the outer maṇḍala arise in the symbolic material kīla,
The inner maṇḍala be awakened as the deities of channels and elements,
The strength of bodhicitta be perfected as the secret maṇḍala,
And may we actualize the innermost secret awareness sphere!

The Beat of the Vajra Drum
How fortunate I am to have such a sublime protector as you,
Padmasambhava of Oḍḍiyāna,
Embodiment of all the Buddhas throughout the three times.
Always care for me in your compassion as a mother would her only child!
Remove all outer, inner and secret obstacles,
Spontaneously fulfil my each and every wish,
Bless me to perfect my thoughts and deeds to aid the teachings and beings,
And grant me the capacity to fulfil your enlightened vision!
Self-awareness is itself the Guru of Great Bliss,
Who sits ever-present upon the eight-petalled lotus at the centre of my heart –
The primordial Vajra Wisdom, the essence of my being,
Permanent, stable and unfluctuating – how wonderful!

The Noble Sūtra The Ringing Staf
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Once, the Blessed One said to the monks
“You shall carry this ringing staff
Why
Because past buddhas have carried this ringing staff an
future buddhas will carry this ringing staff
Present buddhas also carry this ringing staff
having now attained awakening, I carry the ringing staff
In a similar manner, past, future, and present buddhas instruct the listeners, ‘You shall carry the ringing staff.
So now, having attained awakening, I also teach you in accordance with the Dharma of the buddhas, an
you too shall carry the ringing staff
Why
“The ringing staff is also called the staff of gnosis 
It is also called the staff of excellent qualities 
Because it signifies the gnosis of noble beings, it is called the staff of gnosis
Because it builds the foundation of excellent qualities, it is called the staff of excellent qualities
“This ringing staff signifies that the holder is a sublime being belonging to the lineage of noble beings, it is an emblem that points to the Dharma of the path, and it is a practice that facilitates recollection
Therefore, you should carry it according to the Dharma.
Then Venerable Mahākāśyapa rose from his seat
adjusted his robes, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, joined his palms, and knelt on the ground
He inquired of the Blessed One
“Blessed One, why is it called a ‘ringing staff’
How should it be carried
May the Blessed One explain
We will practice as instructed.
The Blessed One said to Kāśyapa, “Listen well, keep it in mind, and I shall explain

“The ringing staff causes understanding
What does the ringing staff cause one to comprehend
One will understand suffering, emptiness, and the fetters that are afflictions of the three realms, and one will clearly realize the four truths and the twelve links of dependent origination
Therefore, it is said to cause understanding
“The ringing staff eliminates pride

“The ringing staff keeps others at a distance

those who hold the ringing staff will not fall back but become excellent. Therefore, it is said that it brings accomplishment.
“Kāśyapa,” the Blessed One concluded, “since the meanings of the term ringing staff are vast and multifarious, they cannot be described fully, but for the time being you should comprehend them in that way.
Kāśyapa then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, if the meanings of the ringing staff are so
what are the reasons for this whole range of meanings, from ‘ staff of gnosis’ to ‘it is a practice aimed at the application of recollection’
Could the Blessed One explain?
The Blessed One replied, “The ringing staff causes the accomplishment of the practice of gnosis
causes the accomplishment of vast learning
engenders an unhindered understanding of worldly and transcendent wisdom, virtue and nonvirtue, the conditioned and unconditioned, and the contaminated and uncontaminated
and it causes the accomplishment of wisdom
Therefore, it is called the staff of gnosis
“Practicing the strict observance of discipline, patience, the cultivation of meditative concentration with a single-pointed mind devoid of distraction
and constant meritorious actions, as if their head or turban had caught fire, those who hold the ringing staff do not forsake these practices even for an instant
Therefore, it is called the staff of excellent qualities
“Those who hold this ringing staff will become perfect in the sixteen kinds of practice
(–) the four truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the path
(–) the four immeasurable states of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity
(–) the four meditative concentrations: the first meditative concentration, second meditative concentration, third meditative concentration, and fourth meditative concentration
and (–) the four formless states of meditative attainment: the sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, and the sphere of neither perception nor absence of perception
In addition, they will become perfect in the thirty-seven practices—namely
the thirty-seven aids to awakening—and they will discern these dharmas with clarity
Because they actualize them physically, they do not pursue words
They frolic in these dharmas and are free to enter the gateways to liberation of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness at will and without difficulty
Such persons are called noble beings
“Possessing such qualities internally, they hold the ringing staff externally
Because of this, it is beyond doubt that such persons are perfect in the excellent qualities of noble beings: discipline, patience, meditative concentration, wisdom, the threefold knowledge, the six types of supernatural knowledge, and the eight kinds of liberation 
Because the ringing staff engenders respect by signifying that such persons are noble beings, it is called the sign of a noble being
“As for the expression ‘that which signifies that the holder is a sublime being,’ because of possessing the nature of gnosis within, a person is said to be ‘sublime.
The ringing staff engenders respect by signifying that the person is a noble being
It thereby shows that, because of possessing the nature of gnosis that is present within a noble being, the holder accomplishes the foundation of excellent qualities, strives for increasingly higher qualities, and accomplishes them well
Therefore, it is called that which signifies that the holder is a sublime being
“It makes known that ‘this clear-minded person, having practiced by means of wisdom
will enter before long the path leading to a peaceful and secluded state beyond conditioning, namely the bliss of nirvāṇa, the ultimate place.
Therefore, the ringing staff is called the emblem that points to the Dharma of the path
“As for the expression ‘it is a practice that facilitates recollection,
this ringing staff has three levels
Just by seeing the structure of the three segments, having recollected the suffering of the three lower states of existence
one will cultivate discipline, meditative stabilization, and wisdom
having recollected the three misfortunes—aging, sickness, and death
one will dispel the three poisons: attachment, hatred, and ignorance; an
having recollected the three realms as impermanent
one will generate belief in and respect for the Three Jewels
eliminate the three realms of existence 
discard the three contaminations
purify the three kinds of karma
wish to possess the threefold knowledge
enter the three liberations
obtain the three states of the six recollections, an
realize the three gnoses that take one far
Hence, it is presented in its structure of three segments
“Furthermore, it is made with four prongs
For the purpose of severing the four types of birth 
recollecting the four truths 
cultivating the four immeasurable states
entering the four meditative concentrations
purifying the four states of meditative attainment
revealing the four applications of mindfulness
teaching the four kinds of exertion, an
obtaining the four bases of supernatural power, it is made with four prongs
“With the central wooden shaft included, it is shown to have five aspects. For the purpose of forsaking the five views
discarding the disturbances of the suffering of saṃsāra of the five states of existence
cultivating the five faculties 
possessing the five powers 
eliminating the five hindrances
dismantling the five aggregates, an
attaining the Dharma body having five parts, it is shown to have five aspects
“It is taught that there are twelve rings so that one will recall the twelve links of dependent origination and will do so without being impeded
one will cultivate the meditative concentrations of the twelve doors, an
one will recollect with a flawless mind
“It is taught to have seven parts—the combination of the three levels and the four prongs
so that one will recollect the Dharma of the seven branches of the awakening of the Tathāgata and accomplish the seven treasures of noble beings
“With the lower tip included, it is shown to have eight parts. It is for the purpose of teaching the eight branches of the path
attaining the eight kinds of liberation , an
dispelling the eight inopportune states that the eight parts are shown
“That is the brief meaning of the ringing staff
Therefore, you should retain it well.
Kāśyapa promised the Blessed One
“Blessed One, it shall be done just as it has been taught in the noble statements.
Mahākāśyapa then inquired again of the Blessed One
“Blessed One, are all the teachings of the tathāgatas of the three times the same?
The Blessed One replied, “For some, the staff is the same but the usage is different
On account of that, during the time of some, it is made with four prongs, an
during the time of others, it is made with two prongs
The number of rings does not vary
As for me, I have taught that it should be made with four prongs and twelve rings
“The two-prong design was established by the Tathāgata Kāśyapa
This meaning was established for the sake of sentient beings recollecting the two truths : conventional truth and ultimate truth .
At that time, after the Blessed One had spoken these words
Venerable Mahākāśyapa, the entourage of , followers, and the large congregation were delighted and gave praise respectfully
This concludes The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on the Ringing Staff

A Brief Method for Reciting Samantabhadra's Prayer of Good Actions
In the Buddha, the Dharma and the Supreme Assembly
I take refuge until I attain enlightenment.
Through the merit of practising generosity and so on,
May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of all beings.
In the sky before me is the guru, the conqueror Śākyamuni,
And in front of him is the bodhisattva Samantabhadra,
In the cardinal and intermediate directions, above and below, are the budddhas and bodhisattvas, and the rest,
Who remain as witnesses to the fulfilment of these aspirations,
And declare facilitating words of truth, through which the objects of my aspiration
May be accomplished just as I wish for and request,
And so that having entirely perfected supreme enlightened action,
I may bring the aspirations of Samantabhadra to complete fulfilment.
Śākyamuni and his retinue melt into light and dissolve into me.
I rest in a state of clear light, free from conceptual elaboration.

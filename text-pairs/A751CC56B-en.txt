The Vidyādharas' Words of Truth An Aspiration Connected with the Stages of the Path of the Three Roots, from the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse
Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, Garab Dorje,
Padmākara—embodiment of infinite buddhas,
King, subject and companion, 1 Omniscient Father and Son, 2
And vidyādharas of the three lineages of transmission—pray grant me your attention!
Lordly gurus, who confer wisdom’s direct transmission
And whose three secrets are the billowing arrays of the Illusory Net,
Infinite peaceful and wrathful deities of the Collected Teachings of the Awesome Ones,
And Kharchen, mistress of ḍākinīs, pray grant me your attention!
May the three vajras of my original state, spontaneously present from the very beginning,
Be matured by the four empowerments of the vase that confers majesty;
May I thereby gain the ability to enter the four maṇḍalas
And accomplish the supreme fortune of the vajra family.
May I perfect the path of the preliminaries by renouncing existence,
Establish the foundation of the Great Vehicle through altruism,
Cleanse my mind by means of accumulation and purification
And, with consummate devotion in particular, cause my mind and the guru’s wisdom to merge as one.
Through the five samādhis and four hidden instructions,
The generation phase that perceives the world and inhabitants as the guru
And the profound perfection phase whereby mind and wisdom merge as one,
May I master the five experiences of movement, attainment, familiarity, stability and perfection.
Through the perfection stage of the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel of the Oral Lineage
And the swift path of the messenger-consort known as Buddhahood Without Meditation ,
May I easily attain the four stages of the vidyādharas
And perfect the qualities of the ten stages and five paths.
In particular, by the power of purifying body, speech and mind
Through the Supreme Vehicle’s Atiyoga practices of separating 3 saṃsāra and nirvāṇa on both outer and inner levels
May I distinguish 4 mind from awareness, abide in the view by means of the four ways of leaving things as they are , 5
Enhance my experience by meditating on the six lamps of luminosity,
Perfect the practice of the four visions of luminosity
And actualize the stage of the indestructible rainbow body!
If I lack the fortune to be liberated in this life
May I be freed within the expanse of the ground in any of the three intermediate states,
Arrive at a natural nirmāṇakāya pure realm, and, through the force of my enlightened activity,
Be able to deliver all beings to the primordial state!

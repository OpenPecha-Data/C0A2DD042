A Daily Practice of Vajraṇakhī
Namo! In the guru, the Three Jewels, and the yidam deity,
With the deepest devotion I take refuge.
So that all beings, as limitless as the sky, may attain supreme, unsurpassed awakening,
I shall meditate on Vajraṇakhī, ‘Vajra Claw’.
The union of basic space and wisdom is the blazing syllable hūṃ ,
From which, within an immense charnel ground,
I appear as the activity ḍākinī,
Dark blue in colour, with one face and two hands.
Her right hand wields a sword that cuts through thoughts,
And her left rolls a vajra-kīla, an indestructible dagger.
Her two legs, in the dancing posture, trample enemies and obstructors.
Her body is adorned with charnel ground ornaments and
She stands within an expanse of blazing wisdom fire.
In her heart upon a sun disk
Is hūṃ , dark blue and encircled by the mantra garland,
From which light radiates, shooting out sparks of flame,
That burn away all sickness, harmful influences, negativity and obstruction.
From her body emanate further forms that fill the universe completely;
Her speech reverberates with thunderous wrathful mantras;
And her mind is ablaze with liberating wisdom.
All sorcerous gods and spirits,
All demons, obstructors, enemies and samaya corruptors are
Struck with the kīla, pounded with the hammer,
Suppressed beneath the seal and thus completely annihilated!
oṃ gha gha ghātaya ghātaya sarvaduṣṭān vajradharodājñāpayati sarva vighnān kāya vāk cittaṃ vajrakīli kīlaya hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ phaṭ ||
With hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ everything dissolves.
With phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ I rearise as the deity.
With oṃ āḥ hūṃ I am protected.
Through the positivity and merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Vajraṇakhī, and thereby
Every single sentient being
Reach her state of perfection too.

Prayer to the Lineage of Parting from the Four Attachments
Guru and guide to living beings, perfectly awakened Buddha,
Foremost of buddha’s heirs, gentle-voiced protector Mañjughoṣa,
And the one for whom he cared, precious Sakyapa master 1 —
To these three supreme and incomparable sources of refuge, I pray!
Sönam Tsemo, 2 who mastered the five sciences completely,
Jetsün Rinpoche, 3 who fully understood both sūtra and tantra,
And the second lord of sages, Sakya Paṇḍita 4 —
To these three regents of the victorious ones, I pray!
Chögyal Pakpa Rinpoche, 5 who was a sovereign of the teachings,
Könchok Pal, 6 whose mind was rich with study, contemplation and meditation,
And Chöje Drakpukpa, 7 who gained supreme accomplishment—
To these three learned and accomplished saints, I pray!
Sönam Gyaltsen, 8 who was an adornment for the crowns of beings,
Palden Tsultrim, 9 who was a mighty lord of practical instruction,
And Yeshe Gyaltsen, 10 who mastered all there is to know—
To these three supreme guides and gurus, I pray!
As I pray to these, the hosts of glorious gurus,
May they gaze upon me swiftly with eyes of compassion,
And grant their blessings so that I wholeheartedly abandon
Attachment for the appearances of this life, the basis of ruin!
Since there is not even the slightest occasion for happiness,
And suffering is so unbearable and difficult to endure,
Grant your blessings so that I generate intense renunciation
For the continuous torment of saṃsāra’s three realms!
Grant your blessings so that through cultivating bodhicitta,
Based on the equalizing and exchange of myself and others,
Which is the single path taken by the buddhas and their heirs,
I may rid myself of thoughts and attitudes of selfish concern!
Grant your blessings so that through deciding that all phenomena
Are primordially dream-like and illusory, apparent yet unreal,
The path of the middle way of unity beyond clinging to extremes
May arise authentically in my mind!

Prayer for Peace and Stability in Tibet
Unfailing sources of refuge—Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and gurus, yidams and ḍākinīs,
And especially Avalokiteśvara, protector of the Land of Snows,
Together with Noble Tārā and Guru Padmasambhava,
We pray to you: think of us and the sacred pledges you have made!
Grant your blessings, so that our prayers of aspiration may be fulfilled entirely.
Beings of this degenerate age think and act in perverse ways,
And disturbances in the elements, both outer and inner,
Mean that disease and pestilence, unknown in ages past, threaten human beings and animals alike.
Planetary forces, nāgas, gyalpo , obstructing spirits and elemental forces,
Cause blight, frost and hail, poor harvests, war and conflict,
Untimely rains and ominous portents for the Land of Snows,
And there is fear of earthquakes, fire, adversaries, and environmental catastrophe,
And especially of foreign invaders who might harm the teachings.
May all types of harm and violence in these snowy lands,
Be swiftly pacified and eliminated entirely.
May precious sublime bodhicitta
Arise naturally in the minds of all beings, human and non-human alike,
So that they never again think or act in harmful, violent ways.
May the minds of all be filled with love for one another!
May the whole of Tibet enjoy abundant splendours, happiness and wellbeing!
And may the Buddha’s teachings flourish and endure!
Through the force of the truth embodied in the Three Roots, the Buddhas and their heirs,
And through the power of all the sources of merit throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
And of our own completely pure, positive intention,
May this, our prayer of aspiration, be fulfilled!

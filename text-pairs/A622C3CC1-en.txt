A Prayer of Aspiration towards Sukhāvatī
Emaho!
In a realm above and to the West,
Lies Sukhāvatī, forged through bodhicitta and prayer,
In its centre, the blessed Lord Amitābha, 'Boundless Light',
Presides amidst a retinue of countless bodhisattvas.
Devotedly, with body, speech and mind, I pay homage,
I offer real and imagined gifts and confess my harmful acts and downfalls,
I rejoice in virtue, and request you to turn the wheel of Dharma,
I beseech you to remain, and dedicate all virtue towards enlightenment:
May all sentient beings, my very own parents, as infinite as space,
Attain the omniscient state of perfect Buddhahood!
To this end, from this moment on,
I shall train in the actions of a bodhisattva.
With this representing the virtues of past, present and future,
I dedicate it so that all beings may attain perfect enlightenment,
And, in all their lives until then,
Be born in Sukhāvatī, there to behold the Victorious One!

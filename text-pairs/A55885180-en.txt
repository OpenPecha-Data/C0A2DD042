Prayer of the View, Meditation and Conduct
Namo guru!
The primordial ground, the great, ever-pure primordial emptiness,
Which is free from all elaboration and change,
Is the very nature of uncompounded and self-arising awareness:
Bless me so that I may recognize the view, my very own nature.
To meditate without distraction in this uncontrived expanse,
Which has neither contraction nor expansion, is simply to settle,
Without thought or expression, in natural awareness – the three kāyas:
Bless me so that I may meditate like this, with decisiveness and ease.
All thoughts of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are unbound and naturally liberated,
And there is no need for effort-based antidotes
In this, the great, primordial liberation beyond adoption and rejection:
Bless me so that I may realize this great, all-encompassing liberation upon arising.
The supremely secret view, meditation, conduct and result of the Great Perfection
Are to be realized through the guru’s kindness,
And the devotion of one’s own awareness arising as the guru:
Bless me so that your inspiration and blessings may enter my heart.

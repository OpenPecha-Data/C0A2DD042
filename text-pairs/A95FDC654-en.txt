Daily Practice of Yangdak Heruka
Aḥ. From emptiness and great compassion
In union, the expression of awareness arises as the dark blue Hūṃ,
Which instantly transforms
Into the awesome Vajra Heruka
Upon seats of lotus, sun and haughty ones.
He is dark blue in colour like the azure sky,
With three faces, blue, white and red,
And six arms, the right ones holding vajra and trident,
And the left holding bell, skull-cup and a lasso of intestines.
He is adorned with the heruka and charnel-ground accoutrements.
His great consort is Krodheśvarī,
Pale blue and holding a vajra and skull-cup filled with blood.
Their blazing forms possess the nine modes of expression
And are resplendent amidst a mass of blazing wisdom fire.
The eight wrathful females, Gaurī and the rest,
Are to the right and left, perfect in the detail of their faces and arms.
The main deity’s three centres are marked with the three syllables.
The wisdom beings bestow empowerment and create the perfect crown.
I visualize samayasattva and jñānasattva in great indivisibility.
At the main deity’s heart is the space of the glorious knot,
In which a blue Hūṃ emits the eight-syllable Rulu mantra,
Radiant and glowing as brightly as a lamp.
Sights and sounds are actuated as the non-dual wisdom maṇḍala
Of the great and glorious Heruka.
oṃ rulu rulu hūṃ bhyo hūm
The apparent aspect, the circles of deities,
Dissolve into the unborn dharmadhātu.
Then, once again, I arise as the display
Of the awesome Heruka’s three secrets.

The Hook of Compassion Calling the Guru from Afar
Guru, watch over me!
Essence and embodiment of all the buddhas,
Great treasury of the sacred Dharma of scripture and realization,
Sovereign of the noble saṅgha community,
Root guru, watch over me!
Inspire me to integrate the Dharma with my own mindstream!
Sun that dispels the darkness of ignorance,
Jewel providing all that one might wish for or require,
Captain leading to deliverance from saṃsāra’s ocean,
Root guru, watch over me!
Inspire me to integrate the Dharma with my own mindstream!
Embodiment of all sources of refuge and sovereign of the Three Roots,
The mere thought of whom dispels the anguish of existence and quiescence,
Controller of the secret treasury of the seven authoritative transmissions,
Spiritual guide Emanation of Luminosity, 1 watch over me!
Inspire me to integrate the Dharma with my own mindstream!
Embodiment of the wisdom of all the victorious ones without exception,
Essence of the emanated lotsāwa Vairotsana,
Pioneer of the Five Treasuries, protector of the beings of the Land of Snows,
Pema Garwang Lodrö Thayé, 2 watch over me!
Inspire me to integrate the Dharma with my own mindstream!
With the armour of an altruistic resolve to awaken,
You adopt the ways of a bodhisattva heir to the victorious,
Veritable trove of Dharma teachings of sūtra and mantra,
Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, watch over me!
Inspire me to integrate the Dharma with my own mindstream!
In the palace of the four main chakras,
Deities of the four-kāya guru, watch over me!
Grant the supreme vase, secret, and knowledge-wisdom empowerments,
And inspire me to attain the level of the four kāyas!
In short, as from now until I reach the essence of awakening,
I pray constantly and with single-pointed focus
To the precious root guru,
Effortlessly bestow the attainments, ordinary and supreme! 3

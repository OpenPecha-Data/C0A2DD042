Brief Sukhāvatī Aspiration
Padmākara, who embodies all the buddhas’ compassion,
With special care for beings of this age of fivefold strife,
Manifested in the form of one who wears the saffron robes—
Incomparable lord Atiśa, to you I pray!
Protector, may you regard us well with your happy gaze,
And with your loving hands dispel my own and others’ flaws,
The obscurations caused by karma and the afflictions,
And lead us all to Sukhāvatī, pure land of perfect bliss!

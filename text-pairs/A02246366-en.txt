Prayer to Rendawa Shönnu Lodrö
You are the great treasury of non-referential compassion, Avalokiteśvara;
The powerful lord of flawless wisdom, Mañjuśrī;
And the destroyer of all demonic forces, Guhyapati (Vajrapāṇi);
The crowning glory of all the learned masters of this Land of Snows—
Rendawa Shönnu Lodrö, at your feet I pray!

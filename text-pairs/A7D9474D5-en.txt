Dzogchen Aspiration Prayer
May we obtain the great confidence of the View of the perfect equality of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
May we greatly perfect and strengthen Meditation, which is naturally resting in the unaltered state.
May we gain greater skill in the Action, which is natural and spontaneous non-action.
May we naturally discover the Dharmakāya, which is beyond gaining and losing.

Brief Sur Offering
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
This sur offering, billowing clouds of oceanic sensory enjoyments,
I offer to the Three Jewels and Three Roots, the guests invited out of respect.
Protect me in your compassion, I pray, and cause me to complete the accumulations and purify my obscurations!
I offer to the oath-bound dharma protectors, guests invited on account of their qualities:
May you be pleased and satisfied and dispel all outer and inner obstacles!
I offer to the sentient beings of the six classes, guests invited out of compassion:
May you be free from all forms of suffering and gain immaculate bliss!
I dedicate to harmful influences, obstructing forces, gods and spirits, the guests to whom I owe karmic debts:
May all violence and malevolence be pacified and may you live happily and beneficially.
In a state of unimpeded openness, beyond any focus on the various guests in saṃsāra or nirvāṇa,
May we be liberated in the dharmadhātu expanse that is entirely free of the three conceptual spheres.

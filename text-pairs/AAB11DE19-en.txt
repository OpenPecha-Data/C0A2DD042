A Song of Innermost Praise to Vajrasattva
Oṃ vajrasatva aha vajra gīrti ahoye!
Glorious, omnipresent, self-arisen great secret,
Masterfully emanating and reabsorbing oceanic maṇḍalas,
Vajra-like being of indestructible great bliss,
Unchanging Vajrasattva, to you I offer praise!
Oṃ—fivefold syllable, secret treasury of wisdom,
Vast source of mantras throughout the oceanic tantras,
Inexhaustible illusion, the song of the vajra nāda,
Atemporal, not of the three times, to you I offer praise!
Vajra—in the indestructible, vajra-like nature,
Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are contained as one,
Natural kāya of ground tantra, primordially pure clear light,
Original buddha pervading environment and beings—to you I offer praise!
Sattva—great being, who has reached the sublime peace
That is the culmination of the true path and true cessation,
And who sounds the Dharma of transmission and realization
As music throughout every realm—to you I offer praise!
For beings to be trained, as numerous as atoms in the universe,
You cut the web of threefold obscuration with the wheel of path tantra.
Great radiance who banishes the darkness of ignorance
In wisdom's expansive light, to you I offer praise!
From the magical display of unborn emptiness, the true meaning of A,
The fruitional tantra, the maṇḍala of the Illusory Net, is complete.
To you who make the vast, cloud-like array of the four kāyas
Extend unto the very limits of the universe, I offer praise!
Through the virtue of proclaiming this melodious song
Of definitive praise everywhere and in all directions,
May beings attain the three secrets of Vajrasattva,
The one who turns the wheels of threefold tantra!

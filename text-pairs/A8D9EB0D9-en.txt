To all you masters of bodhicitta,
We pray, bless us with your compassion!
In the fertile field of the four boundless qualities,
May the shoots of bodhicitta take root,
Ripening into the excellent fruit of the path of the six pāramitās,
To become the basis of sustenance for beings of the three worlds.
Grant your blessings so that with the wisdom realizing the equality of self and others,
All dualistic clinging to ourselves and objects may be cut right through,
Our own and others’ welfare may be accomplished spontaneously,
And we may perfect the supreme mind of bodhicitta.

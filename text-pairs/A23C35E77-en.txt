Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Bhagavān was dwelling in Sukhāvatī together with the great saṅgha of bodhisattvas
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ārya Avalokiteśvara
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mahā­sthāma­prāpta
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkaṃbhin
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Kṣitigarbha
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra

Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­tīrtha­maṅgala­dhārin

Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara went to the place where the Bhagavān was, paid homage at the Bhagavān’s feet, and remained at one side
Mahādevī also went toward the Bhagavān, paid homage at his feet, and circumambulated him three times
Then she also paid homage to all the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were dwelling in Sukhāvati and remained at one side
The Bhagavān was adorned with many hundreds of thousands of merits and surrounded by as many as ten million tathāgatas
As Indra, Brahmā and the guardians of the world all offered their praises and acclaim
the Bhagavān, having gazed at Śrī Mahādevī, addressed Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara as follows in his Great Brahmā voice
“Avalokiteśvara, if any one of the kings, ministers, bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas or śūdra
retains this praise “The One Hundred and Eight Names of Śrī Mahādevī which are Renowned as Stainless,
then the kṣatriya king’s kingdom, the fears of those beings there, as well as the epidemics and harmful influences will all be pacified, an
no one at all will fear robbers, rogues, humans or nonhumans
Wealth, grains, treasuries and stores will all increase
and the Glorious Mahādevī will no doubt abide in the home of this kṣatriya king.
Then those bodhisattva mahāsattvas said, “Bhagavāṇ, these words are well said. Excellent! Excellent
Those people who will retain the names of Śrī Mahādevī and who will put them into practice once they have heard them will have those aforementioned qualities and benefits.
O Avalokiteśvara, previously, in the pas
in a world system called Ratna­saṃbhavā, the tathāgata called Ratna­kusuma­guṇa­sāgara­vaiḍūrya­kanaka­giri­suvarṇa­kāṃcana­prabhāsa­śrī came forth into the world
Śrī Mahādevī generated roots of virtue in his presence and in the presence of many other tathāgatas, too
Now, the names of the tathāgatas make Śrī Mahādevī’s roots of virtue flourish and come to fulfillment
They stay with her always, these names which here in this world Śrī Mahādevī recites precisely an
which dispel all sins, eliminate all offenses, make all effects stainless, gather and increase wealth and grains, eradicate poverty
attract and catch the attention of all gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
pacifying all epidemics, natural misfortunes, disputes, conflicts, dissensions, and arguments, and which will bring the six perfections to fulfilment
They are as follows

Look at us, save us, and emancipate us from all sufferings
Make us turn in the direction of all collections of merits
these names of Śrī Mahādevī—which eliminate all offenses, overcome all sins
accumulate all merits, eliminate all inauspiciousness, and accumulate all glories, happiness and good fortune
Fearless Avalokiteśvar
who is going to retain and recite these names of the tathāgatas, should rise in the morning, clean up, and
having offered flowers and incense to all the buddhas, also offer sandalwood incense to Śrī Mahādevī
Then, when he recites these names, all glory, all happiness and joys will be obtained
The gods will all guard, protect and preserve him, and all of his purposes will be fulfilled.
When the Bhagavān had thus spoken, the fearless bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, Śrī Mahādevī, the entire retinue, and the world, including gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and  praised the words of the Bhagavān
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ārya Avalokiteśvara asked the Bhagavān
Bhagavān, where did Śrī Mahādevī generate her roots of virtue
Śrī Mahādevī generated roots of virtue in the presence of tathāgatas as numerous as the grains of sand of the River Ganges

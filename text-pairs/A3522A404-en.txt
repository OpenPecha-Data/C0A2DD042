The Fulfilment of All Wishes Prayer and Entrustment of Activity to the Glorious Guru Mahākāla Pañjaranātha
Oṃ. I prostrate before the Guru Mahākāla!
Āḥ. Help me to realize how the victorious ones’ activity is unending,
Hūṃ. And your wisdom mind is the unborn dharmadhātu.
Hrīḥ. We practitioners who maintain the samaya,
In our unwavering faith and devotion for you, O Kāla,
Offer not just empty mouthing but heartfelt prayer:
Pacify anything that obstructs our path,
And fulfil our each and every wish.
At the mere thought of you, let the hosts of demons,
Gyalgong , ghosts, and damsi spirits of this degenerate age
Be crushed as if to dust, O Vajra Mahākāla.
As Pañjaranātha, marshal the forces of power and strength.
At this exceptionally disruptive time in particular,
Let those who would harm the Victorious Ones’ teachings
Or rob their holders and dharma-observing kings, ministers and householders
Of their happiness be obliterated, so that not even their names remain.
For all who uphold the Sage’s precious teachings,
Sublime individuals, no matter where they may be,
Let their lives be long, their visionary wishes fulfilled,
And their activity extend in each of the ten directions.
Ensure that everyone in this world has right view,
Regards one another with parental affection,
Gives up conflict, prospers with the glory of merit,
And lives a long and happy life in perfect health.
As I constantly rely on, offer to, and praise you,
Let the meaning of these prayers be realized,
And carry out your activity of triumphing over
All forms of hostility, human and non-human.
Relatively, you are the Black One who holds the gaṇḍī , 1
Ultimately, the clear and empty essence of my own mind.
May I confidently recognize this, traverse paths and stages,
And attain the thirteenth bhūmi as a victorious Vajra Holder.

A Prayer to Mañjuśrī
Emaho!
In the Akaniṣṭha realm of reality, free from elaboration,
Dharmakāya teacher Samantabhadra,
To you I pray: Inspire me with your blessings,
And grant me the attainment of unimpeded wisdom!
In the great realm of fivefold ceaselessness,
Sambhogakāya teachers of the five families,
To you I pray: Inspire me with your blessings,
And grant me the attainment of unimpeded wisdom!
In the Five-Peaked Mountain to the east,
Nirmāṇakāya Mañjuśrīs of the five families,
To you I pray: Inspire me with your blessings,
And grant me the attainment of unimpeded wisdom!
Garab Dorje, Śrī Siṃha, Mañjuśrīmitra,
Jñānasūtra and Vimalamitra,
To you I pray: Inspire me with your blessings,
And grant me the attainment of unimpeded wisdom!
The miraculously born master Padmasambhava,
Yeshe Tsogyal, lord and subjects and vidyādharas,
To you I pray: Inspire me with your blessings,
And grant me the attainment of unimpeded wisdom!
Great prince Trinlé Lingpa,
Vidyādhara gurus of the three transmissions,
To you I pray: Inspire me with your blessings,
And grant me the attainment of unimpeded wisdom!
By the power and blessings of praying with devotion
To the gathering of deities of the Three Roots,
May there be favorable conditions for the Dharma and the fulfilment of my wishes!
And may all unfavorable circumstances and obstacles be dispelled!
Once all the supreme and ordinary siddhis
Are effortlessly accomplished in this very life,
May I perfect the qualities of the paths and bhūmis,
And easily attain the state in which
There is no separation between Vajradhāra, Guru,
And the Protector Mañjughoṣa, I pray!

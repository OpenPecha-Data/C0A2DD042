A Spontaneous Vajra Song 1
Respectfully I bow before the noble father-guru.
Listen child, noble Yeshe Drön—Wisdom Light.
In the vast empty vessel of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
I light the lamp of primordially pure wisdom.
I offer the gift of naturally luminous dharmatā.
Grant the siddhi of the five wisdoms and kāyas.
In the vessel of primordially pure awareness,
I light the lamp of spontaneously present luminosity.
I offer the gift of freedom from any notion of exertion.
Grant the siddhi of perfecting the four visions.
In the vessel of the luminous visions,
I light the lamp of the kāyas and wisdoms.
I offer the gift of primordially pure, profound clarity.
Grant the siddhi of the great exhaustion of phenomena.
In the vessel of phenomenal exhaustion beyond the mind,
I light the lamp of the indivisible three kāyas.
I offer the gift of emptying saṃsāra from its depths.
Grant the siddhi of consummate benefit to others.
Through this vajra song of sonic emptiness
Expressing whatever arose spontaneously,
May beings caught in dualistic delusion
Enter the expanse that is free from duality.

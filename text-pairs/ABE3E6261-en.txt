The Prayer that Swiftly Fulfils All Wishes (Sampa Nyur Drupma)
Emaho! In the heart of a blossoming lotus, upon the waters of the lake,
You are the deity who is the spontaneous presence of the five kāyas and wisdoms,
O great, naturally arisen Padma Yabyum
Surrounded by clouds of ḍākinīs—to you we pray:
Grant your blessing so that all our wishes be quickly fulfilled!
As a result of our negative karma, whenever we suffer
From illness, malevolent spirits ( döns ) and obstacles, warfare and violence, famine and starvation,
Then remember your promise that even simply to think of you will immediately dissolve all such suffering—
O Lord of Orgyen, we implore you, from the depths of our hearts,
Grant your blessing so that all our wishes be quickly fulfilled!
To practise devotion, discipline and generosity,
To free the mind through hearing the Dharma, and to have dignity, self-control
And discriminating awareness—make these seven noble human qualities
Fill the hearts and minds of all sentient beings
And so bring peace and happiness to the world.
Grant your blessing so that all our wishes be quickly fulfilled!
When oppressed by illness, suffering and unwanted circumstances,
Falling prey to harm from negative forces and punishment from kings and leaders,
Threatened by fire, water, vicious animals, and journeys of great danger,
When this life is spent and death arrives—at these times
We have nowhere to turn to except to you!
Care for us with your great compassion, O great Orgyen Guru:
Grant your blessing so that all our wishes be quickly fulfilled!

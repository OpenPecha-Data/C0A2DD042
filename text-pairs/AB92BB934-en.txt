Excellent Intention: A Simple Fasting (Nyungné) Ritual
The ground is purified with scented water and strewn with flowers.
It is adorned with Sumeru, the king of mountains, the four quarters of the universe, and the sun and the moon;
Thinking of it as the blessed buddha-fields, I offer it.
By virtue of this offering, may all beings here and now attain the happiness of that pure land!
I prostrate myself, make offerings, confess,
Rejoice, request the teachings and implore you to remain.
Whatever slight virtue I have here amassed,
I dedicate entirely towards great, perfect awakening!
I take refuge in the Three Jewels,
Confess all my wrongdoing and non-virtuous actions,
Rejoice in the virtues of beings,
And maintain the mind of awakening to buddhahood.
Just as the arhats of former times,
To benefit ordinary beings,
And to perfect enlightened qualities,
Would practise sojong (healing and purification),
Just so, I, the one whose name is ___,
Shall, from now until sunrise tomorrow,
Take up the practice of sojong .
From this moment on, I shall not take life,
Nor lie, have sexual intercourse, or take what is not given.
I shall give up alcohol, which is the source of all faults,
Avoid high, luxurious seats, taking food at improper times,
Wearing perfumed scents or ornaments and singing or dancing.
Through relying on this eightfold vow,
May I attain liberation!
Unspoilt by defects, your body is white,
Your crown is adorned with the perfect buddha,
And with eyes of compassion you gaze on all beings—
Avalokiteśvara, to you I pay homage!
Your thousand arms are the thousand universal monarchs,
Your thousand eyes the thousand buddhas of this fortunate age,
You who teach each and every one of us according to our needs,
Noble Avalokiteśvara, to you I pay homage!

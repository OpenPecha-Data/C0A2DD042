Seven-Branch Offering to Tārā 1. Prostration 2. Offering 3. Confession 4. Rejoicing 5. Imploring the Buddhas to Turn the Wheel of Dharma 6. Requesting the Buddhas Not to Enter nirvāṇa 7. Dedication
To the Exalted Ārya, the Noble Lady Tārā,
And to all the victorious ones and their heirs
Dwelling in all directions of the universe, through past, present and future,
Sincerely and enthusiastically I pay homage!
I make offerings of flowers, incense, lamps, fragrant scents,
And food, and music, and the like —
Both physical and imaginary, created by the mind.
Assembly of Noble Ladies, please accept them all!
All my negative deeds throughout beginningless time until today,
The ten non-virtues and the five with immediate reckoning —
Sprung from this mind that is driven by destructive emotions,
I confess them all, each and every one.
With a heart full of delight, I rejoice in all the merits
Of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas,
And every living being,
Throughout the three times.
I implore you: according to the temperament
And mental capacity of sentient beings,
Please turn the wheel of Dharma
Of all the vehicles — lesser, greater, and general.
Until saṃsāra has been completely emptied,
I beseech you: do not pass into nirvāṇa,
But look upon us with your boundless compassion,
As we flounder in this ocean of suffering.
May whatever virtue I have amassed
Become the cause of enlightenment for all;
May I quickly, without delay or deferment,
Become an excellent guide to all beings.

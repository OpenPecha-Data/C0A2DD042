Aspiration Prayer from The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel: A Sādhana of Yeshe Tsogyal as Noble Tārā
Oṃ! May this be accomplished, O compassionate and Noble Tārā.
Through the power and blessings of this practice of approach and accomplishment,
Offerings and praise, and prayers made to you, Noble Tārā,
From this moment on, until we reach awakening,
May we never be separated from you, Noble Saviouress,
May we have good health and long life, and may our wangtang and resources increase.
May there be no obstacles to our accomplishing awakening,
And may we swiftly perfect the qualities of the paths and bhūmis.
May we attain omniscience and complete enlightenment,
Spontaneously benefiting ourselves and others.

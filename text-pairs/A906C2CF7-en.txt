A Method of Purifying Samaya Violations by Relying on the Glorious Guru Vajrasattva
Upon a lotus and moon disc at the center of my heart
Is the glorious Vajrasattva, my root Guru,
Pure white in color, holding vajra and bell and with the dress of a saṃbhogakāya,
In union with the consort, Vajragarvā of great bliss. 1
From their bodies, a white stream of amṛta and rays of light flow down filling my entire body.
Through this, all sicknesses, evil influences, misdeeds, obscurations
And violations of samaya are completely purified.
And I obtain the vajra body of great bliss and equanimity.
Oṃ vajrasattva hūṃ

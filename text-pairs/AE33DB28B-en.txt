Bestowing the Splendour of All That is Desirable Fire Offering for the 'Neck-Pouch Dagger’ (Purba Gulkhukma) Cycle
Ho. These offering substances that delight the six senses,
Which are, in essence, immaculate wisdom
And in appearance, the offering clouds of Samantabhadra,
Arise, billowing, to delight the great and glorious Heruka.
Raṃ. Agnideva, deity of wisdom fire, and Pāṇḍaravāsinī—
Blazing expanse like the fires at the end of the aeon,
Great and glorious heruka in the form of a Vajrarakṣa,
Awesome, fearsome Vajrakīla,
Complete with all your ornaments and accoutrements,
In the citadel of vajra power,
Enjoy as adornments these sensory pleasures and delights:
May they please and satisfy you!
Swiftly bring about our aims,
Whatever we wish for in our minds!
Oṃ vajra kīlaya sapārivāra mahāpūja khāhi khāhi sarva siddhi phala hūṃ

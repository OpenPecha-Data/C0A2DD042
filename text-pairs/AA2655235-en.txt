A Sādhana of Mārīcī 1 Refuge & Bodhicitta Main Part Conclusion
In the Buddha, the Dharma and the Supreme Assembly
I take refuge until I attain enlightenment.
Through the merit of practising generosity and so on,
May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of all beings.
Instantaneously, out of the state of emptiness,
Upon a chariot drawn by four [golden] sows,
In the heart of a lotus and moon disc,
Arises Mārīcī out of the syllable Māṃ.
She is golden in colour, wears jewel ornaments,
And is clothed in upper and lower garments of silk.
Her right hand is in the gesture of supreme giving
And holds the branch of an aśoka plant,
While her left hand holds a needle and thread.
From her radiant heart centre she emanates
Countless forms, identical to herself,
Who utterly annihilate enemies, negative influences, obstacle-makers,
And harmdoers—material and immaterial—so that not even their names remain.
oṃ mārīcyai mūṃ svāhā
Through the merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Mārīcī,
And thereby may every single sentient being
Reach this state of perfection too.

Prayer to the Garland of Rebirths of the Dzogchenpas of Eastern Tibet
The dharmatā nature is beyond arising and ceasing and past, present and future,
Yet still you appear in the two form kāyas 1 within the realms of sentient beings—
Marvellous buddha Ratnaśikhī,
Whose name alone liberates from the lower realms: to you I pray!
Kukkurīpāda, master of infinite classes of tantra,
Vimalamitra, who achieved the vajra state of great transference,
And Saraha, who realized the Great Seal beyond conceptual elaboration,
To these three fountainheads of the teachings, I pray!
Śrī Siṃha, who bound gods and spirits into servitude,
Könchok Jungné, 2 who destroyed the delusory appearances of rocks and mountains,
And Tri Ralpachen, who caused the buddha’s teachings to shine like the sun,
To these three allies of the teachings, I pray!
Paktsangwa, 3 who attained realization through bringing ignorance onto the path,
Changchub Gyalpo, 4 who became a heart-son of Mila Shyepe Dorje,
And Düsum Khyenpa, 5 illusory manifestation of Senge, the sixth guide,
To these three supremely accomplished ones, I pray!
Lingjé Répa, 6 who freed his mind through realization,
Taklung Thangpa, 7 who perfected devotion for the guru,
And Orgyen Rangjungpa, 8 who mastered yogic discipline:
To these three holders of the teachings from the practice lineage, I pray!
Stable in the three foundational practices and with excellent intellect,
You perfected the force of aspirations to spread the Nyingma teachings in Kham,
Pema Rigdzin, 9 holder of awareness in Padma’s line,
And Gyurme Thekchok Tendzin Pal Zangpo, 10 to you I pray!
And Ngedön Tendzin Zangpo, 11 who established traditions
Of great accomplishment-practices for the Kama traditions,
Such as the fundamental teachings of the Early Translations: the Sūtra, Illusory Web and Mind, 12
And Yangphur (Viśuddha and Vajrakīla) and Sangye Nyamjor—to you, I pray!
Inspire us with your blessings, so that we may prepare our minds with renunciation,
And then, drawn along on the chariot of twofold bodhicitta,
Realize, in this very lifetime, all the accomplishments born of stable familiarity
With the supreme path of ripening and liberation!

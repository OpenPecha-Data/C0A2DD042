54. The Method to Pacify All Epidemics, Illnesses and Pandemics From the Sixty Solitary Forms of Yamāntaka
I appear as Yamāntaka, the Vajra Pacifier of All Illness,
Green in colour, with three eyes, and smiling with a hint of wrath.
As I bear my fangs, a five-coloured wisdom wind emerges from my nose
And eradicates all forms of suffering.
My upper body is naked but for ornaments of bone,
My lower body wreathed in a garment of red silk.
My two hands rest in a gesture of meditation
And cradle a delicate vase filled with medicinal nectar.
With my two legs standing in a posture of evenness,
I appear vividly clear amidst the brilliance of wisdom fire.
White Mañjuśrī sits at my heart wearing the ornaments of the saṃbhogakāya and holding a vase filled with nectar. Within the precious enclosure of his heart
Is a white syllable Hūṃ standing on a moon disk.
It is encircled by a mantra arranged like a constellation of stars.
The light of the garland performs the twofold purpose;
Its moonlight radiance in particular,
Filled with a pure, cooling nectar,
Heals and purifies all epidemics, illnesses and pandemics,
Along with their respective causes and conditions for myself and others.
It induces the wisdom of bliss and emptiness
And renders evident the uncontaminated vajra-kāya
That is naturally free of ageing and decay.

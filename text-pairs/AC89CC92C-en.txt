Swift Infusion of Blessings A Guru Yoga Based on Jamgön Mipham Gyatso
I take refuge in the supreme guru,
Who embodies all sources of refuge without exception.
To attain perfect awakening for others’ sake,
I shall meditate on the yoga of the guru.
Ah. Environment and inhabitants are utterly pure, the heaven of Akaniṣṭha,
Where, amidst an expanse of bountiful clouds of offerings,
In the sky before me, upon a lion-throne and discs of sun and moon,
Is the omniscient guru, Mipham Namgyal,
Brilliant white, smiling handsomely, and dressed as a paṇḍita.
His hands, in the dharma-teaching mudrā, hold a sword and book.
He is seated in the vajra posture and gazes into space.
At the three seats within his body, all maṇḍalas are complete.
Merely to think of him causes pristine wisdom to arise.
Vivid and clear, he is the embodiment of all sources of refuge.
Before the gracious guru in whom all sources of refuge are contained,
I prostrate myself in devotion, make offerings, confess misdeeds and downfalls,
Rejoice in virtue and request the teachings,
And I dedicate all the virtue of my prayers toward all beings’ attainment of omniscience.
The wisdom of Mañjuśrī, Lion of Speech, arose in your heart,
And you trained in the infinite aspirations of Samantabhadra,
Performing the enlightened actions of the buddhas and their heirs:
Jampal Gyepé Dorje, to you I pray!
Through the power of gaining certainty that my own pure awareness is the guru’s very essence,
May I unlock the treasury of perfect recollection, confident eloquence and intelligence,
And gain the capacity to illumine the teachings of the victorious ones through debate, explanation and composition.
Inspire me with your blessings, O supreme protector, so that I may become your equal!
oṃ āḥ guru mañjuśrī ajita sarva siddhi phala hūṃ
From the three vajra syllables at the guru’s three centres, rays of light shine out
And dissolve into my own three centres; through this I receive the four empowerments,
Purify the four obscurations, and gain the conditions to train in the four paths,
So that the seeds of the four kāyas are planted in my mind!
Finally, the guru melts into light and dissolves into me.
His wisdom becomes one with my own mind, and my potential for realization is perfected.
Here is the already liberated genuine nature, blissful and beyond the ordinary mind,
Unaltered, the expanse of the Great Perfection: Ah!

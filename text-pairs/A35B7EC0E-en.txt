The Drumbeat of Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of the Great Tertön Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje
Oṃ svasti!
From the white blessing clouds of knowledge, love and power
Of the Lake-born Lord, mighty and victorious embodiment of the Three Roots,
Let flower-like rains of benefit and happiness descend
To bring auspiciousness, virtue and positivity to the three worlds.
Supreme nirmāṇakāya emanation of the vidyādhara Dudjom,
Who was the crowning adornment of a hundred adepts
And a magical manifestation of the unique wisdom
Of the Oḍḍiyāna Lord and Drokben Lotsāwa, 1 may your life remain secure!
Without fear of existence or quiescence and with all your aims fulfilled,
Honoured by millions of gods, humans, nāgas and vidyādharas,
May you remain forever upon the dharma throne
As you train the unruly who are so difficult to tame.
The fresh, brightly shining sun of your discerning wisdom
Is pulled by the seven horses of intense love and compassion, 2
Overpowering darkness throughout existence and peace—
Great and heroic Vajra in Hand, may your life remain secure!
May the secret body, speech and mind of Padma’s great messenger
And representative remain forever sublime,
Bringing magnificence, happiness and wellbeing
To the beings of this world especially in the Land of Snows.
May you live long, displaying the illusory, magical dance
Of the supreme yogic discipline of bliss and emptiness,
And opening a hundred doors to profound treasures,
Thereby revealing an extensive treasury of Dharma.
May you set fortunate disciples on the path to liberation,
Carry out infinite activity for the benefit of others,
Pacify the menacing attacks of dark demonic forces,
And usher in the brilliant dawn of a perfect age of excellence!

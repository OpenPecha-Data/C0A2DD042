Emaho! Previously, in the aeon of the Illuminating King Bhāskara,
You were Pāṇḍarāvasinī, Clad in White—Iśvara’s divine daughter, .
Training on the path, you renounced saṃsāra and attained true awakening.

You brought hundreds of thousands of nuns to perfect awakening.
Mandāravā, at your feet I pray!
At the time of Buddha Śākyamuni’s teachings, you manifested twenty-five emanations;
Your re-emanations were inconceivable, defying the imagination.
You flung wide every door to the Secret Mantra’s path of liberation.

You emanated Secret Mantra teachers by the trillion.
And to accompany each of these you sent your ḍākinī emanations.

Out among the flowers, you met the master of Uḍḍiyāna.
Leading him to his throne, you requested the Dharma.
A cowherd noticed, and slander began to spread, And the king took action to have the two of you punished.
Mandāravā, at your feet I pray!
They tried to burn Padmākara alive, but he thwarted them with miracles.
Ashamed and sad, king and ministers repented, And the Guru was invited to live with the king and queen.

Taming the beings of the twenty-five lands solely through miracles.

Mandāravā, at your feet I pray!
Next, you left for Bhejé, to Slate Rock mountain peak,
Where the remaining instructions in their entirety were bestowed to perfection.

You departed to Padmavyūhā, Lotus Array
Where you became the supreme consort, Guhyajñānā, Secret Wisdom.

You dissolved into rainbow body and sent emanations to benefit beings.

Thus shall we attain complete liberation and awakening!

Bless us, that all our wishes be quickly fulfilled!
Others’ benefit accomplished, may saṃsāra be emptied!
Through your blessing, may we all accomplish the Victorious Mother!

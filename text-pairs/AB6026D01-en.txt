Rain of Siddhis: A Prayer to the Lineage of Rigdzin Düpa
Samantabhadra and Vajrasattva, lords of a hundred buddha families,
Prahevajra, 1 regent of Vajradhara,
Mañjuśrīmitra, you who attained the supreme siddhi,
To you I pray: bestow on me the vajra wisdom!
The learned Śrī Siṃha, who perfected the yogic disciplines,
Jñanasūtra, who attained the immaculate rainbow body,
Vimalamitra, pioneer of the essence of the supreme yāna,
To you I pray: bestow on me the vajra wisdom!
Padmākara, master over the ocean of maṇḍalas,
King Trisong Detsen, emanation of Mañjuśrī,
Vairocana and Yeshe Tsogyal, who dispelled the darkness in the Land of Snows,
To you I pray: bestow on me the vajra wisdom!
Omniscient Drimé Özer, 2 who deciphered the secret symbols of the Nyingtik,
Vidyādhara Jigdral Lingpa, 3 who was authorized with the transmission of the profound terma,
Kunzang Shyenpen, 4 emanation of the prince Murum Tsenpo,
To you I pray: bestow on me the vajra wisdom!
Gyalwé Nyugu, holder of the treasury of instructions,
Dongak Lingpa, 5 universal king of learning and practice,
Root master, in all your incomparable kindness,
To you I pray: bestow on me the vajra wisdom!
May my mind be ripened through the anointing water of the vase of royal empowerment,
May general, specific and special samayas be completely pure,
By perfecting all the crucial points of the five samādhis and four hidden instructions,
May the profound generation stage create the foundation,
And through the perfection stage of the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel of the Oral Lineage ,
And the path of the messenger-consort known as Buddhahood Without Meditation ,
May the aggregates and elements be purified into unobstructed space,
And ripen into the indestructible rainbow body of five-coloured light!

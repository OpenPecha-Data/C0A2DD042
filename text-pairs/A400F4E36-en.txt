Aspiration for the Long Life of Jampa Kunga Tenpé Nyima
Namo guru mañjughoṣāya!
Illuminator of the teachings of Kunga Yeshe, 1
Who was a second Maitreyanātha, an erudite master of Dharma,
Protector of beings, lord of knowledge, love and power,
Sun among teachers, may your life remain secure!
May your mind be enriched by the pure threefold vows,
May you reach perfection in multifaceted study, reflection and meditation,
May you spend all your time teaching, debating and composing,
And may your virtuous activity always flourish!
Supreme emanation, may you remain for a hundred aeons.
May all your enlightened aspirations be spontaneously fulfilled,
And may the sun of the teachings of the venerable Sakyapa,
Lord of wisdom, blaze throughout the world!

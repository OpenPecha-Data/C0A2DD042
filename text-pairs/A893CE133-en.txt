Concise Daily Practice of Vajrasattva Refuge & Bodhicitta Main Part Mantra Recitation Dedication
Namo! Precious Guru, the lord of all families,
Divine Yidam, the source of all siddhis,
Ḍākinī, the dispeller of all obstacles—
In the Three Roots, I take refuge!
Ho! In order for all mother sentient beings
To obtain the state of a fully enlightened buddha,
I promise to abandon all misdeeds, accumulate merit,
And always cultivate bodhicitta for others' sake.
Ā! Vajrasattva, great space,
Unobtainable through grasping, like the moon in water.
As the emanation of Samantabhadra,
You are the main deity, the union of wisdom and method,
A heroic being, white in color, and holding vajra and bell,
Embracing the consort of innate luminosity, the union of bliss and emptiness,
And adorned with silk and jewel ornaments.
From the state of the unfabricated nature,
The peaceful deities appear at the main deity's heart
And wrathful deities appear vividly at his crown.
At his heart, upon discs of sun and moon
Is the syllable Hūṃ surrounded by a garland of mantra,
From which light rays radiate, then return, performing two kinds of benefit
And pacifying transgressions and obscurations of awareness into space.
The entire outer and inner world arises as deity, mantra and wisdom
Of the countless peaceful and wrathful deities.
oṃ vajrasatva āḥ
oṃ bodhicitta mahāsukha jñānadhātu āḥ
oṃ rulu rulu hūṃ bhyo hūm
Through this merit, may I swiftly accomplish
The state of Vajrasattva,
And may I establish every sentient being without exception
In that perfect state as well.

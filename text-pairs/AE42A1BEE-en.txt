Prayer to Orgyen Rinpoche Invoking His Wisdom Mind
Glorious embodiment of the enlightened activity of all the victorious buddhas throughout space and time,
Orgyen Rinpoche, to you I pray!
With unbearably intense and fervent longing, I call out from the depths of my heart.
Look upon us from the unmanifest realm with your eyes of compassion!
In this life, the next life and the bardo state,
Hold us, PadmƒÅkara, in your compassion without ever parting!
O Orgyen, care for me!
Orgyen, care for me!
Orgyen, care for me!
Gracious Orgyen, care for me!
Benevolent Orgyen, care for me!
Blessed Orgyen, care for me!
Compassionate Orgyen, care for me!

The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra Taking Refuge in the Three Jewel
Homage to the Three Jewels
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was residing at Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī, together with a great saṅgha of , monks
At that time, while the venerable Śāradvatīputra was alone in the forest
this thought arose in his mind
“I should go before the Teacher so that I can ask the Blissful One, the Dharma Lord, this question
‘How much merit is accumulated by faithful noble sons or noble daughters who take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha of monks?’ 
At dusk the venerable Śāriputra emerged from his meditative seclusion an
went to see the Blessed One
When he arrived, he bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side
While seated to the side, the venerable Śāriputra asked the Blessed One
“Honored One, while I was staying alone in the forest in meditative seclusion
this thought arose in my mind
‘How much merit is accumulated by faithful noble sons or noble daughters who take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha of monks?’ 
The Blessed One replied to the venerable Śāriputra
“Śāriputra, you have asked this question in order to benefit and bring happiness to many beings
Out of love for the world, you seek to help a vast number of beings, gods and humans alike, by accomplishing their welfare and happiness
That is excellent, excellent
Śāriputra, as you have thought to come an
question the Thus-Gone One about this matter, I will reply with an analogy to make you understand
“Imagine that someone endowed with magical powers were to transfer into another world all the beings that live in Jambudvīpa—the land of Jambudvīpa and its subcontinents, which measure seven thousand leagues across and lengthwise
Having made the ground even like the palm of a hand
that person would then build a stūpa made of the seven precious gems—gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red coral, emerald, and white coral. It would be the size of Jambudvīpa, and its summit would reach the Brahmā realms
That person would then worship that stūpa with offerings of divine incense, divine flowers, divine garlands, and divine parasols, banners, and flags
This person endowed with these magical power
would then pour all the water of the four great oceans into another world system an
replace it with four oceans filled with maruka oil
He would then place a wick the size of Mount Sumeru into the oceans so that for many eons this oil lamp would continuously burn
“Śāriputra, tell me, would that person accumulate a lot of merit on that basis?
“Blessed One, yes, a lot
Blissful One, yes, a lot
That person would surpass all the hearers and solitary buddhas
Blessed One, this is the domain of the thus-gone ones
Blissful One, this is the domain of the thus-gone ones.
“Śāriputra, that amount of merit would not match even a hundredth, a thousandth, or even a hundred thousandth of the merit created by a noble son or noble daughter who takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. This difference could not be illustrated by any numbers, examples, or calculations.
When this Dharma teaching was given, the whole great trichiliocosm began to quiver, tremble, quake, wobble, rock, sway, vibrate, shudder, and reel
Great lightning flashes struck, an
the gods caused the sound of drums to be heard
The venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teaching
How should it be remembered?
The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, you should remember this Dharma teaching as Accomplishing Limitless Gateways
This is how you should see its meaning, an
this is how you should remember it.
When the Blessed One had spoken
the venerable Śāriputra and the other monks praised the Blessed One’s words
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels.

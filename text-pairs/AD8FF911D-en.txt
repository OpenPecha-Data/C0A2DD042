Making Great Bliss the Path Visualisation and Mantra Recitation of Medicine Buddha
Namo Guru Padmākarāya!
Hūṃ! On the basis of the natural state, unaltered, and beyond the limits of conceptualization,
Arises the Medicine Buddha of great bliss,
Blue-black in colour, peacefully smiling, and blazing amidst a mass of light.
His right hand is in the mudrā of supreme generosity and holds the king of medicines;
His left hand rests in the mudrā of equipoise and cradles an alms-bowl.
Replete with the marks and signs, and nirmāṇakāya ornaments,
He sits with legs crossed upon a lotus and moon.
At his heart, upon a lotus and a moon-disc,
Is a syllable hūṃ, encircled by the mantra.
Reciting the mantra stirs saṃsāra from its very depths!
oṃ namo bhagavate bhaiṣajyaguru vaiḍūryaprabharājāya | tathāgatāya arahate samyaksambuddhāya | tadyathā | oṃ bhaiṣajye bhaiṣajye mahābhaiṣajya-rāja-samudgate svāhā
Namo! All-pervasive, all-knowing and all-seeing,
Medicine Buddha, dispeller of suffering and sickness,
A treasury of noble qualities, wisdoms and bodies—
To you, the perfect glory, I offer homage and praise!

Confession and Fulfilment Insert for Accumulating the Practice of Turning Back the Summons of the Ḍākinīs
From every sacred land and place of power,
From all the cities of ḍākas and ḍākinīs,
Throughout the vast cosmos of Gangchen Tso,
You ḍākinīs in your huge throng,
In families: Vajra, Ratna, Padma and Karma, in your hundreds of thousands—come now to this place!
With these sense offerings and stimulants
And with this tsok feast, all your sacred wishes are fulfilled!
We confess and heal all impairments and breakages
In the vows and samayas of the three yānas, and of the vidyādharas!
For this supreme master who resides here,
This great torch of the ocean-like teaching of Buddha,
This protector and friend to every sentient being:
Dispel all dangers to life and obstacles into space!
Turn back the summons of the ḍākas and ḍākinīs!
Let everything be auspicious for a life that is secure and long!

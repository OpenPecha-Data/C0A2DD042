Invoking the Blessings of the Kagyü Lineage—‘Dorjechang Thungma’
Great Vajradhara, Tilopa and Nāropa,
Marpa, Milarepa, and Gampopa, lord of Dharma,
You who know all past, present and future—the Karmapa,
Holders of the four earlier and eight later lineages,
Drikung, Taklung, Tsalpa, the glorious Drukpa and the rest,
Masters of the profound path of Mahāmudrā,
Unequalled protectors of beings, the Dakpo Kagyü,
To all of you, the Kagyü lamas, I pray: inspire me
With your blessing to uphold this lineage, and follow you to liberation.
Revulsion for saṃsāra is the feet of meditation; so it is taught.
Free of craving and attachment to things like food and wealth,
Having severed the ties to this life, inspire this meditator
With your blessing, to be rid of addiction to possessions and fame.
Devotion is the head of meditation; so it is taught.
The lama opens the door to the treasure of the pith instructions;
Praying constantly to him, inspire this meditator
With your blessing, so that uncontrived devotion is born within me.
Non-distraction is the main body of meditation; so it is taught.
Whatever arises, in that very essence of thought, fresh, natural,
Unaltered—leaving it just there, inspire this meditator
With your blessing, so my meditation is free from conceptual mind.
The nature of thoughts is dharmakāya; so it is taught.
They are nothing whatsoever, yet appear as anything at all,
Arising as an unceasing display; inspire this meditator
With your blessing, to realize that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not separate.
In all my lives, may I never be separate
From the perfect lama, and so enjoy the splendour of Dharma;
Mastering completely the qualities of the path and stages,
May I swiftly attain the sublime state of Vajradhara.

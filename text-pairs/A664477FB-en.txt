A Prayer 1
O Lord Guru, embodiment of all the oceanic sources of refuge,
Together with vidyādharas, ḍākinīs, oath-bound dharma protectors and their retinues,
I fervently and one-pointedly pray to you:
Please pacify outer, inner and secret obstacles into space,
Help me overcome the eight fears, untimely death and enemies,
And cause all my aspirations to be fulfilled just as I wish!

Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Dodrupchen Rinpoche
Luminous dharmakāya, pure from the very beginning,
Its ceaseless self-radiance, spontaneous sambhogakāya,
And compassion’s manifestations in every possible form—
Infinite hosts of refuge deities, grant us excellence!
Let this one who painstakingly laid a foundation for the teachings,
Who renounced the concerns of this life, practised genuine Dharma,
And entirely fulfilled the hopes and wishes of sublime masters,
Becoming a splendour of the teachings and beings, swiftly reappear!

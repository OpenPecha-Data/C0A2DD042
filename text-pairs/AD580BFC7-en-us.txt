The Noble Dhāraṇī of Parṇaśavar
Homage to the noble Parṇaśavarī
Homage to the Three Jewels
Homage to the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, the blessed Amitābha
Homage to the bodhisattva great being, the deeply compassionate and noble Avalokiteśvara
Homage to the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmaprāpta
Homage to you, blessed Parṇaśavarī, dwarfish piśācī who wields an axe and a noose
Whatever fears may arise, every plague, pestilence, and pandemic, all calamities and conflicts, and all personal anxieties affect only the foolish, not the wise
May truth, words of truth, and true speech send them away and dispel them
May these words of mantra empowered by the wise guard me and all beings
May they protect us, keep us secure, defend us, and bring us peace and good fortune
May they protect us from punishment and weapons
May they neutralize all poisons
May they protect from the dangers of fire and the dangers of water
May they cut down kākhordas
May they establish the protective boundary and bind the earth
The dhāraṇī is: amṛte amṛte amṛtodbhave amṛta­sambhave āśvaste āśvastāṅge mā mara mā mara mā sara mā sara
Grant peace
Pacify every illness
Bring an end to all kinds of untimely death
Pacify all evil influences from the planets and stars
Pacify all venom
O Blessed Parṇaśavarī
tunna tunna vitunna vitunna tuṇa tuṇa tumule svāhā. oṃ gauri gāndhāri caṇḍāli mātaṅgi pukkasi svāhā. oṃ aṅkure māṅkure kurare parṇa­śavari svāhā. namas sarva­śavarīṇām mahā­śavarīṇām bhagavati piśāci parṇa­śavari piśāci svāhā. oṃ piśāci parṇaśavari hrīḥ jaḥ hūṃ phaṭ piśāci svāhā

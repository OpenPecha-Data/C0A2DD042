Brief Confession to the Earth Lords 1
Kye! Whatever we practitioners and our patrons
Have done towards the devas, nāgas and nyen spirits, 2
Including the actions of our ancestors from the past,
And of our descendants in the future—
Transgressions, such as digging up the spirits of the earth, raising the spirits of stone, 3
Stirring the spirits of water, cutting the spirits of trees,
Disturbing burial ground and funeral rites, and the like—
Whatever we have done in our ignorance, 4
We hereby declare and confess: may it all be purified!

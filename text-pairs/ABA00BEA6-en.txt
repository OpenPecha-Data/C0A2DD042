A Daily Practice of Buddha Akṣobhya
I visualize myself as the Bhagavān Akṣobhya,
Complete with the major and minor marks and in nirmāṇakāya garb,
And seated upon a throne supported by elephants.
At my heart, upon a moon-disc, is a blue hūṃ,
Around which the mantra rotates to the right,
Sending out powerful rays of deep blue light.
Through this, I visualize, the karmic obscurations
Of all sentient beings, especially of those who have passed away,
Disappear entirely, just like frost in sunlight!

The Fulfilment of All Aims and Wishes An Aspiration to Request the Safeguarding of Happiness in Tibet
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
All the victors and their heirs throughout the ten directions and three times,
But especially the peerless teacher, king of the Śākyas,
The eight close sons, sthavira hierarchs,
Six ornaments of this world and two marvellous ācāryas,
Eight vidyādharas, eighty-four mahāsiddhas,
And the vidyādhara Padmasambhava who embodies them all,
His eight supreme manifestations and forty secondary emanations,
As well as the two ḍākinīs, twenty-five disciples,
Śāntarakṣita, the second lord of sages, Atiśa,
And all the learned and accomplished vidyādharas of the New and Ancient traditions,
The hundred emanated treasure-revealers,
And all the many millions of vidyādhara gurus,
As well as the inconceivable maṇḍalas of peaceful and wrathful deities
Of the four classes of tantra, especially the eight sādhana classes,
The glorious Assembled Word, Embodiment of the Guru’s Intention,
Sūtra Combining All Intentions, Illusory Net, Wheel of Time and so on,
Noble Tārā, who is swift and valiant,
Vajravārāhī, Siṃhamukhā, vīras of the three domains,
And all the thousands and millions of glorious yoginīs,
As well as the five classes of Gönpo and Maning and Shingkyong,
The Mantra Protectress, Rāhula, Damchen Dorje Lekpa,
The thirty commanders of the haughty spirits, and so on,
All the oath-bound ones of the three tantra classes, together with their retinues, the hosts of arrogant spirits,
And the seventy-five lords of pure lineage,
Together with Vaiśravaṇa, Jambhala, and an ocean of wealth deities,
As well as the Five Sisters of Long Life, Tenma goddesses, deities of the upper slopes,
And all those guardians of virtue who delight in the teachings,
Together with local protectors and the great keepers of treasures, and the rest—
In short, we invoke the compassion of the infinite deities of the Three Roots,
As well as their blessings, power and strength and the force of truth.
Now that we have reached the end of this period of fivefold degeneration,
The sun of happiness is setting upon the teachings and beings;
Holders of the teachings and benefactors have been reduced
To the ranks of common folk and lost their authority and influence;
And the curative Wheel of Dharma is on the verge of destruction.
Have all of you lost the power of your noble aspirations?
Can you not hear our fervent prayers of devotion,
With which you we call out to you, day and night?
Now, let us summon the valorous forces of compassion
To protect what has not been destroyed by the forces of evil,
For what would be the point of acting only when it’s all no more?
Thus, let the might of your activity of the three secrets
Blaze forth just like the infernos at the end of time, we pray!
And since the forceful Guru Padma, in particular,
Vowed to afford protection from the terrors of invasion
In hidden lands, snowy peaks and mountain sanctuaries,
Let us see if this commitment was more than mere falsehood.
According to the aspirations made in the past
And the infallible prophecies of gurus and ḍākinīs,
Reveal for us now, swiftly and without hindrance,
The hidden lands wherein holders of the teachings
And faithful men and women may find relief!
Let Dorje Drolö, king of the wrathful conquerors of Māra,
Who blazes like a fire of red-hot iron,
Naturally pacify all forms of harm and adversity and fulfil our every wish,
At the very moment that we bring him to mind.
Let Guru Padmākara lead the way,
The dharma protectors and guardians defend us from behind,
And all the forces of virtue offer their assistance!
May we gain the splendour of victory over Māra,
May our lifespan, merit and resources all increase,
And may our qualities of scriptural learning and realization
Develop further and further, just like the waxing moon!
May all harmful circumstances in the outer and inner world be pacified,
May outer, inner and secret positivity be spontaneously accomplished,
May all that seems harmful be transformed into virtue and auspiciousness,
And may all be auspicious so that fortune prevails in perfect abundance!
May the Three Jewels and oceanic Three Roots grant their blessings,
So that this aspiration may be fulfilled just as we wish.
By the utterly pure nature of dharmatā —reality-as-such,
And the unfailing interdependence of conditioned things,
May all be brought within our power through the force of truth,
And the teachings of the omniscient Victorious One spread far and wide!

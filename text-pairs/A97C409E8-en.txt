The Magical Wish-Fulfilling Tree A Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
Oṃ svasti.
All living beings, even up to and including the gods,
Bow down and touch the crowns of their heads at your lotus feet.
You who are a manifestation of the noble Lord of the World,
Great guide, mighty conqueror, may your life remain secure.
With the radiant light of the Holder of the White Lotus,
You bring benefit and happiness to the teachings and beings of this world,
And, as you spontaneously accomplish vast enlightened activity,
Like a magical wish-granting tree or wish-fulfilling jewel, may your life remain secure.
You whose form is as resplendent as a mountain of gold,
Lofty with the terraces of the four boundless qualities
And adorned with the pendants of the perfections and means of gathering—
Lord of speech, deity of deities, may your life remain secure.
You whose conduct resembles that of the arhat Upāli;
You who are overflowing with the nectar of bodhicitta,
And have reached the summit of the vajra vehicle's sovereign methods—
Noble-minded Vajradhara, may your life remain secure.
As through exposition, you enthral millions upon millions of learned scholars,
Through debate, you bring down the rocky mountains of wrong views,
And through composition, you forge sacred monuments to illuminate the teachings—
Tenzin Gyatso, may your life remain secure for a hundred aeons.
You who are entirely unrivalled throughout the three planes of existence,
Supreme sovereign and master of Dharma in this world of Jambudvīpa,
Perfectly and utterly victorious one beyond all compare,
May your lotus feet remain secure upon the vajra throne, I pray.

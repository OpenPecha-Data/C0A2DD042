The Melody of Complete Accomplishment A Prayer to Those Praised as Ornaments of the Practice Lineage
Homage to the transcendent conqueror Vajrasattva!
With great courage, you travelled many times to the Noble Land of India.
With great intelligence, you realised the true nature of all things.
With great mastery, you displayed all manner of miracles.
To you, Great LotsƒÅwa, I pray!
With great power, you annihilated your enemies.
With great austerities, you pleased the Guru.
With great diligence, you planted the victory banner of practice.
To you, Great Repa, I pray!
You awakened the supreme disposition of the Great Vehicle.
You actualised realisation of the Great Seal.
Your great activities spread as far and wide as the sky.
To you, Great Meditator of Nyi, I pray! 1
Through the power of praying devotedly to you sublime beings,
May all those upholding the supreme practice lineage live long,
May the precious teachings flourish in all ten directions,
And may virtuous excellence fill the entire world!

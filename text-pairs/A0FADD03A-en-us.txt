The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra The Seven Buddha
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was dwelling on the summit of Kailāsa in the abode of the gods close to where the sages live
He was accompanied by a great monastic saṅgha of around five hundred monks and five hundred bodhisattvas, including the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, the bodhisattva great being Ākāśagarbha, Samantabhadra, Infinite Flowers, Samantakusuma, and others, all of whom were bodhisattvas who were just one birth away from awakening
The Blessed One saw that a monk in that alpine forest had been possessed by a spirit, had collapsed, and was lying there naked and wailing with his arms raised up
The bodhisattva great being Ākāśagarbha draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee
bowed to the Blessed One with his hands joined, and addressed him
“Blessed One, what is this great lamenting that fills the sky, and who is this naked monk raising his arms in distress?
The Blessed One told the bodhisattva great being Ākāśagarbha
“Ākāśagarbha, this monk is ill
He has contracted an illness.
The bodhisattva great being Ākāśagarbha then asked the Blessed One
“Will the Blessed One please teach a vidyāmantra that can pacify all manner of diseases and exorcise all manner of spirits?
The Blessed One emanated the seven buddhas: six tathāgatas appeared in the sky
with the seventh being the Blessed One himself, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni
The tathāgata Vipaśyin hovered in the sky above them an
spoke these root verses of the secret mantra in order to benefit all beings, pacify all manner of illnesses, and exorcise all manner of spirits
namo buddhāya | namo dharmāya | namaḥ saṅghāya | tadyathā | oṃ hala hala | hili hilāya | namo jaga | namaśca nāya | namo namaḥ svāhā 
The tathāgata Vipaśyin addressed the bodhisattva great being Ākāśagarbha, saying
“Ākāśagarbha, whoever bears this vidyāmantra in mind, recites it, or masters it will not be slain by a weapon
nor will they die from drowning, fire, or a painful illness
They will not suffer an unnatural death
Even poison they have eaten will become like food
“If you recite the vidyāmantra seven times over your food and drink before consuming it, no one else can harm you
you will not contract any illnesses, an
you will live for a long time
understand what you have studied, an
have a vision of the seven tathāgatas
“Recite this vidyāmantra in the ear of someone who has been wounded with a weapon and anoint them with jasmine oil incanted with the vidyāmantra
If you anoint those who are afflicted with diseases such as leprosy or tumors with incanted oil that contains a mixture of jasmine, blue lotus, dill, and wild asparagus, they will recover from all their illnesses
This mantra can be used for all rites.
Then the tathāgata Śikhin hovered in the sky above them an
spoke these root verses of the secret mantra in order to benefit all beings, pacify all manner of illnesses, and exorcise all manner of spirits
namo buddhāya | namo dharmāya | namaḥ saṅghāya | oṃ paca paca pācaya pācaya sarva­bhūtānām | chindaya kīlaya paravidyānāṃ svāhā 
“Ākāśagarbha, I and millions of Buddhas have taught this secret mantra in order to benefit all beings, to completely pacify all manner of illnesses, to ward off spirits that harm one’s meditation and cause nightmares, and to prevent untimely death
Now you must uphold it
“Ākāśagarbha, if someone focuses on my heart mantra three times a day, they will not be harmed by others
they will meet the Tathāgata in their dreams, an
they will not suffer a horrible death
When they die, they will meet with the tathāgatas and serve them
“You can also use the rite to bind the patient with a protection cord against all manner of illnesses
In cases where an illness is the result of a humoral imbalance, you can incant jasmine oil with the mantra and give it to the patient
You can perform the rite of sealing off the directions with water incanted with the mantra, an

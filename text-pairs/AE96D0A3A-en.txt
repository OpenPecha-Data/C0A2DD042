Brief Light Offering Prayer
In all the infinite realms throughout the far reaches of the universe,
May the precious Three Jewels together with their representations,
Be present as a supreme field for the accumulation of meritâ€”
Before you all, in your very presence,
I make this offering of a lamp of brilliant light:
Through this, for me and all other beings, infinite in number,
May the darkness of ignorance and delusion be banished entirely,
So that we may behold the light of omniscient wisdom!

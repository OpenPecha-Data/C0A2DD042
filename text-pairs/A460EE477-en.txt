Offering to the Nāgas of Gangtok
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ | oṃ āḥ hūṃ
All impurities in the offering tormas are eliminated,
And they become an inexhaustible supply of whatever each one desires.
Kyai. In the depths of the great ocean
In the immense and delightful palace
Is Śaṅkhapāla, king of the nāgas,
White in colour and blazing with light rays,
His upper body adorned with divine fabric and jewels,
His lower body has the tail of a serpent,
And his two hands hold a gleaming jewel.
He is adorned by the hoods of seven serpents.
To his left is Crest of Blazing Light, bluish green in colour,
With the same dress as her male counterpart and holding a treasure vase.
They are surrounded by a retinue of nāga and nyen earth lords.
Come now, take your place in this support, we pray.
We present these offerings to delight you:
Nāga medicine, the twenty-one nāga riches,
Splendid gifts and various forms of donation,
The whites, the sweets, milk, water and other sensory delights,
Fine silk, jewels, excellent trees,
Bathing pools, pleasure gardens and the like—
Offerings of every form of sensory stimulant.
And especially, wish-granting jewels
Created through the power of mantra and meditation.
All this we offer as a support for the arising of all that is desirable.
We confess whatever we and those around us
Have done in error and as misdeeds
That might have caused offence or upset.
May the king of mighty, bliss-gone nāgas
Always offer shelter and protection,
Pacify all sickness and causes of harm.
In accordance with the words of Padmākara,
May you guard the environment and inhabitants of this hidden land,
Bring peace, good fortune, happiness and wellbeing
And cause wealth and resources to increase.
May the teachings flourish and holders and patrons of the teachings
Enjoy ever greater virtue, excellence and glory.

Sādhana of Sitātapatrā
From natural luminosity, the state of great emptiness,
Instantaneously perfected through mere recollection, appears the Great Dispeller,
White and radiant, with two hands—one in the gesture of supreme generosity and the other holding a white umbrella.
Garbed in all the silken and jewelled adornments,
She sits in the crossed-legged vajra posture with Vairocana as her crown ornament,
And in an expanse of flames, sends out clouds of emissaries.
She is empowered by the buddhas, honoured by hosts of bodhisattvas,
And worshipped by all the guardians of the world.
At her heart, upon a moon-disc is a syllable Oṃ surrounded by the mantra garland,
Which sends out light that accomplishes the twofold benefit, and, in particular,
Carries out the activities of protecting, averting and pacifying
All illness, malevolent spirits, curses, fears, harm and dangers.

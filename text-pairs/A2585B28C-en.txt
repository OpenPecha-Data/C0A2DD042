Beautiful Garland of Flowers A Brief Prayer to the Successive Incarnations of Dzogchenpa Changchub Dorje 1
Namo śrī-gurave!
The essence of the sugatas, the all-creating sovereign,
Pervades the whole of existence and peace, and therefore
Beings of the six classes are not other than Samantabhadra.
Thus, realizing the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pay homage.
Ema!
Bodhicitta is and always has been utterly pure—
Unburnt by the fires of hell, undiminished among pretas,
Undimmed among animals, unconstrained by demons.
To this union of emptiness and compassion, I pray.
Therefrom, you manifested as the illusory yogi
Of a bygone aeon, Lungten Dorje,
And took various forms throughout the three-kāya realms;
You who were the brahmin Pal Rabden during the second age
And the Tibetan lord, King Tori Nyenshel, to you I pray.
You who were Murub Tsepo, son of Tri Songdetsen,
Yogi of the Great Compassionate One, Samtenpa,
Mantra-holder of upper Dakpo, Dorje Rabten,
As well as Buddhadvīpa 2 —to you I pray.
You who were a great hero of the nāgas in Tsarong’s lake,
And the same region’s Pönla Nyingpo Nangdzé,
Who, in the upper Do Valley, appeared as an exalted one,
Kunzang Shenpen—'Ever-Excellent Benefactor'—to you I pray. 3
Although individual forms, beyond expression, may appear tainted
By the various shades of good and bad actions,
Bodhicitta, like mercury, remains unsullied by any flaw.
To this root and branch of benefit and happiness, I pray.
Hereafter, through the play of the three samādhis,
You will appear as an emissary of the three-kāya teacher,
A forger of diverse miracles and a master of wellbeing.
To this Puntsok Jungné, 'Source of Excellence', I pray. 4
Through the force of praying in this way,
May I never be apart from the noble guru throughout successive rebirths.
May I savour the nine successive vehicles
And perfect the splendour of the five paths and ten stages.

Declaration of the Power of Truth A Prayer to Overcome Invading Forces
Through the power of the truth of the Three Jewels and the oceanic Three Roots,
Especially the vidyƒÅdhara Dorje Drakpo Tsal,
May all their power, force and strength blaze forth like apocalyptic flames
To burn away the invading forces of the Red Army until none remains.
May the machinations of these barbarians dissipate like sand in water,
And may they be naturally subdued, rendered powerless, so that the teachings of the victorious Buddha,
Together with all the ranks of those who uphold them, remain intact and unscathed.
Grant your blessings so that this aspiration may be fulfilled according to our wishes.

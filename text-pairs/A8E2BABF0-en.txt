Cloud-Banks of the Two Accumulations A Feast Offering Including The Six Vajra Lines Prayer to Be Practiced with Any Guru Sādhana
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ. Wisdom fire, wind, and water all purify grasping to appearances as real,
And the vessel and contents as the manifest ground become vajra enjoyments.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ ha hoḥ hrīḥ
Hūṃ! In the north-west of the land of Oḍḍiyāna
In the heart of a lotus flower,
Endowed with the most marvellous attainments,
You are renowned as the ‘Lotus-born’,
Surrounded by many hosts of ḍākinīs.
Following in your footsteps,
I pray to you: Come, inspire me with your blessing!
As we invite you to this gathering of pleasures,
Bestow resplendence upon this supreme place,
And transform the feast offering into wisdom amṛta!
Bestow the four empowerments upon us, supreme yogis!
Dispel all obstructers, false guides, and hindrances,
And bestow the supreme and common siddhis!
Hrīḥ. Embodiment of buddhas of past, present and future, Guru Rinpoche;
Master of all siddhis, Guru of Great Bliss;
Dispeller of all obstacles, Wrathful Subjugator of Māras;
And host of maṇḍala deities, infinite vidyādharas—
I present you with ocean-like clouds of vajra enjoyments,
A delightful offering of empty-bliss union.
May your hearts be fulfilled! I confess breaches, misdeeds, and downfalls.
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessing,
So that outer, inner and secret obstacles are dispelled
And all my aspirations are spontaneously fulfilled.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra-guru-padma siddhi hūṃ

The Offering Clouds of the Indestructible Ladies of Sound Concise Garland of Offerings of the Sixteen Vajra Goddesses
The love that unites the wisdom of emptiness and joy takes seductive form
As goddesses playing sitar, flute, clay drum and round drum,
And in their offering cloud of rigpa’s radiance, the direct realization of dharmatā,
They offer you the nirmāṇakāya-maṇḍala, in all its magical diversity:
oṃ āḥ vajra-vīṇe hūṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-vaṃśe trāṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-mṛdaṅge hrīḥ | oṃ āḥ vajra-muraje āḥ |
From extreme emptiness, supreme joy arises
As vajra goddesses beauty, laughter, song and dance,
And with their offering cloud of clear light, the increasing of experience and appearance,
They offer you the saṃbhogakāya-maṇḍala of unity:
oṃ āḥ vajra-lāsye hūṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-mālye trāṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-gīte hrīḥ | oṃ āḥ vajra-nṛtye āḥ |
Total emptiness with special joy takes shape
As goddesses of flowers, incense, lamps and fragrance,
And with their offering cloud of the space of the ground, rigpa reaching fullness,
They offer you the dharmakāya-maṇḍala, supreme in all aspects:
oṃ āḥ vajra-pūṣpe hūṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-dhupe trāṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-āloke hrīḥ | oṃ āḥ vajra-gandhe āḥ |
Supreme emptiness and coemergent wisdom appear as
The vajra goddesses of form, taste, touch and dharmadhātu,
And with their ultimate offering cloud, the exhaustion of phenomenal reality beyond the ordinary mind,
They offer you the svabhāvikakāya maṇḍala, the inseparability of all.
oṃ āḥ vajra-rūpe hūṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-rāse trāṃ | oṃ āḥ vajra-sparśe hrīḥ | oṃ āḥ vajra-dharmadhāto āḥ |

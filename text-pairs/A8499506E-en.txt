Ocean of Offering Clouds A Light Offering Prayer
This lamp, made of the finest precious metal,
Is as vast as the entire billionfold universe.
It is filled completely with refined essence of butter,
And in its centre is planted a wick as large as Mount Meru,
Set alight, to produce tongues of flame,
Which are in essence the five wisdoms,
And, in appearance, blaze with the dazzling splendour
Of a hundred million brightest suns.
This light pervades every realm in all the ten directions.
And out of its radiant expanse,
Emanate offering-clouds, like Samantabhadraâ€™s,
To make gifts throughout eternity, until the very ends of time,
So that I and all those connected to me,
The objects of my prayers, be they living or dead,
Gather the two accumulations, purify the two kinds of obscuration,
And swiftly attain unsurpassable awakening.

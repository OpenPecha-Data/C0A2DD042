Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas! Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, in the Kalanda­kanivāpa near Rājagṛha
together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks and with twelve hundred bodhisattvas, all of whom had obtained dhāraṇīs
They had unimpeded wisdom and were unhindered in their sphere of activity
They were skilled in means, had developed equanimity toward everything in the three realms
and possessed an altruistic mindset of compassion and benevolence
All of them were there to request Dharma teachings from the Thus-Gone One
The whole assembly, while circumambulating the Thus-Gone One
the bodhisattva great being Suvi­krānta­mati, and the bodhisattva great being Avaloki­teśvara
the bodhisattva great being Mahāmati, the bodhisattva great being Ananta­prati­bhān
the bodhisattva great being Aniñjya, the bodhisattva great being Sumati
the bodhisattva great being Nityodyukta, the bodhisattva great being Sama­tā­vihā­rin
the bodhisattva great being Maitreya
The twelve hundred bodhisattvas in attendance include
Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, the nāga kings
the lords of the rākṣasas, and three hundred yakṣiṇīs
There were also six thousand caraka, parivrājaka, and nirgrantha non-Buddhists, as well as the seven lords of the garuḍas
Also present wer
worshiped him by scattering a rain of celestial flowers and sandalwood powder, and playing divine cymbals and drums
With manifest faith in the teaching of the Thus-Gone One, they exclaimed
“Blessed One, excellent, excellent
Blessed One, the teaching of the Thus-Gone One that extinguishes all disturbing emotions is a great miracle
It is excellent, excellent!
“Whose power is causing this illumination of our homes
the manifestation of this great miracle, these earthquakes, and this great rain of flowers
Everyone was amazed at the sight of this great miraculous display and wondered
and divine lights and fragrances manifested everywhere
The sound of celestial cymbals resounded
The homes of the lords of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, and humans were illuminated
All the beings in this great trichiliocosm who had taken birth in the lower realms were instantly freed
At that moment the Blessed One entered the absorption known as the stainless victory banner that completely subdues all disturbing emotions
Through the power of that absorption, the earth shook violently, causing it to rise and sink. It quivered, trembled, and quaked
wobbled, rocked, and swayed; vibrated, shuddered, and reeled
convulsed, rattled, and shook; clattered, rattled, and clanged; and boomed, thundered, and roared
A rain of sandalwood powder and celestial flowers fell from the sky, and divine light shone throughout the world
and this great rain of flowers? Whose blessings are causing all of this?
Having reflected on this silently for a moment, they said to each other, “This is the power of the Thus-Gone One
These are the miracles of the Thus-Gone One!
At that time the Four Great Kings thought, “Let us go to where the Blessed One resides so we can meet
pay homage to, and worship the Thus-Gone One, and listen to the Dharma.
Then the bodhisattva Vyūharāja made offerings to the Thus-Gone One in the form of displays both mighty and divine, as well as a great rain of flowers
The bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi was surrounded by millions of bodhisattva
and millions of gods, and there were many hundreds of vidyādharas present before him
Through the great power of their supernatural abilities
with a great array of flowers, perfumes, flower garlands, incense, cymbals, and great drums
they worshiped the Thus-Gone One, his saṅgha of monks, and the gathering of bodhisattva
All the bodhisattva great beings then circumambulated the Blessed One three times and sat to one side to listen to the Dharma
Their downpour of flowers covered the wide earth up to knee height
So the lords of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and rākṣasas, all these powerful beings endowed with great supernatural powers
with them blue lotus flowers, pink lotus flowers, water lilies, and white lotus flowers, as well as jasmine, mandārava, and mahāmandārava flowers
then proceeded to the Bamboo Grove, in the Kalanda­kanivāpa where the Blessed One was residing, carryin
Once there, they worshiped the Blessed One and paid homage to him
Seeing that vast assembly, the bodhisattva great beings longed for a Dharma discourse
In his mind, the Blessed One knew the bodhisattvas’ wish, and so spoke to the bodhisattva Vyūharāja, saying
“Noble son, go and survey the wide earth.
The bodhisattva Vyūharāja surveyed the wide earth and replied
“Blessed One, I have surveyed the wide earth
Blessed One, I see the great assembly you brought about for the happiness of all beings.
“Vyūharāja,” declared the Blessed One, “on this very day the attainment of unsurpassed and perfect awakening will be prophesied for sixty-four thousand beings.
The bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi then fell at the feet of the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, many gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, humans, carakas, and parivrājakas have gathered here
Blissful One, many beings have gathered here
Blessed One, [F..b] this is the time for hearing the Dharma
Blissful One, this is the time for hearing the Dharma.
But the Blessed One remained silent
“Blessed One, I request you to teach the Dharma! Blissful One, I request you to teach the Dharma
I request you to fulfill the aspirations of all beings
So the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then supplicated the Thus-Gone One a second time, and a third time
Blessed One, I request you to dispel their remorse
For the welfare and happiness of all beings, I request you to teach the sūtra called The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities
It extinguishes all disturbing emotions
overcomes all demons, brings an end to all evil deeds
generates faith in those who lack faith, quells the torments caused by famines
cures all sicknesses, and wards off untimely death
The very moment I heard it from the Thus-Gone One Vidyuprabhāsa
all phenomena became immediately apparent to me, the gates to the lower realms closed completely
and all karmic obscurations were eliminated. Please teach this sūtra!
But in response, the Blessed One told the bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi
“Noble son, in the future there will be beings who have no faith in my teaching
who have no genuine faith or trust in the sūtras spoken by the Thus-Gone One
They will claim, ‘This is not a sūtra taught by the Thus-Gone One,
or, ‘According to this teaching there is no karmic maturation of either good or bad actions.
Overwhelmed by greed, they will not engage in activities of worship, not even toward those who teach the Dharma
They will experience many misfortunes in that very life and will burn in the hell realms in their future rebirths
Noble son, [F..a] this is not the time to hear this great king of sūtras that is like the father and mother of the thus-gone ones and that exhausts all karma
Moreover, it might cause those non-Buddhist carakas and parivrājakas
as well as many other beings, to be reborn in the lower realms
Noble son, they will not have faith in this king of sūtras
With their minds blinded by desire, they will be preoccupied with their households
They will engage in farm work and business, fight battles, and crave conflict
After they die, they will burn in the eight great hells.
At that moment, however, eighty thousand beings stood up, fell at the feet of the Blessed One, and said
“Blessed One, we will have faith in this sūtra
We will revere it and spread it
We will be eager to write it down, read it aloud, propagate it, and recite it
Later on, when the Dharma has disappeared, we will bear criticism, intimidation, and abuse
Blessed One, we will remember your kindness, and will not be ungrateful or have regrets later
Blessed One, please teach the sūtra called The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities
In future times, this sūtra will perform the activity of the Thus-Gone One.
The bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then asked
“Blessed One, how should a bodhisattva great being search for a spiritual friend?
“Noble son,” answered the Blessed One, “a bodhisattva great bein
who searches for a spiritual friend should possess these four qualities
 a wish to be continuously in the presence of a spiritual friend,  a diligent nature
 a completely pure motivation, and  the wish to receive the Dharma.
“Blessed One,” continued the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, “how should a bodhisattva live in solitude?
The Blessed One replied
“That bodhisattva should avoid the householder life, avoid associating with non-spiritual friends, and give up all personal possessions.
The bodhisattva great being noble Avaloki­teśvara then said
“Blessed One, I have never seen anyone reborn in the lower realms after hearing this Dharma teaching
In fact, that would be impossible
Blessed One, just listening to this Dharma teaching and paying homage to it is already a great miracle and a great wonder
not to mention the acts of writing this Dharma teaching down; commissioning it to be written; holding it; reading it aloud
venerating it with parasols, victory banners, and flags
or of offering clothes and ornaments to those who teach it
Such people are blessed by all the buddhas
The thus-gone ones have prophesied that they will be reborn in Sukhāvatī
Such Dharma teachers should be regarded as thus-gone ones themselves.
“Excellent, excellent,” said the Blessed One. “Thus it is, noble son
I too will revere those who spread this Dharma teaching
And I prophesy that they will be reborn in Sukhāvatī
Those who revere the thus-gone ones and worship them with flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands
ointments, cloths, ornaments, parasols, victory banners, and flags will not die an untimely death
They will not fear enemy armies or the calamity of famines
They will not be distressed over their children or their spouses
and all their aspirations will be completely fulfilled
Noble son, it is rare for thus-gone ones to appear and for this king of sūtras to be heard
Noble son, whether in a village, a city, a market, a house
or an isolated place, any place in which this Dharma teaching is heard will be kept under the care of the thus-gone ones.
“Blessed One,” asked the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi
“Because he sees and surveys the entire world; brings contentment, protection, and relief
has a compassionate, benevolent, loving, and affectionate mind
and completely fulfills all aspirations, he is named ‘Avaloki­teśvara.’ 
“why did Avaloki­teśvara receive the name ‘Avaloki­teśvara (The Lord Who Sees)’?
The bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then said
“Blessed One, just to contemplate Avaloki­teśvara’s name completely fulfills all one’s aspirations
not to mention worshiping the Thus-Gone One, or having faith in this Dharma teaching
holding it, reading it aloud, writing it down, commissioning it to be written
worshiping it with great offerings of clothes and ornaments, and adorning it with ornaments!
At that point, the bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara exclaimed
“Blessed One, this Dharma teaching has great power
It performs the Thus-Gone One’s activity!
“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One
“I have a dhāraṇī called jayamatī that I received from the Thus-Gone One Jayaghoṣa when I was a bodhisattva
As soon as I obtained it, I reached the tenth level and many thousands of beings reached the level where they become receptive to the unborn nature of phenomena.
“Blessed One, please teach us that powerful dhāraṇī!” pleaded the bodhisattvsas
The Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, then uttered this dhāraṇī with the sound and intonation of a kalaviṅka bird
tadyathā: jaya jaya, jayavaha, khavaha, jayavaha, hulu hulu, padmābhe, avam ava me
sara saraṇe, dhiri dhiri, dhiri dhiri, devatānupālani, yuddha uttāraṇi, para­cakra­nivāraṇi
pūraya bhagavān sarvāśān, mama sarva­karma kṣapaya, buddhādhiṣṭhānena, svāhā
“Noble son, this is the dhāraṇī called jayamatī. It exhausts all evil deeds
increases wealth, multiplies crops, repels enemy armies, quells the torments caused by famines, and prolongs life
This Dharma teaching is like the father and mother of all thus-gone ones
who worships it with a pure motivation, writes it down, commissions it to be written
and venerates those who teach it with great offerings, will eradicate all their karmic obscurations
Noble son, a person who pays homage to this Dharma teaching and the words of this dhāraṇī mantra
They will not die an untimely death and will experience happiness in this life
They will feel content with their children, spouse, household
or kingdom, and all their aspirations will be fulfilled.
“Blessed One,” said the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi
“I pay homage to this Dharma teaching
I will also worship those who teach it, write it down, hold it, and read it aloud
Those who worship this Dharma teaching and make offerings of clothes, ornaments, parasols, and carriage
and carriages to the ones who teach it are thereby worshiping all the thus-gone ones
Blessed One, to those who worship me and all the bodhisattvas with the highest offerings
I will grant protection in every kingdom, I will fulfill all their aspirations
and I will make them venerable in every kingdom
Blessed One, I will also bestow the words of a dhāraṇī mantra for the sake of those who listen to the Dharma
I will fulfill all their aspirations. I will care for them.
“Noble son, speak for the sake of beings!” urged the Blessed One
The bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then uttered the words of this dhāraṇī mantra
namaḥ sarva­tathāgatānāṃ, namo ´mitābhāya tathāgatāya
namaḥ sarva­buddha­bodhi­sattvānāṃ, namaḥ sarva­mahārdhikebhyas
tadyathā: huhu hehe, mati mati, mahā­mati, vajra­mati, dṛḍha­vajra­mati
tathāgatānu­paripālite, sara sara, ayomukhi bhṛkuṭi, bhṛkuṭa­mukhi, kṛpe kṛpāluke

sarvāśāṃ pari­pūraya, dehi me varam buddha­satyena bodhi­sattva­satyena, svāhā
“Venerable Blessed One, those who want to reach the level of a bodhisattva, have a vision of a thus-gone one
be reborn in a buddha realm, or gain sovereignty, possessions, lands
wealth, or crops should worship this Dharma teaching and those who teach it with vast offerings
ointments, bedding, cushions, clothes, ornaments, parasols, and carriages
They should also worshi
those who write it down, hold it, and read it aloud, with gifts of perfumes, flower garlands
Blessed One, I will protect them and make them highly venerable in every kingdom
I will provide them with all the happiness they wish for
and I will look after each of them as if they were my only child
“Those who wish to have a vision of me, become a powerful monarch, attain the state of meditative absorption
have the ability to retain what they hear, transmute minerals, become invisible, and fly through the sky
should fast for an entire day and night on the eighth day of the waxing moon
They should then make an image of Vajradhara in the color of a reed. It should be adorned with every ornament
have a peaceful appearance, and be filled with relics
The Thus-Gone One, Śākyamuni, should be placed at the cente
and the noble four-armed Avaloki­teśvara to the right
The latter should also be adorned with every ornament and filled with relics
The Four Great Kings should be present on the left and right sides, in postures of worship
“Those of noble family who engage in this practice must maintain ritual purity, make ablutions, and change their clothes three times a day
They should cultivate a loving attitude toward all beings
From the eighth day of the waxing moon until the full moon of the following month
they must only eat rice porridge and barley, recite the mantra three times a day
and offer incense consisting of aloeswood, sandalwood, frankincense, and myrrh
They should recite this mantra , times. This is known as the preparatory recitation
“At a shrine containing relics, or at a hermitage
they should perform worship with various types of incense, perfumes, flowers, and flags
and should offer divine food made of white flour
They should also commission this Dharma teaching to be written, and worship it with various clothes, ornaments, scarves, parasols, and carriages
Until the date of the full moon, they must keep a compassionate attitude toward all beings
as well as bathe and change clothes three times a day
They should create a square maṇḍala of smeared cow dung, cover it with different kinds of flowers
and arrange sixteen filled vases and sixteen lamps
The space should be adorned with various parasols, victory banners, and flags
Having offered various kinds of delicious divine foods and sprinkled the area with scented water
they should recite the mantra until the image and the ground start to shake, and until they experience a state of joy
They should then know that the practice has definitely succeeded
Afterward I will manifest in their dreams and instruct them
I will fulfill all their aspirations and look after each of them as if they were my only child
I will grant them any boon that they desire, except if they lose faith and abandon this Dharma teaching.
“Vajrapāṇi,” declared the Blessed One, “what you have said is excellent, excellent!
The bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara then said to the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi
“Noble son, this Dharma teaching will not spread among beings of inferior merit
They will not be able to write it down, commission it to be written, hold it, or read it aloud
Māra will create obstacles for them
Noble son, [F..b] there are four deeds of Māra that create obstacles to the endeavors of writing this Dharma teaching down, reading it aloud, and propagating it
These four are:  laziness,  lack of faith,  lack of reverence for the master, and  a wandering mind when teaching the Dharma
“There are four other deeds of Māra. These four are
Noble son, you should understand these four to be deeds of Māra
 taking no interest in a spiritual friend,  not reflecting deeply,  harshness in words
and  being caught up in worldly concerns and thinking such things as, ‘I am not afraid of this life or of future ones,
‘There is no karmic maturation of unwholesome actions,’ ‘No words are unclear to me,
 craving for wealth, which causes suffering for many eons
and will experience suffering for many eons. These four deeds of Māra should be regarded as non-virtuous friends
 joking and gossiping with non-virtuous spiritual friends
 being content with one’s spouse; and  undermining the interest of those who study the Dharma
that is, going to a place where influential people gather and proclaiming, ‘Generosity produces no karmic result
But you are a religious person who has practiced a lot of Dharma
This Dharma teacher is an evildoer! Intoxicated by the arrogance of his powerful status, he indulges in sexual misconduc
and delights in divisive speech. He wants to create obstacles to your life
You read aloud the sūtras and commission them to be written.
Such people prevent this sūtra from being written down and venerated
Such people prevent this sūtra from being written down and venerated
They will encounter many obstacles in this very life and burn in hell in their future rebirths
Noble son, you must understand that these are deeds of Māra, and you must not fall under their influence.
“My friends,” said the Blessed One, “I say this repeatedly
be heedful, or later, when you are burning in the hell realms, you will have regrets.
The Blessed One then uttered these verses
“I have taught many kings of sūtras. I have established many beings in the state of awakening
I have taught the way of the buddhas. When you hear this, be heedful
“When dark, horrible times come, It is possible to fall into bad states
Those who have unwavering faith in this sūtra Are truly my own children
“Those who continuously worship this sūtra Will be reborn in the buddha realms
Wherever this king of sūtras is found, No one is harmed by bhūtas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, “Pretas, kumbhāṇḍas, mahoragas, Kṛtyās, or kākhordas
All their aspirations will be completely fulfilled, And they will easily awaken to buddhahood.
When they heard these verses, the Four Great Kings shed tears, moved by the power of the Dharma
Trembling, they fell at the feet of the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, we four great kings will worship those who spread this Dharma teaching and protect those who listen to it
Blessed One, we will protect those who write it down and commission it to be written
We will also protect those who hold, read aloud, and master the dhāraṇīs
as well as those who worship such Dharma teachers with clothes and ornaments
as well as those who worship such Dharma teachers with clothes and ornaments
We will protect their lands. We will grant them all the wealth and crops they desire
We will look after each of them as if they were our only child. [F..b] We will fight in front of them in every battle
We will win for them the highest respect in every kingdom
We will remember the kindness of the thus-gone ones; we will not be ungrateful
Blessed One, we will cause despair in anyone who hears this Dharma teaching but does not revere it, and who fails to worship those who teach it.
In response, the Blessed One expressed his approval to the Four Great Kings, saying, “Excellent, excellent, great kings
Great kings, always act in this excellent way!
Then the great king of the gandharvas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, fell at the feet of the Blessed One and said
“Blessed One, in the future there will be beings who indulge in non-virtue
who have no faith in the thus-gone ones and lack insight
They will not memorize such Dharma teachings, nor read them aloud
nor commission them to be written. They will not practice generosity
nor will they believe in the karmic maturation of generosity. They will only be concerned with the happiness of this life
This great king of sūtras, which is equal to the Thus-Gone One, is taught for the sake of beings like these.
“Noble son,” said the Blessed One, “two factors cause beings to fall into the hell realms
These two are:  attachment and  anger. Noble son, these two factors cause beings to fall into the hell realms
Noble son, four factors cause beings to be reborn among the favorable states of existence
The Blessed One then uttered these verses
These four are:  regarding all beings equally,  purity of motivation
 relinquishing all possessions, and  the practice of celibacy.
“Great king! This generosity is a great miracle! It liberates from the miserable fates of the lower realms
Deluded beings, continuously bound by sense pleasures, Are intoxicated by many hundred kinds of greed
“They do not have faith in this sūtra, Nor are they generous toward the Buddha’s teaching
Such beings will be reborn in the lower realms And there experience suffering. “To benefit such beings
I have taught this powerful sūtra. To a king with unwavering faith in it
No kṛtyā or evildoer, “No bhūta, kumbhāṇḍa, or mahoraga Can cause any harm
The merit of writing down this sūtra correctly, Of hearing it, venerating it, and upholding it
“Is praised by the buddhas through their wisdom, And cannot be expressed by beings, Even if they tried for many eons
The merit generated by those who continuously honor “And worship the buddhas and the bodhisattva
Of the merit of those who write down Even just a single letter of this sūtra.
Does not match even a hundred-thousandth portio
The bodhisattva great being, noble Avaloki­teśvara, then said
“Blessed One, noble sons and daughters who have faith in this Dharm
will generate many excellent qualities and benefits in this very life
They will not be harmed by eye, ear, nose, or tongue diseases, nor by fevers, poisons, weapons, or fire
They will live happily with their parents, children, spouses, and families
and will be victorious in every battle
“Excellent, excellent, Blessed One!” continued the bodhisattva great being noble Avaloki­teśvara
“It is excellent that this teaching has been established in this world by the Thus-Gone One and that it performs his awakened activity
Blessed One, this great knowledge completely purifies all karma.
“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “this teaching will not spread among beings of inferior merit
Those beings will not hear this teaching. It will not come into their hands
When, through the power of the Buddha, this teaching comes into someone’s hands
or when the thus-gone ones cause someone to hear it, that person should immediately write it down
commission it to be written, and read it aloud
Great being, you glow with the roots of virtue! You will be reborn wherever you wish.’ 
When they die, the thus-gone one Akṣobhya will bring them relief, saying, ‘Come. Enter the realm of Sukhāvatī
and who worship with great offerings those who teach it, write it down, and memorize it
worship it with flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, ointments, parasols, victory banners, and flags
Noble son, after merely hearing the name of this Dharma teaching that is equal to the Thus-Gone One
one will not have to fear the lower realms
Someone who propagates just a single letter or a single word from this Dharma teaching
or transmits it in some land or country, should be regarded as equal to the Thus-Gone One
should be worshiped as a thus-gone one, and should be regarded as one’s own parent
Noble son, this Dharma teaching has been taught by the seven thus-gone ones
has been rejoiced in by all the bodhisattvas, and has been upheld and protected by all the gods
This Dharma teaching is like the father and mother of all bodhisattvas.
The bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then asked
“Blessed One, in the future, where will this Dharma teaching continue to spread in its complete form?
“Noble son,” said the Blessed One, “this Dharma teaching will spread and remain in its complete form in the oceanic abode of the king of the nāgas
and in the abode of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
It will spread to the southern region
In this world it will remain only for a while. Here, it will spread to some places but not to others.
“Vajrapāṇi,” continued the Blessed One
“I entrust this Dharma teaching to you. Memorize it, read it aloud, venerate it, and disseminate it
Do not let this Dharma teaching that is equal to the Thus-Gone One vanish, for it performs the activity of a thus-gone one.
for it performs the activity of a thus-gone one.
“Blessed One, I will take up this Dharma teaching,” replied the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi
“I will memorize it, read it aloud, venerate it, and disseminate it
I will venerate and honor those who teach it
Those who worship its teachers also worship me, so I will protect them and look after them
I will remember the kindness of the Thus-Gone One.
The Blessed One expressed his approval to the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, saying, “Excellent, excellent, Vajrapāṇi
Act in that way!” The bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, I pay homage to this Dharma teaching
I too will worship those who listen to it, write it down, read it aloud, memorize it, [F..b] and disseminate it
Blessed One, if this Dharma teaching should spread among beings of inferior meri
or where an immoral king rules, that king will not worship this Dharma teaching
He will not have faith in it
He also will not worship those who teach it, write it down, read it aloud, memorize it, disseminate it, or transmit it
He will not perceive them as his master. For these reasons, this Dharma teaching will vanish
Tremendous harm will unfold and a lot of unhappiness will be experienced in such a place
Therefore the ruling class and the king should realize, ‘The Dharma has vanished from our realm,
and then take up the practice of the Dharma.” “Excellent, excellent,” replied the Blessed One
“Thus it is, noble son! Noble son, as an analogy, consider a faithful noble son or daughter who
for a hundred or even a thousand years, worships with unsurpassed offerings as many thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River
Suppose that person also makes offerings to the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas by filling up this world with precious jewels and offering it to them
and also gives away their own body, spouse, sons, and daughters as offerings
By comparison, however, a person creates much more meri
by worshiping this Dharma teaching, writing it down, reading it aloud, commissioning it to be written, worshipin
it with flowers, incense, perfumes, and flower garlands, or by offering even just a single karṣāpaṇa to it
“If someone, perceiving this teaching as their master, worships it with parasols, victory banners, [F..a] and flags, o
The roots of virtue generated in the former cases do not match even one percent of the merit generated by venerating this sutra
understands that their body is insubstantial like a dream, an illusion
or a water bubble—that this body is insubstantial and all phenomena are impermanent
requests this Dharma teaching by offering clothes, ornaments, parasols, carriages, villages, cities, or even a piece of land the size of an ox’s hoof print to those who teach it, and, having been instructed in this Dharma teaching
then they have been prophesied and inspired by the thus-gone ones
then they have been prophesied and inspired by the thus-gone ones
and will worship all the thus-gone ones until eventually they awaken to unsurpassed, perfect buddhahood.
At that moment all the bodhisattvas, the lords of the gods, the lords of the nāgas, the lords of the yakṣas, the lords of the rākṣasas
the lords of the garuḍas, and the lords of the kinnaras expressed in unison their approval to the Blessed One
“Excellent, excellent, Blessed One! This was a second turning of the wheel of Dharma
Blessed One, we will all act in accordance with this Dharma teaching and worship it
We will also protect that land. We will worship those who teach it, and will protect them, appear to them, and inspire them
Whoever perceives the teachers of this Dharma, or those who write it down, memorize it
and read it aloud, as their own master, parent, or child, we too will regard them as our own parents
Anywhere this Dharma teaching becomes corrupted there will be strife among children, spouses, and parents
and all will be reborn in the hells.
May this Dharma teaching that is equal to the Thus-Gone One not rapidly vanish
My friends, please do exactly that
I entrust this Dharma teaching to you so that you may propagate and worship it
and may no one discard it and fall into the hell realms
“Excellent, excellent, noble sons
The Blessed One expressed his approval to the bodhisattvas and to everyone else, [F..b] from the lords of the gods to the lords of the humans, saying
This Dharma teaching will bring benefit and happiness to many beings
Have no regrets!” When this Dharma teaching was taught, this world wobbled and rocked
The minds of six thousand beings were liberated from their defilements with no further grasping
The bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara then asked
“Blessed One, if someone writes this Dharma teaching down, commissions it to be written, memorizes it
“Excellent, excellent, noble son
The Blessed One expressed his approval to the bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara, saying
It is excellent that you ask the Thus-Gone One about this matter
Noble son, listen carefully and keep in mind what I will explain to you now
how much merit will that noble son or daughter generate? Where will they be reborn?
reads it aloud, masters it, teaches it extensivel
and genuinely, and worships it with flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, parasols, victory banners, and flags
If a noble son or daughter writes this Dharma teaching down, commissions it to be written, memorizes it
and genuinely, and worships it with flowers, incense, [F..a] perfumes, flower garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, parasols, victory banners, and flags
when they die they will be reborn in Sukhāvatī
Therefore, [F..b] all noble sons and daughters should respectfully listen to it and keep it in mind
Those who teach it are also worthy of reverence and worship
“this Dharma teaching is to be revered by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras
Blessed One, this Dharma teaching is a great miracle
“Blessed One,” said the bodhisattva great being noble Avaloki­teśvara
One should regard a noble one who spreads this teaching as a thus-gone one and perform worship exactly as one would for a thus-gone one.
“Noble son, compared to making offerings to all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas by filling up this great trichiliocosm with precious jewels
Noble son, the merit generated is not at all comparable
“Noble son, a noble son or daughter who engages in bodhisattva conduc
will give away their own sons, daughters, spouse, arms, legs, eyes, and head as offerings
reads it aloud, and inspires faith in it will generate much more merit
Compared to them, someone who writes this Dharma teaching down, commissions it to be written
Noble son, the merit is not at all comparable
who upholds this Dharma teaching, worships it, writes it down, commissions it to be written
and worships those who teach it with offerings such as flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, and ointments will be much greater
the merit generated by a noble son or daughte
Such a place should be revered by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras.
“Thus it is, thus it is, noble son!” replied the Blessed One
The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva great being noble Avaloki­teśvara
All their aspirations will be completely fulfilled.
They will be reborn in the pure buddha realms, will not die a horrible death, and will not be reborn in the lower realms
They will be reborn in wealthy families for ninety thousand eons and as a universal monarch for eighty thousand eons
“Noble son, in the past, countless eons ago
appeared the thus-gone one called Dharma­jñānāsaṅga­viraja­ketu­rāja
At that time I had taken birth as a brahmin and heard this Dharma teaching, which I then taught to others
“Noble son, that place is indeed to be revered by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras.
“Blessed One,” said the bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara
“if someone worships this Dharma teaching and makes an offering to it of a single mustard seed, with a mind inspired by veneration and respect
all the karma they have generated by engaging in the five acts with immediate retribution will be completely exhausted
Therefore, [F..b] all noble sons and daughters should respectfully listen to it and keep it in mind
Blessed One, wherever this Dharma teaching spreads, that place will be blessed by the Thus-Gone On
and should be regarded as a place of worship
As soon as I received this teaching, I became receptive to the unborn nature of phenomena and purified my spiritual insight into phenomena
All those who heard this teaching were freed from the lower realm
and would never again fall back into such states of existence
Their spiritual insight into phenomena was purified
All those beings will eventually awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood
“Noble son, for many years, for many hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of years
I gave away my wealth, grains, cowries, and gold to help those who were bound by attachment, anger, and ignorance
heard this Dharma teaching, which I then taught to others
Eventually, I gave away my arms, legs, eyes, and head, as well as my beloved sons, spouses, and daughters
I gave away my marrow and my bones, my homes, my villages, my towns, my cities, my countries, and my royal palaces
For hundreds of thousands of years I observed celibacy, stayed away from households, and never enjoyed kingdoms
wealth, countries, palaces, retinues, sons, daughters, or spouses
I was entirely celibate, and only performed acts of generosity
I focused only on worshiping and serving the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha
I continuously honored, respected, worshiped, and venerated those who taught the Dharma
offering them flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, parasols, victory banners, and flags
I served many spiritual friends, and with weariness toward saṃsāra
offered my own body, eyes, flesh, [F..b] marrow, bones, and skin—not to mention all the outer material things
without ever feeling any regret.
When they heard about the past deeds of the Thus-Gone One
the bodhisattvas, the lords of the gods, the lords of the nāgas, the lords of the yakṣas
moved by the power of the Dharma, and became receptive to the unborn nature of phenomena
It performs the activity of the Thus-Gone One for the sake of beings.
“My friends,” continued the Blessed One, “uphold this Dharma teaching
The bodhisattva noble Avaloki­teśvara then said
“Blessed One, rare are the beings who have faith in this Dharma teaching, worship it, memorize it, read it aloud, and master it
Anyone who upholds this teaching should be regarded as a buddha appearing in the world.
“Excellent, excellent, noble son!” replied the Blessed One. “Thus it is, noble son
the lords of the asuras, the lords of humans, the carakas, the parivrājakas, and the nirgranthas all shed tears
Rare are the noble sons or daughters who worship this Dharma teaching
write it down, commission it to be written, memorize it, read it
and worship those who teach it with flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands
ointments, powders, clothes, parasols, victory banners, and flags
flower garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, parasols, victory banners, and flags
Rare are the noble sons or daughters who worshi
They themselves should be regarded as thus-gone ones
“Noble son, there will be beings who do not worship this Dharma teaching, who do not memorize it
read it aloud, or make offerings to it
They will circle in saṃsāra for many eons, for a hundred or a thousand eons
They will experience much suffering, hundreds of types of suffering
As an analogy, consider a pregnant woman
When her baby boy or girl is forming in her womb during the different stages of the pregnancy
from the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth month all the way until the birth of the child
the mother’s body is taken over by the baby
Her joints are pushed apart, she loses her appetite, and her voice becomes weak
She carries the baby while experiencing the pain of these oppressive physical sensations
Until the baby is born, she experiences the suffering of the hell beings
and thinks, ‘After I give birth to my child, if everything goes well, I will become celibate forever!
Later, however, excited by desire for sensual pleasures, she will forget all that suffering
and only think of pleasure
“Similarly, in the future there will be beings who have no faith in this Dharma teaching
who will not worship it, memorize it, or read it aloud
They will be reborn among the hell realms, the animal realms, or in the world of the Lord of Death
‘I have to look after my household, my family, my spouse, my sons, and my daughters.
When they are reborn in the hell realms, they will feel regret
and will neither engage in generosity nor maintain their discipline
Afterward, however, once liberated from those hellish states, they will be excited by desire and forget the suffering they endured in the hell realms
“Consider also the analogy of someone intoxicated by liquor
When someone is strongly intoxicated, to the point of being completely drunk
They do not think about their parents, spouse, sons, or daughters
they are unable to find their way home, or to their bed
They do not remember the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha
Intoxicated like this, they become fearless. Even if they pass by a charnel ground, they think
‘What god, nāga, or yakṣa can frighten me!
They perceive mats made of dirt, wood, grass, or thorns as comfortable beds
deluded by their householder lives and intoxicated by wealth, do not seek out the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgh
These beings will circle in saṃsāra
experiencing the suffering of being reborn among the hell realms, the animal realms, or in the World of the Lord of Death
They do not remember to be generous
They do not strive to be reborn among the higher realms, as a king, or in the buddha realms
Later, however, when they recover and awaken from their drunkenness and regain their senses, they feel remorse about their conduc
and think, ‘Even at the cost of my life, I will never drink liquor again!’ 
“Similarly, beings whose minds are inebriated by desire and conceit
They think, ‘I’m healthy; I’m not suffering.
However, when these beings are liberated from the hell realms
the animal realms, and the World of the Lord of Deat
and experience the suffering of the hell realms all over again
Therefore, never act carelessly!
At that point venerable Ānanda asked
“Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teaching? How should we remember it?
“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One
“remember this Dharma teaching as The Protector of All Beings
The Questions of the Bodhisattvas, The King of the Miraculous Display of the King of the Array
In spite of this, once they are liberated from the womb, they nevertheless continue to act carelessl
they think, ‘I have circled in saṃsāra for a hundred years, an eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons
a hundred thousand eons. I have experienced all these unbearable, horrible, painful sensations
I wonder what previous actions caused all these awful situations
It must be due to my many evil deeds in the past
Even being in the womb produces similar regrets as those produced by the experience in the hells
So they promise themselves, ‘Once I am liberated from this hell-like womb
I will seek out the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha with undivided faith
I will by all means avoid this hell-like experience of the womb!
and take rebirth in a human body that is so difficult to obtain, their body becomes weary from the physical torment
and the darkness endured while in the womb
Weary of soaking in blood and bile, phlegm, excrement, and filth
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra entitled The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities
This was translated, edited and finalized by the Indian paṇḍitas Prajñāvarman and Surendrabodhi
the translator-editor the venerable Yeshé Dé, and others
The Complete Awakening of the Thus-Gone Ones
and The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities.
When the Blessed One finished speaking
the bodhisattvas, the great śrāvakas, Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, and all their retinues
as well as the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, all rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One
‘My mind is not dull,’ ‘I am handsome,’ and ‘I am powerful.

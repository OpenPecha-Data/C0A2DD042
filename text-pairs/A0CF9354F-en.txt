Three Prayers from the Earth Pig Year
Infinite blessed deities, peaceful and wrathful, turn your attention towards me, I pray!
Since we are connected through your great wisdom and compassion,
May all the impairments and breakages of samaya that I and others have committed
Be purified through the power of your great sacred pledge.
Ho! Youthful Mañjuśrī, the body of self-arisen original wisdom,
Dwelling inseparably within my heart—through radiating rays of light,
Cause all the darkness of deluded perception within saṃsāra
To be cleared away in the basic space of equality and great bliss.
Ho!  Vidyādhara gurus of the three lineages with your compassion,
Infinite peaceful and wrathful yidam deities with your blessings,
Ḍākas and ḍākinīs of the three places with your power and strength,
Protectors, dharmapālas and guardian deities with your scared pledges,
All of you, please turn your attention towards me, I pray!
With a mind that is tormented by weariness and sorrow, I beg you:
Do not forget your sacred pledge, but gaze upon me at once with your compassion,
Grant me your blessings, and bestow the supreme and ordinary accomplishments!

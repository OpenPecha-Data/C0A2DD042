Verses of Aspiration for the Swift Return of Tsikey Chokling Mingyur Dewey Dorjé
Supreme and peerless guide, son of Śuddhodana; 1
Eminent Abbot, Master and Dharma King, protectors of beings of the Snowy Land;
And each of the boundless gatherings of the sources of refuge—
Bestow auspiciousness, we pray, that this aspiration be fulfilled this very day!
Through the strength of unchanging ( mingyur ) supreme intentions and noble aspirations,
May the re-emanation of Dewey Dorjé—
Who makes the precious teachings flourish in all directions,
And who earnestly upholds the sacred disciplines of study and practice—bloom again!

Prayer for the Long Life of Khandro Tāre Lhamo
Emaho!
Khecarī, single mother of the victorious buddhas of the three kāyas,
Appearing in female human form for the sake of beings in this realm,
A friend who opens the door onto untold benefit and happiness—
Tāre Devī, at your feet I pray!
Coarse body matured into the perfection of the indestructible subtle essence,
Turbulent karmic winds drawn into the womb-like sanctuary of the avadhūti ,
And agitated thoughts and conceptions matured into dharmakāya nature—
Grant your blessings, so that our fortune may become the equal of yours!
May your form be beyond transference, endowed with the seven vajra qualities,
So that you abide just like Amitāyus, Lord of Boundless Life, himself!
And may the garlanded rays of your sun-like beneficence
Reach out to fill the heavenly skies throughout this world!

Lamenting Prayer to Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö
Wisdom being Mañjughoṣa, core of all the victorious ones’ enlightened minds,
In the guise of a great pioneer of the non-sectarian Dharma,
Boundless in your strength and wise, loving intelligence,
Glorious and incomparable guru, to you I pray.
The dark of this degenerate age obscures the light of Buddha’s teachings,
And we lack authentic dharma friends who could show us the way.
When all living beings are plagued by disease, famine and warfare,
How, in your compassion, could you consider ignoring our plight?
Through the four bases of miraculous powers, you traversed the river
Of birth, old age, sickness and death, and through the force of the ten strengths,
You manifest emanations who pervade infinite realms—
Once more, may you usher in such a dawn of auspicious signs!
Let the hundred lights of your exalted aspiration dispel the darkness of this degenerate age,
As through your strength of liberation, you uphold the Sage’s teaching in its entirety.
To fulfil the aspirations of the Lord of Sages and the Lotus-Born
For disciplining beings of decadent times, arise, I pray, in nirmāṇakāya form!
Let your three secrets be victorious in the battle with obstructing forces,
So that you may carry out the remainder of your ocean-like activity
And swiftly guide and care for disciples like me—
Precious guru, bring this about with immediate effect!
Through the truth and blessings of the victors and their heirs throughout space and time,
And through the vajra oaths of those on the path of training,
Let all the splendour of virtue and auspiciousness unfold,
So that all these points of aspiration are spontaneously fulfilled!

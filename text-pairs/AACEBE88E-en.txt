Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
along with a great saṅgha of twelve thousand monks. Among them wer
venerable Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya
venerable Aśvajit
venerable Bāṣpa
At that time the earth shook in six different ways, And the buddha realms were pervaded with stainless light
“Then the god Śakra, the husband of Śacī, And the principal of all gods, opened the gates
A hundred million gods preceded the Bodhisattva, And the nāgas and gods offered him their veneration as he left
Gatherings of gods and demigods, along with Śakra, Escorted the Bliss-Gone One as he was leaving
“The goddesses, so skilled in playing music, Praised the qualities of the Bodhisattva
“Each of the gods also expressed this desire, saying, ‘I also want to carry the guide of this world.
As divine maidens surround you and attend to you, You will delight in divine sense pleasures.
“Gopā, even if I were to speak for seven days About the offerings that humans and gods arranged At the time of our King’s departure from home, I would not be able to cover it all
I believe that you shall become just like him, the most noble being!
Monks, through the blessing of the Bodhisattva, Chanda told King Śuddhodana, the Śākya princess Gopā, the retinue of consorts, and everyone else among the Śākyas what had happened in order to alleviate their suffering
He adopted the lifestyle of a renunciant in order to act in agreement with the perception of worldly people, and also because he felt compassion for others and wished to mature them
Next the Bodhisattva went to the hermitage of a brahmin woman called Padmā, who also invited the Bodhisattva to stay for a meal
Later he went to the hermitage of a sagely priest called Raivata, who offered the Bodhisattva hospitality in the same way
Likewise Rājaka, the son of Datṛmadaṇḍika, also invited him as a guest. Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva slowly made his way to the city of Vaiśālī
“Oh, look at his figure!” The students replied, “Yes, we see him. He is amazing.
Monks, I walked up to where Ārāḍa Kālāma was staying and addressed him in the following way: “Ārāḍa Kālāma
I have come to learn spiritual practices from you.” Ārāḍa Kālāma replied, “Gautama, I shall give you a teaching through which a faithful person of good family can accomplish omniscience with very little hardship.
Monks, I then practiced on my own in solitude with carefulness and diligence. And indeed, with only little hardship, I was able to understand and actualize the teaching
“Yes, Gautama, indeed I have,” he replied. I then told him, “I have also understood and actualized this teaching.
His mind is peaceful and his actions are gentle
He resides on the slope of Pāṇḍava, the king of mountains
As the Bodhisattva knows that day has broken, He dons his robes, so beautiful to behold. Holding his alms bowl with a humble attitude
He enters Rājagṛha on his alms round. Like gold, he is of refined nature And bears the thirty-two marks
When men and women see him, They cannot get enough of beholding him
Your Majesty, you are most fortunate!
King Bimbisāra gives the Bodhisattva some alms And tells his men, “Find out where he goes.” Seeing that he returns to the best of mountains, they report back: “Your Majesty, he is staying on the face of the mountain!
Knowing that the night has passed, King Bimbisāra, surrounded by a large retinue, Arrives at the root of Pāṇḍava, the king of mountains
He dismounts from his chariot and proceeds on foot
With great devotion he beholds the Bodhisattva Sitting cross-legged on a cushion of grass, Immutable, like the central mountain
The king touches his head to the Bodhisattva’s feet. As they discuss many issues, the king says, “I will give you half my kingdom. Enjoy the sense pleasures here; I will give you all you need.
When I see you, I am filled with supreme joy
From now on, please do not sit on grass on the ground. Your body is so young and fresh
Ignoble desires are condemned by the wise ones
I have abandoned desire like putrid snot. 
Desires fall like fruit from trees
They pass like clouds and rain
Unstable and fleeting, they move like the wind
“Your Majesty, consider how unstable the body is
There is no substance to the body—it is like a machine of suffering
It constantly leaks from the nine openings
Your Majesty, I have no desire for pleasures
Are you a member of the ruling class, a priest, or a king? Monk, please tell me everything, if you don’t mind.
Your Majesty, I am from the city of Kapilavastu of the Śākyas, A wonder-filled city of which you may have heard. My father’s name is Śuddhodana. I renounced this city because I wished for deeper qualities.
The king of Magadha says
Good! We are so glad to see you! As for your life, we too can learn from it. Also forgive me for my earlier intention To invite the One Free from Desire to enjoy sense pleasures. 
If you do become awakened, Dharma Lord, please share the Dharma with me
Self-Born One, that you now live in my country Is for me the greatest gift of all.
The Protector of the World came to the city in Magadha; Peacefully, he stayed as long as he wished
When he had accomplished the welfare of gods and humans, The Lord of Men proceeded to the banks of the Nairañjanā River
This concludes the sixteenth chapter, on the visit of King Bimbisāra
unworthy of a noble one
and attended by undesired consequences. In the long run it will prevent you from practicing your religion
You will become distracted and unable to develop nonattachment. You will not enter into the state of cessatio
nor develop higher knowledge, or attain the perfect awakening of nirvāṇa
On the other hand, straying from the middle way, you will not pass beyond suffering
If you mistreat your body so that it suffers and is harmed, you will face difficulties as can be observed right now, and in the future even further misery will fall on you
What are these four? Suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads to the cessation of suffering
“What is suffering? It is the pain that accompanies birth, growing old, falling sick, and dying. It also includes the suffering of meeting the unpleasant and parting from the pleasant. Not finding what is being sought is also suffering. In short the five perpetuating aggregates are suffering
“What is the path that leads to the cessation of suffering
It is exclusively the eightfold path of the noble ones. This is the path that starts with correct view and ends with correct concentration
It is called the path that leads to the cessation of suffering—a noble truth
“Monks, these four truths are the truths of the noble ones
On the path the aggregates are perceived to be the equality of phenomena; Infinitely diminished in harmony with the law of decay, they cease
“Through conceptual thinking, which is superficial, Ignorance arises; it has no other source
When you eliminate the cause of formations, there is no passing on; Consciousness arises dependent on passing on
“Likewise name and form appear from consciousness; From name and form, the six sense fields appear.  When joined with these six sense fields, it is said that contact appears
The clinging in turn perpetuates all existence, And based on existence, one’s birth occurs. “Rooted in birth, the stages of old age, sickness, and death follow
Even up to the Palace of Brahmā, The news went out from person to person: “The Protector of the World Has turned a stainless wheel
In this web of existence, there are many types of birth. Likewise all beings appear from conditions, With no self or person who transmigrates
Others, however, say that there were eighty million deities Present from the realm of form. Their vision was purified At the time of the turning of the wheel of Dharma. The , humans Who had congregated there Purified their eyes And were liberated from all unfavorable rebirths
Immediately the Thus-Gone One’s unbounded voice went out into the ten directions
And no action that can be observed as performed, be it good or bad
“All phenomena are causally produced; Beyond limits and without consciousness, they are like space. There is no agent and likewise no one who feels
My wisdom vision had been developed, my births had been exhausted
I had carried out my religious practice, I had done what needed to be done, and I will not have another life
“However, monks, once I had recited the four truths of the noble ones three times
I developed the wisdom that sees their twelve aspects. At that point my mind was free an
my insight was now free and pure. Monks, at that point I declared that I had awakened to unsurpassable, perfect and complete buddhahood
and that as the head of the congregation, he was well-known, popular, venerated by the masses, and recognized by all scholars
Still I did not develop the wisdom that sees their twelve aspects. Monks, therefore I did not make any claims of having awakened to unsurpassable, perfect and complete buddhahood, and I still lacked the insight of wisdom
Witnessing this, the Bodhisattva thought to himself
“Monks, in this way I genuinely contemplated each of the four truths of the noble ones while I recited them three times
“Rudraka, the son of Rāma, is really in charge of a group, indeed a large group; he is the head of the congregation and, moreover, well-known, popular, venerated by the masses, and recognized by all scholars
The Blessed One replied, “Maitreya, the wheel of Dharma is profound because it cannot be grasped by the intellect. This wheel is hard to see because it is beyond duality
This wheel is hard to comprehend because it is not an object of conceptual investigation
This wheel is hard to discern because it is related to the sameness of wisdom and consciousness
“This wheel is without any blemishes because it leads to the attainment of liberation, which is free from any obscurations. This wheel is subtle because it cannot be exemplified
This wheel is essential because it leads to the attainment of vajra-like wisdom
This wheel is indestructible because it preexists its own turning
This wheel encompasses everything because it is equal to the sky. 
Maitreya, this wheel of Dharma has the nature of the essence of all phenomena. It is a wheel with the power to teach
It is a wheel beyond birth, cessation, and enduring
It is a wheel without the all-ground. It is a wheel of the Dharma-way of nonconceptuality to its full extent
“It is a wheel of emptiness, a wheel of signlessness
It is a wheel free from the two extreme views in the understanding of interdependence
 However, unless I begin to practice disciplined conduct and austerities myself in his presence, he will never perceive me as someone special
It is a wheel without disturbance within the realm of phenomena beyond center and edge
“It is a wheel of the effortless and ceaseless activity of the Thus-Gone One. It is a wheel beyond activity and nonactivity
It is a wheel utterly ungraspable. It is a wheel beyond effort and effortlessness, an inexpressible wheel
It is a wheel that is like the nature of phenomena. It is a wheel of entering the sameness of all phenomena within a single sphere
“It is a wheel that never reverses and continuously bestows guidance and blessings on sentient beings that are deprived of freedom
It is a wheel of entering the way of the ultimate truth, which assumes nonduality
It is a wheel that genuinely subsumes the realm of phenomena. This wheel is immeasurable because it transcends all limits
“This wheel cannot be enumerated because it is beyond something that can be counted
This wheel is inconceivable because it is beyond the realm of conceptual mind. This wheel is unequaled because it is beyond equality
Accepting interdependence does not disturb its peace; it is infinitely peaceful. It is reality itself. Its nature is none other than that, not like that, or neither
“It speaks the languages of all beings. It suppresses all demonic forces and defeats the extremists. It is an escape from cyclic existence
It is the entering into the realm of the buddhas. It is understood by noble beings and realized by solitary buddhas
The bodhisattvas embrace it. It is praised by all the buddhas. It is indivisible from all the thus-gone ones
“What is it you understand?” Rudraka replied, “The way of equilibrium, which is neither perception nor nonperception.
“Maitreya, such is the wheel of Dharma that the Thus-Gone One turns
It is when the Thus-Gone One turns this wheel that he is called a thus-gone one
“He is also called the one who turns the wheel of Dharma, the liberal provider of the gift of Dharma, lord of the offerings
the one who grants offerings perfectly, the one who accomplishes disciplined action
I will go to Rudraka, the son of Rāma
the one who fulfills all aims, the teacher, the one who gives comfort, the hero, and the one who abandons disturbing emotions
“He is also known as the one who has conquered in battle,  the one who hoists the parasol, the victory flag, and the banner
the one who shines, the radiant one, the one who dispels darkness, the torchbearer
the great king among physicians, the perfect healer, and the great remover of pain
“He is the one who sees wisdom perfectly clear, the one who sees all around, the one who looks all around, the one with eyes in all directions
the one who shines in all directions, the one who lights up the world all around, the one who faces all directions, the universal sun, the universal moon, the one beautiful in every way
and the one who never abides and neither accepts nor rejects. 
He does not feel elated or depressed, and therefore he is known as the one similar to the earth. Since he is unshakable, he is known as the king of mountains
He is called the irreversible Dharma because of his realization that penetrates all phenomena
“He is like the water because he is purified of evil and always has pure thoughts and stainless body and mind
He is like the sky because he has actualized the wisdom of the realm of phenomena, without center or edge, within the range of nonclinging wisdom
“He is known as the one who abides in a liberated state of unobstructed wisdom because he has abandoned all the different obscuring phenomena
Next the Bodhisattva asked
He is called the one with a body that issues forth entirely from the realm of phenomena because he transcends the path of space-like vision
He is called the supreme being because he has no disturbing emotions caused by worldly objects
“He is called the nonclinging being, the one with the limitless intellect
With this the Bodhisattva went off and sat down with his legs crossed
the teacher of the Dharma that transcends the world, the spiritual preceptor of the world
the physician of the world, the most sublime in the world
Now, no sooner did the Bodhisattva sit down before he actualized hundreds of all the main types of worldly and transcendent equilibriums in all their many details.  The reason he could do this was because he had become a master of his mind, possessing a superior accumulation of merit and wisdom, a special fruition of all his previous trainings, and a distinctive familiarity with all absorptions
the one worthy of offerings
the one who has gone beyond the world, the light of the world, and the one transcending the world
the one honored by the world, the ultimate refuge of the world
the most excellent in the world, the foremost in the world, lord of the world
the great field of merit, the great being, the supreme being, the most supreme being, the unexcelled being, the being with no one above, the unequaled being, and the unique being. “He is called the one who always rests in equanimity, the one who rests in the equality of all phenomena
It does not make one a mendicant or a priest, and it does not lead to nirvāṇa.
the one who removes the burdens, the one who postpones his own benefit
the one who has exhausted all bonds to existence
and the one who has been freed by the wisdom of equality
“He is called the one who has perfected all supreme powers of the mind
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva made up his mind regarding Rudraka, the son of Rāma, and his followers. He left them, saying, “This is enough; I am leaving.

the one who has discovered higher knowledge through concentration

“He is known as the one who attained the light because he possesses the branches of awakening, such as the foundations of mindfulness, the authentic eliminations, the bases of miraculous powers, the faculties and the powers, as well as tranquility and insight. 
He is the one who crossed the ocean of saṃsāra, the one who came to the other shore

He is known as the one who sees all phenomena with unobscured wisdom
“He is like the moon, the one that beings never tire of beholding

His body is beautifully embellished with the eighty excellent signs. He is the foremost among men
He is the one with the ten powers
He is endowed with all supreme aspects and therefore is known as the one who has purified the surface of the mirror of wisdom
Because he has realized equality in relation to dependent origination, he is the one who abides in emptiness
Because he realizes the way of the ultimate truth, he is the one who abides in signlessness. Since he is unstained by any undertaking, he abides in wishlessness
Since his sphere of wisdom is not disturbed regarding the authentic limit, he is known as the one who speaks the truth

Monks, by that point the Bodhisattva had remained in Rājagṛha for as long as he wanted, and now he left together with the five ascetic companions in order to wander through the kingdom of Magadha
Somewhere on the road between Rājagṛha and Gaya, they met a group of people who were enjoying a feast
He is said to be like the king of gems, the wish-fulfilling jewel, because he has genuinely fulfilled his aim of attaining nirvāṇa according to the way
“For so long he has abandoned killing and therefore he is the One with Broad Heels
“For so long he has inspired others to abandon killing living beings, so he is the One with Long Fingers
This group called out to the Bodhisattva and the five ascetic companions and invited them to sit down and participate in the feas
“For so long he has explained the benefits of desisting from killing, so he is called the Protector of Many People
“For so long he has been acquiring increasingly superior roots of virtue, so he is the One with Arched Feet
“For so long he has steadfastly applied himself to praising the religious life of monks, priests, and other religious practitioners, and giving them all the necessary supplies. He has given clothing to the naked and never approached another man’s woman
He has explained the virtues of spiritual practice  and preserved his self-dignity, and therefore he is the One Who Has His Private Parts Well Sheathed

“For so long he has known the right measure in eating and has only eaten a little in a restricted manner. He has given medicine to those weakened by the travails of self-control

He has also offered ornaments, golden vessels, and golden-colored garments

He has examined the meaning, evaluated it, and gained full certainty. He has cleaned away the insects, spider webs, faded flowers, various weeds, and sand from the memorials of the thus-gone ones. Therefore he is the One with Untangled Hair. 
For so long he has showed respect to parents, leaders, elders, holy people, monks, priests, beggars, destitute beings, and many others who have come to him
satisfying their wishes by providing them with food, drinks, bedding, medicine, clothes, homes, lamps, and all the manufactured necessities of life, plus wells and lotus ponds filled with cool water. Therefore he is the One with the Seven Protuberances
“For so long he has showed respect to parents, monks, priests, spiritual teachers, and worthy ones by rising for them, welcoming them, and addressing them honestly

The names of these ten village girls were Balī, Balaguptā, Supriyā, Vijayasenā, Atimuktaka­malā, Sundarī, Kumbhakārī, Uluvillikā, Jāṭilikā, and Sujātā
These young girls now prepared various types of soups for the Bodhisattva and offered them to him
People now began calling him “the beautiful monk” and “the great monk.
Monks, since six years had passe
I had this thought
“My saffron robes have really aged. Perhaps it would be good if I could find some cloth to cover me.
“Now I have obtained water
so it would be good if I could also find a flat stone on which to wash this cloth.
At that very moment Śakra placed such a rock before him, and the Bodhisattva now began to wash the dusty rag
Śakra, king of the gods, then spoke to the Bodhisattva
However, the Bodhisattva wanted to demonstrate the conduct of a renunciant, so he did not give the cloth to Śakra. Instead he washed it himself
However, Māra, the evil one, felt jealous and magically raised the edge of the pond
“Listen, goddess, lower one of your branches!
Previously you made the aspiration, ‘May the Bodhisattva take my food and thereby truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening!’ Now that time has come, so you must do what you ought to be doing.
“The one for whom you have been making offerings has relaxed his discipline and decided that he will once again eat nourishing and solid food
At midnight the gods announced the following to Sujātā, daughter of the villager Nandika, in the village Senāpati in Urubilvā
The Bodhisattva accepted this gift, and the following morning he put on these fabrics, arranged them into a monk’s robes, and went to the nearby village
offered the Bodhisattva divine fabrics that had been dyed in saffron-red color, as is suitable for a monk
Today this place is still known as “The Sewing of the Dusty Rags.
“Sujātā has offered this food, and if I eat it now
there is no doubt that I shall truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening.
The Bodhisattva told her
“Well then, do as you please. But I do not give food to anyone without also giving them a bowl.
The village girl Sujātā also collected all the hair and the beard of the Bodhisattva. Thinking that it must be sacred
Many trillion gods came to collect the perfumed water that the Bodhisattva had used for bathing. They brought it with them to their own abodes in order to enshrine it in memorials and venerate it
He put down his bowl and rope and entered the water to refresh himself

Yet the great wealth and renown he enjoyed were like drops of water rolling off the petals of a lotus flower. The Blessed One remained detached and untainted by it all
The teachings he gave were virtuous in the beginning
virtuous in the middle
and virtuous in the end
Sublime in both word and meaning
the Dharma he taught was at once distinct
complete, pure, and wholesome. He taught all these beings how to live a life of purity
One evening during his midnight session
“As the king of doctors, he dispenses divine nectar, Conquering the evil hordes with his courageous eloquence
“Monks, this evening a group of gods from the pure realms came before me. Among them were Īśvara
Maheśvara, Nanda
“They prostrated at my feet, circumambulated me, And gathered here before me
Sunanda, Candana, Mahita, Praśānta
“Monks, last night as I rested here
Please teach this now to benefit the multitude of beings and bring them happiness
Please teach it out of compassion for the world and to benefit the myriad of beings
gods and humans alike
Please teach it to benefit the bodhisattva great beings of the present as well as the future
Please teach it to bring benefit and happiness.
Out of compassion for the great bodhisattvas, for the great listeners, for gods, humans, and demigods, and indeed for the entire world, the Blessed One remained silent, thereby offering his consent
Thus, Able One, please grant us your lucid explanations.
Monks, the Bodhisattva dwelt in the supreme realm of the Heaven of Joy
where he was honored by offerings
received consecration
and was praised and revered by one hundred thousand gods
 He had achieved his goal and was elevated by his former aspirations
His intelligence was such that he had attained the entire range of the Buddhadharma
Indeed his eye of wisdom was at once both vast and utterly pure. Radiating with mindfulness, intelligence, realization, modesty, and joyfulness, his mind was extremely powerful
He had mastered the perfections of generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, mental stability, knowledge, and skillful means
and was adept in the fourfold path of Brahmā: great love, great compassion, great joy, and great equanimity. With great awareness, he was free of obscurations and had manifested the vision of wisdom free from attachment
Illuminating all the pure realms, the light attracted Maheśvara and innumerable other gods
A god of gods, revered by gods and humans alike
It shows how he enjoyed his retinue of consorts and the pleasures of his kingdom
showing how he manifested as a bodhisattva and destroyed the legions of Māra

Teach it to be our doctor and to bring us happiness
Teach it to propagate this Great Vehicle
Then indeed, in order to conform to worldly conventions, the Bodhisattva dwelt among , women and showed himself to partake of the amorous games with pleasure
Among the , women, the Śākya girl Gopā was consecrated as the foremost wife
However, no matter who the Śākya girl Gopā encountered, whether it was her mother-in-law, her father-in-law, or any other member of the inner quarters, she did not cover her face
Please teach it to defeat our opponents and overpower all demonic forces
to instruct all the bodhisattvas and inspire all those who follow the Bodhisattva Vehicle to arouse diligence
So people criticized her and spoke badly of her, saying, “A new wife is supposed to be covered, but this one is always exposed.
to embrace the true Dharma and ensure the continuity of the Three Jewels
The Śākya girl Gopā heard this rumor, and in front of all the folk of the inner quarters, she said these verses
“A noble being shines when uncovered, Whether sitting, standing, or walking
Like a precious gem beaming, Radiant on the pinnacle of a standard
With happiness and delight
“While going, a noble being shines, And likewise while coming, a noble being shines. While rising or sitting, A noble being always shines
“A noble being shines when speaking, And even when silent, a noble being shines, Just like a nightingale does Whenever seen or heard
“Whether he wears clothes made of kuśa grass, Poor quality clothes, or his body is emaciated
One who is replete with good qualities and is adorned by those qualities Shines with his own radiance
Surrounded by the assembly of bodhisattvas, and with the saṅgha of listeners gathered before him
he sat down on the seat they had prepared and addressed the monks
Whereas an immature being who commits evil Never shines no matter what he wears
“Those who have evil in their hearts but whose speech is sweet Are like a jar of poison topped off with nectar
Like a rocky stone rough to the touch, they are hard inside; Being with them is like caressing a viper’s head
“The truly gentle are approached and honored by all
Just like a sacred bathing bank, which sustains everyone. Noble beings are like a jar filled with milk and curd
It is extremely auspicious to behold such a pure nature. “Those who have long shunned evil companions
Who are now surrounded by precious spiritual friends, Who relinquish evil deeds and adhere to the teaching of the buddhas Are fruitfully auspicious to behold
who had engaged in proper conduct for a long time
Acting in perfect accordance with his words, his unerring statements were always genuine
“Those who control their bodies thus control all physical faults; Those who control their speech never confuse their words
Those with guarded senses are mentally composed and serene. What good is it to cover the face of such beings
“Others may be covered in a thousand garments, But if their minds are revealed to lack shame and modesty And if they have no good qualities and lack truthful speech
At once honest, straightforward, and free of guile, his mind was invincible. Free of pride, conceit, arrogance, fear, and timidity, he was impartial toward all beings
Who are satisfied with their husbands and do not pine after others. When they shine unconcealed, like the sun and moon
And the assemblies of gods all know my thoughts. They know my discipline, qualities, restraint, and carefulness
The Bodhisattva had paid homage to countless awakened beings, to billions upon billions of buddhas
His loving gaze was revered by billions upon billions of bodhisattvas
Likewise Śakra
He then offered her a pair of fine cotton fabrics that were set with many different types of jewels, a pearl necklace worth a hundred billion silver coins, and a garland of gold set with red pearls. The king then offered this sentiment
“Just as my son is adorned with good qualities, His bride too is radiant with her own good qualities
Brahmā
Maheśvara
the guardians of the world
gods, nāga
Monks, the Bodhisattva now picked up an arrow, drew the bow, and released the arrow
His shot was so powerful that the arrow went right through the targets set up by Ānanda, Devadatta, Sundarananda, and Daṇḍapāṇi
The arrow then cleaved his own iron drum target, which was ten times shouting-distance away
then pierced the seven palm trees and the iron image of a boar before it finally entered the ground and disappeared
There, in the area where the arrow pierced the ground and vanished, a crater formed, which still to this day is called Arrow Crater
Then hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of surprise and cries of joy
The entire assembly of Śākyas was shocked and astonished
The gods in the sky then called out to King Śuddhodana and the masses
“O people, why be so amazed? Do you know what’s amazing
“He will sit on this earth, on the seat of the previous awakened ones
Holding the bow of calm abiding, he will shoot the arrows of empty lack of self
And so destroy the enemies, the afflictions; rend asunder the net of views
And attain sublime awakening—tranquil, stainless, and free from sorrow.
Having spoken thus, the gods approached the Bodhisattva, strewing him with divine flowers
balance and strength, heroics, gymnastics, elephant driving
Having perfectly discerned their every word, the Bodhisattva’s learned understanding of the teachings was at once unimpeded, discerning, and perfect
lassoing, rising, advancing, retreating

With the intention to travel beyond the four rivers
His higher knowledge was flawless, and his five types of superknowledge were fully manifest
he conquered Māra, subdued hostile forces
and defeated all of his opponents
this is the time to leave home, this is the time to take ordination
this is the time to recite, this is the time for deep reflection
this is the time to stay in solitude
He was an unerring vessel of mindfulness, able to recall the teachings of all the buddhas. The number of dhāraṇīs he had received was infinite
the bases of miraculous power, the faculties, the powers
Indeed he set himself at the frontlines and destroyed the enemy hordes of the afflictions with the firm vajra weapon of supreme wisdom
Or spinning the unexcelled wheel of Dharma in its twelve aspects
On this topic, it is said
Whatever perfect beings abide in the worlds of the ten directions
It is through their special power that, accompanied by music
These verses and songs, so pleasant and sweet
Encourage the supreme being to renounce his home
“When witnessing others who suffer greatly
It was sprinkled with the water of profound diligence and had skillful means as its center
branches of awakening for its anthers, and mental stability for its stamen. This lotus arose from an immaculate ocean of a vast accumulation of virtues
This is your time, your moment; So, Supreme Sage, renounce your palace
They encourage the One Who Gods and Humans Venerate, saying, “This is the time for you to renounce your palace.
Monks, the home of the Bodhisattva was indeed exquisite, complete with the most perfect belongings
It was anything a person could wish for, full of all the things necessary for comfortable living
Like a divine palace, it had the very best of verandas, turrets, porticoes, skylights, corridors, upper floors, and terraces
It was adorned with all sorts of jewels in many different arrangements and patterns
Parasols, flags, and banners were hoisted
Fine bells made of gems hung from lattices, as did hundreds of thousands of silk streamers
There were garlands of pearls set with various precious stones, and bridges built with boards that were ornamented by all types of jewels
Flower garlands and decorations hung everywhere. Incense burners dispensed fragrant smoke, and silk canopies were spread above
Fragrant flowers from all seasons adorned the grounds, and the ponds were full of white lotus flowers in bloom
Swift and strong were his four bases of miraculous power
just as the claws and fangs of the four noble truths were extremely sharp
In all the many lotus ponds were flocks of many types of birds, such as leafbirds
parrots, mynas, cuckoos, swans, peacocks, wild geese, kunālas, and pheasants that all called out in their beautiful voices
He bared the fangs of the four communions with Brahmā and gathered others through the four ways of attraction with his head
With a well-proportioned body, due to having understood the twelve links of dependent origination
and a flowing mane of the complete perfection of the thirty-seven branches of awakening, along with awareness and wisdom
his mouth opened with the three gateways to liberation
His bedding was made of divine fabrics of the finest thread, and as soft to the touch as the kācilindika cloth
To cover his body he wore stainless white clothes of the finest quality, without any blemishes whatsoever
while his eyes indicated the utter purity of tranquility and insight
He dwelt in the mountain caves of mental stability, complete liberation, absorption, and deep meditation
Born of the jungles of the four activities and discipline
he was endowed with the ten powers, the fourfold fearlessness, and perfect might
There on his perfect couch, he lay surrounded by his wonderful retinue of consorts, who all resembled goddesses
“O Best of Men, in former times you were a virtuous king. When a person came before you and said
‘Please give me this land with its cities and villages,’ You gave it away with a happy and undisturbed mind
“In former times you were a personal priest to a king
You attended upon the masters and caused no harm to anyone
Best among priests, you established many ordinary beings in virtue
At that time an evil king cut off your limbs in anger
At that time milk flowed from your arms and legs
“In the past you were a sage’s son known as Śyāma
In the fine shelter of the mountains, you delighted in your difficult discipline
Yet when a ruler pierced you with his poisonous arrows
You were not disturbed, and only felt pity for him
“In the past, O Receptacle of Qualities, when you were a leader of a pack of deer
A hunter was carried off by a raging mountain torrent
Wishing to help, you carried him to dry land
Even as you brought your enemy to safety, you remained calm
“Perfect Man, in previous times you were born as the son of a priest
When your gem fell in the ocean, You dried out the ocean. As the strong and firm leader of human beings, you recovered the valuable gem
“Perfect Being, in times past you were born as a holy sage
The hairs on his body did not bristle with the fear of creation and destruction, nor did his valor ever diminish
Once when a priest approached you, saying, ‘Please give me your protection,’ Sage, you told him, ‘Venerable priest, I will rid you of the enemy.
He subdued the masses of extremists, who are like rabbits and deer
You gave away your body, while the priest kept his
letting out the great lion’s roar of no self
Indeed, with brilliant strength and diligence
Monks, while the Bodhisattva was staying in the midst of his retinue of consorts
“Your disciplined conduct and austerities are beyond compare
You are a receptacle of virtue, rich in qualities, treading the path of virtue
Your time has come to abandon your city and your land
Quick, establish beings in the virtuous actions of the victorious ones.
Although the tree died, you remained, remembering its kindness. The king of gods saw your virtues and rejoiced
He restored the perfect tree to its former glory
When gems of playful women, exquisitely dressed, their bodies adorned, Play sweet music on the best of instruments
However, monks, as time went on, many of these gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, as well as Śakra, Brahmā, and the world protectors, began to think to themselves
“You, Śaśiketu, have been a peaceful king with fine teeth, Loving and compassionate, with a crown jewel shining like the moon
 Such were your main deeds, mighty hero with the beautiful eyes of a king
As a king, for billions of years you have practiced generosity gladly
Like a stainless jewel, your discipline has been pure
The sight of him was beautiful to behold and pleasing to the mind, and his eye faculty was unobstructed
Like a female yak that protects her calf, you have guarded your discipline. Since you delight in discipline, you have done so much to benefit beings
“As a perfect elephant, the arrows of the evil hunter hit you, Yet you felt love and compassion for this harsh enemy and protected him
Lion of Men, remember your past aspirations
“For billions of lives, you generously made many lavish gifts
Lord of Men, this is your time for renouncing your home
You gave him your fine and beautiful tusks and did not relinquish your discipline
You displayed such discipline many times
With patience you will benefit others
You showed these people the ten virtues and established them on the path of Brahmā
People who had lost their king invited you and consecrated you to kingship
In the past you always provided others with every comfort
And although they were your executioners, you still remained forbearing
“Protector, once you were a bear, living in a mountain lair
At that time you rescued a man, frightened and terrified, out of an avalanche
You served him roots and berries and provided him with every comfort
Although he soon killed you and carried you off, you remained patient
“When through austerities, you sought awakening and wisdom of many qualities
You possessed fortitude, determination, unshakable resolve, and diligence
The strength of your diligence could overcome even the most powerful demon
With diligence you will unfold all good qualities; Your concentration and knowledge will have no equal in the three realms
Lion of Men, the time has come for renunciation
With compassion, you traveled swiftly through the sky to the land of demonesses
You rescued the men in distress and brought them to safety
Many times have you demonstrated such diligence
“In the past you were a well-to-do sage who delighted in concentration
Now, Perfect Being, the time has come for you to demonstrate your concentration
“With discipline you must perform austerities and hardship
Later, as they died, they all proceeded to the realm of Brahmā
“You have mastered the art of knowing the destinies of beings in all directions
All the girls were virtuous, agreeable, and wholesome in conduct
Inside this beautiful palace, the Bodhisattva woke up to the sound of conches, kettledrums, clay drums, wood drums, lutes, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and flutes that produced the most sweet-sounding and melodious tunes to accompany their many sweet songs
The girls woke up the Bodhisattva with beautiful and soft songs accompanied by the melodious tones of flutes
However, due to the grace of the blessed ones, the buddhas in the ten directions, the instruments suddenly began to encourage the Bodhisattva by resounding with these verses
The girls are delighted and joyful
They play fine melodies on beautiful instruments
At that moment, by the power of the victorious ones in the ten directions
These many verses can be heard, in all their diversity
“Seeing the beings who are forever without protector
Royal Son, today the time for renunciation has come
You instructed them in the straight path that destroys existence
You who conquer darkness, you have benefited the world greatly.
When you see these suffering beings, do not remain indifferent.
The pleasing and joyful women are adorned With fine clothes, gems, necklaces, perfumes, and flower garlands
They wake the Supreme Being with music and song
By the power of the victorious ones, the instruments call out these verses
“It was for the sake of others that for many eons You gave up what is hard to abandon and were disciplined, forbearing, and diligent
Through your training in concentration and knowledge, your time has come
Guide, quick, direct your mind toward renunciation, without delay
“Before you relinquished treasuries of jewels, gold, silver, and ornaments
In all those lives, you performed sacrifices of many types
“You have been powerful Sutasoma, Dīptavīrya, and Puñyaraśmi
Generous and powerful, you also acknowledged the kindness of others
You have been the king of Kāśi, Pradānasūra, Ratnacūḍa, and Śāntaga
When you were these rulers, as well as others, you gave what is hard to give
As you showered a rain of gifts then, may you now shower a rain of Dharma
“In the past you saw the best of beings, as numerous as sand in the Ganges
“At the beginning you offered Amoghadarśin a sāl flower; With a mind full of devotion, you gazed for a moment at Vairocana
You offered Dundubhisvara a myrobalan fruit
When you saw Candana’s house, you brought your grass torch and held it up
“When Reṇu entered the city, you scattered a handful of fragrant powder at him
When Dharmeśvara taught the Dharma, you applauded him
When you saw Samantadarśin, you declared your homage to him
You joyfully threw a golden chain toward Mahārciskandhin
“To Dharmadhvaja you offered a robe, and to Nirodha a handful of beans
You offered Jñānaketu a flower of the aśoka tree, and soup to Sārathi
You offered a candle to Ratnaśikhin, and medicine to Padmayoni
To Sarvābhibū you offered a pearl necklace, and to Sāgara a lotus flower
“You offered a canopy to Padmagarbha, and a rain cover to Siṃha
You bowed down to Jñānameru, and offered robes to Nāgadatta
“To Atyuccagāmin you offered the finest sandalwood, and a handful of salt to Tiṣya
You offered lotus flowers to Mahāvyūha, and jewels to Raśmirāja
To Śākyamuni you offered a handful of gold, and you praised Indraketu
You offered earrings to Sūryānanda, and a golden crown to Sumati
“To Nāgābhibhū you offered a jewel, and a cotton mat to Puṣya
To Bhaiṣajyarāja you offered a precious parasol, and a throne to Siṃhaketu
You offered Guṅāgradhāri a net of precious stones, and instruments to Kāśyapa
To Arciketu you offered powders of exquisite scent, and flowers to Caityaka
“You offered Akṣobhyarāja a multistoried palace, and a flower garland to Lokapūjita
To Tagaraśikhin you offered your kingdom, and to Durjaya much incense
You offered yourself to Mahāpradīpa, and jewel adornments to Padmottara
To Dharmaketu you offered various flowers, and blue lotuses to Dīpaṃkara
“In the past you made these and other offerings, Manifold and marvelous, to the best of beings
Remember the buddhas of the past and your offerings to these teachers
Do not abandon those who suffer without protection; leave your home
“Merely seeing Dīpaṃkara, you attained supreme forbearance, And discovered, accordingly, the five indestructible clairvoyant perceptions
Subsequently you performed inconceivable offerings For limitless eons to all the buddhas in all the universes
Where are all your past bodies and names now? All things perish by nature; there is no permanence in conditioned things
Delights, kingdoms, and enjoyments are impermanent, so leave this perfect city
“Like the fierce and terrifying inferno, when this eon comes to an end, Old age, sickness, and death bring great and terrible fear
In the end, all things are conditioned and therefore cannot last; Look at those who suffer intensely and, Capable One, renounce.
As the retinue of women wake up the Lord of Men
Who was resting in his comfortable bed, With sounds of lutes, flutes, and other instruments
At that time the following words come from within the sounds of the instruments
“The three worlds are ablaze with the suffering of old age and sickness
This world is ablaze with the fire of death and without a protector
Always deluded in impure existence, Beings spin like a bee caught in a vase
“The three worlds are unstable, like autumn clouds
The birth and death of beings is like watching a play
The life of a being passes quickly, Like a lightning bolt in the sky or a mountain stream
“By the power of craving for existence and ignorance, Beings take birth as humans, gods, or in the three lower realms
In their ignorance they continuously circle among these five existences, Like the spinning of a potter’s wheel
Like the hunter’s snare catches a monkey
“The objects of enjoyment lead to much suffering and harm
They bring fear, make enemies, and lead to depravity
A noble being will reject them like a bowl of excrement, The edge of a sword, or poison ivy
“The objects of enjoyment always bring fear and depravity; They make us suffer when we think of them, and they make us blind
They always produce causes of fear and are the root of suffering
They make the vine of craving for existence grow
Or they see it like a great swamp, or like walking on swords, Or like the edge of a knife smeared with honey
“Like a viper’s head or a bowl of excrement, So the wise ones understand desire
Desires are like a pang of pain, and as fragile as a bird’s egg; Like a bone among dogs, they are the prime cause of enmity
The learned ones realize that these objects emerge from conceptualization
“At first in youth, when one has a fine body, One is liked and desired and acts like a child
Yet when old age, suffering, and diseases conquer the splendor of the body, One is abandoned, just like a dried-up river is abandoned by deer
“When one is powerful with the best of wealth, grains, and possessions, One is liked and desired and acts like a child
Yet when the wealth is spent and suffering sets in, One is abandoned, just like an empty wilderness
“Like a tree with flowers and fruits, People love a person who delights in giving
Yet when the wealth is gone, one becomes a beggar, miserable in old age; At that point, just like a vulture, one becomes disliked
“When one is powerful, rich, and handsome, one is like a lord; People like to meet such a being, and one pleases their senses
Yet when one is old, suffering from disease, and all wealth is spent, One becomes as disagreeable as death
“When one is old and youth has passed, Like a tree struck by lightning, One is worn out and terrifying to others, like a ruined house
Sage, quick, tell us how to avoid old age! “Old age withers men and women
Just as the mālu ivy does to a thick sāl forest. Old age robs one’s diligence, energy, and power, Like a person caught in a swamp
“Old age makes the beautiful person ugly; Old age steals one’s splendor and robs one’s power
Old age takes your happiness and defeats you; Old age brings death and destroys your vital force
Look at those beings that are overcome by old age and sickness, And, quick, explain how to be free of suffering
So, alas, do sickness and old age rob the vitality of beings And destroy their faculties, bodies, and strength
“Old age and disease exhaust all stores of wealth and grain; They bring great anguish to beings
They create resentment and bring animosity among loved ones; They torment everyone intensely, like the sun in the sky
“When the time of passing away has arrived, One is always separated from one’s favorite possessions and loved ones
There will be no returning or meeting again, Just as fruits or leaves taken by the river never meet the tree again
One must proceed alone, without friend or company; One is powerless but to follow the results of one’s actions
“Death devours beings by the hundreds, Like a sea monster devouring numerous beings
Or like a garuḍa devouring a nāga, or an elephant catching a lion
Or how a fire devours plants, herbs, and living creatures
“To liberate beings from these hundreds of calamities, Thus you made your aspiration
Now remember that aspiration of bygone times; The time for leaving your home has come.
Nothing lasts longer than a flash of lightning in the sky
Their nature is to break, like an unbaked earthen vase
They are like things on loan from another, Or a city of sand, so short-lived are they
“All these conditioned things are impermanent by nature
Like mud plaster applied during the rains, Or the sandy banks of the river, They depend on conditions and have a feeble nature
Like the wind, they do not remain
Like foam, they are feeble and insubstantial
“Conditioned things are inert and empty
When examined they are like the stem of the plantain tree
They are like an illusion that deceives the mind
They are like an empty fist that tricks children
“All conditioned things come about Based on causes and conditions
One causing the other, they arise in dependence, Yet all the childish beings do not recognize this
“Just as valvaja grass depends on muñja grass To give a rope proper strength
Or just as a bucket in a well depends on a winch— One unable to function without the other
“So too function the twelve links of dependent origination
“The seal makes the mark of the seal appear
Yet the seal itself was not transferred anywhere
It is not in the mark, yet it is also not elsewhere
In this way the formative factors are beyond annihilation and permanence
“It is based on the eye and form That the eye consciousness appears
Yet the form is not dependent on the eye, Nor is the form transferred to the eye
“Although all of this is without a self and is repulsive, Beings perceive it as having a self and as beautiful
Although that is a mistaken and corrupt imputation, The eye consciousness arises from it
“The consciousness ceases and rearises. The practitioner observes this arising and ceasing of consciousness
It goes nowhere and it does not come from anywhere
The practitioner perceives consciousness as empty and illusory
They check in all directions, And find that nothing comes and nothing goes
“The conditions for the aggregates, the sense fields, and the elements Are ignorance, craving, and karma
When all of these assemble, that is called a sentient being, Although ultimately nothing is there
“Based on the lips, throat, palate, and tongue, The sounds of syllables are produced
This is not so with just the throat or the palate; No sound can be found in them individually
“Speech occurs based on all of these things coming together; It emerges based on the power of mind and intelligence
Yet mind and speech are by nature invisible; They are nowhere to be found, inside or outside
“When the learned ones analyze the coming and going Of speech, voices, sounds, and tunes
They see that all speech is like an echo, Momentary and without substance
“When some skillful people analyze this and wonder
‘Where does the sound come from and where does it go?
They may search in all directions, Yet never find the origin of sound or its destination
“This is how all compounded phenomena appear, Based on causes and conditions
The practitioner, by observing the true nature of conditioned things, Sees that these things are all empty and inert
“The aggregates, sense fields, and elements Are empty within and empty without
They all lack a self and do not abide
Close the gates to the three lower realms
“Keep your discipline and fulfill your wishes; Remember your past actions
And open the gates to the nectar of the higher realms
He was skilled in ripening and training others

He made religious offerings
He never refused, but gave courageously with an open hand

He engaged all beings equally and possessed an unimpeded analytical capacity
His intention was enhanced by the sublime and perfectly complete austerities and spiritual practices that he observed on the path of the ten virtuous activities
As the king of Dharma, he turned the precious wheel of the supreme Dharma without hindrance, having been born into a line of universal monarchs
He was disciplined, skilled, and behaved correctly
He guarded carefully all his physical, verbal, and mental acts
he never tired of study. Thus his boundless wisdom had become vast and all-encompassing. His discipline was beyond measure as well
Indeed his mind was as vast as the oceans and the earth
Equal to earth, water, fire, and air
He had the sharp vajra weapon of supreme wisdom
He conquered all opposing forces of disturbing emotions
He was free from attachment and aversion
with a mind as pristine and open as the center of space; it was vast and unlike any other
His superior intent was utterly pure
He would dedicate his awakening to all beings
His power was compassion, and his strength was courage. He did not turn back
He had complete impartiality with regard to all beings, and his weapon was generosity
He was able to satisfy the hopes and wishes of others
He was a vessel fit for awakening who continuously realized the Dharma
He did not lower his banner
When he gave, his generosity was not involved with subject, object, and action
and exhibited fear of even the smallest unwholesome act
His discipline was perfectly pure
Mentally he had abandoned all stains and was now clean and spotless
He had no harmful wishes, never did any damage
which was simply unshakable. He was perfectly forbearing and gentle
and was utterly free from any ill will
He had given rise to a fervent diligence that was set on helping all other beings
It was a firm resolve
He could not be turned back from accomplishing all the practices that are the roots of virtue
He was skilled in analyzing phenomena
he practiced all such virtues for seven incalculable eons
He had found the light, and all darkness had disappeared for him
He practiced the seven forms of generosity and engaged in the five types of action that create merit
He was mindful and composed
His mind was not distracted, and he rested one-pointedly in concentration
just as he tread the path of the ten virtues—the three physical, the four verbal, and the three mental wholesome actions—and practiced the forty kinds of correct application
Likewise did he make the forty kinds of correct aspiration
immerse himself in the forty kinds of right intention
His mind was purified by tranquility and insight
He perceived the truth of dependent origination
Since he had realized the truth, he was not reliant on others
He mastered the three gateways to liberation
He had realized that all phenomena are like an illusion, a mirage, a dream, a moon reflected in water, an echo, or an optical illusion
He took ordination with four million buddhas and presented five and a half million buddhas with offerings
Similarly the Bodhisattva served , million solitary buddhas
Establishing innumerable sentient beings on the paths to the higher realms and liberation
he desired to become perfectly and completely awakened, to attain supreme, genuine, and complete awakening
With only one lifetime remaining
he passed away and was reborn in the supreme realm of the Heaven of Joy as a supreme divine child named Śvetaketu
The assembly of gods showed him great reverence, honoring him as one who would leave their midst and take birth in the human world
where before long he would become the Buddha, attaining perfect, complete, and unexcelled awakening
He dwelt in a celestial palace with , floors
adorned with verandas, domes, architraves, skylights, cool pavillions, multiple stories, and courtyards
This palace was filled with parasols, flags, and streaming banners; it was covered by canopies of tiny jeweled bells and strewn with māndārava and mahāmāndārava flowers
In this way he rested in wisdom
In this way he rested in a state of immense qualities
In this way he strove for the benefit of others
Encouraged even more by these verses, which emerged out of the sounds of the instruments through the blessings of the buddhas in the ten directions
the Bodhisattva at this point manifested four Dharma gates in order to mature his retinue of consorts, just as all previous bodhisattvas in their last existence had done
What are these four Dharma gates
The songs of millions upon millions of celestial maidens could be heard throughout
The second Dharma gate that he manifested is called the irreversible state. It produces the power of aspiration toward inexhaustible omniscience, and it ensures that the capacity of the Three Jewels is upheld and not wasted
Peerless strength, and great power
The third Dharma gate that he manifested is called putting great compassion into practice. It is a disposition of never abandoning any sentient beings
“Recall the power of your vast store of merit And the illuminating knowledge of your boundless intelligence
These are the four Dharma gates that the Bodhisattva manifested
Millions upon millions of gods turned their eyes toward the palace and gazed at it in awe
You have pacified conceit and flaws, relinquishing the three stains
The great and vast Dharma was proclaimed throughout, and thereby the force of their enthusiastic desire subdued all the afflictions
At that point, in order to mature his entire retinue of consorts
he produced many miraculous manifestations
By the power of the Bodhisattva
these miraculous displays caused hundreds of thousands of Dharma gates to emerge from the sounds of the music, such as the following
Practiced austerities and patience, subdued and diligent. With concentration and the strength of knowledge
Such words rang out from the musical instruments
“Through profound aspirations in one’s heart And the heartfelt compassion for beings
“You developed compassion for all sentient beings And made offerings to billions of buddhas
The mind of the most eminent awakening is born.
“Faith, devotion, dedication, respect
Lack of pride, and humility before the teachers
Inquiry and search for the nature of virtue
And training in mindfulness.” Such were the words that emerged
Now the time has come—do not let it slip away
“Immaculate One, destroyer of the afflictions, birth, and death: Gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, And the powerful demigods await you
You have ripened many gods and humans
Today the time has come, So please consider leaving home
A blind man cannot show the way
“If you are not free yourself, you will be unable to liberate others
If you are free, you can liberate others
A person with sight can show the way
“You must abandon your dominion and the sports of love, And the seven riches on the four continents
“Those beings who are slaves to desire— Attached to their house, wealth, sons, and wife— When being trained by you, May they too form a wish to leave their homes
When people hear that you have renounced all this, The world with its gods and humans will long for the same
“You are not delighted by desire
You rest in the bliss of concentration
Yet many hundreds of gods and humans
You awaken from their sleep. “The prime of life is very short
It passes quickly, like a cascading waterfall
As youth fades away
Leaving home will not seem appealing
Various birds flew through the air, singing out their beautiful melodies. Among them were parrots, śārikas, cuckoos, geese, peacocks, ducks, pheasants, snipe, partridge, and many others
Fulfill your promise And act in the interest of the host of gods
“Desired objects never satisfy
They are just like salty water from the ocean
Satisfied, however, are those who possess knowledge, The stainless noble ones who transcend the world
“You are the delight of King Śuddhodana’s kingdom, Who has won its hearts and minds
Your face is like a blooming lotus with hundreds of petals
So please consider departing now
So now please cast your gaze upon those who dwell In the lower realms, those who have no freedom
“Beings suffer from the burning torment of disturbing emotions
They are without refuge, bound in heavy fetters
Hero, quick, establish them in peace On the path to complete liberation
“You, the skilled physician
Please, quickly establish in the happiness of nirvāṇa The beings touched by diseases, who have suffered for so long, By dispensing the medicine of Dharma
You are the eye of gods and humans
So quick, shine the light of wisdom
“ ‘We must see the One Who Has Attained Awakening, And listen to the unexcelled Dharma.
So say the many gods, demigods, nāgas, Yakṣas, and gandharvas who are watching you
“The king of nāgas can see your splendor, Since it illumines even his abode
He brings boundless offerings
So fulfill his wish for disciplined conduct
“Protector, you are to conquer the works of Māra And bring defeat to the extremists
“ ‘At the feet of the Bodhi tree your mind shall be perfected
And we shall present you with four offering bowls.
So say the four guardians of the world and their armies
Who are all awaiting you
Has awakening not been placed in the palm of your hand? The time has now come—do not let it slip away
“Courageous One, like a great bank of clouds, You cover this world that blazes with the fire of afflictions
“Even Brahmā, the peaceful and compassionate one, Who speaks lovingly, awaits you, thinking, ‘I must request this lord of men To turn the unexcelled wheel.
“The gods who venerate awakening Are all present at the seat of awakening
“It is true that bodhisattvas Demonstrate their occupation with consorts
You, however, should be at the forefront
Do not fall behind them
“Remember the sweet-sounding and soft words Of Dīpankara when he gave his prophecy
As soon as the king awoke, he immediately asked the chamberlain
King Śuddhodana, sitting in the female quarters, thought to himself
With the healing salve of the threefold liberation
Bring these beings swiftly to the blissful state of nirvāṇa
“Then the young prince will surely leave us soon, as these omens foretell.
“Is the young prince with the consorts?” The chamberlain replied, “Yes, Your Majesty.
As a sharp pain shot through his heart, he began to scheme
“My young prince must never even set foot in the palace gardens
He must always remain inside with the maidens so that he will be addicted to their pleasures
“Not hearing the lion’s roar
Jackals yelp without fear
Then, in order for the young prince to enjoy himself, King Śuddhodana erected three palaces for each of the three seasons—hot, rainy, and cold
He must never leave us!
The Hot Season Palace was very cool
the Rainy Season Palace was both cool and warm
and the Winter Palace was naturally warm
At each palace five hundred guardsmen walked up and down the staircase
“Holding the lamp of knowledge in your hand, You have a power of strength and diligence unique upon the earth
The calls of these five hundred men could be heard half a league away
There were constantly young maidens around the Bodhisattva, playing their instruments, singing songs, and dancing for him
Monks, at that point the Bodhisattva told his charioteer
“Your Majesty, the young prince wishes to visit the parks
“My young prince has never been to the parks to see their lovely grounds. However, if I allow him to visit the parks, the young prince must be surrounded by women. That way he can really enjoy amorous delights and surely he will not leave us then
As King Śuddhodana had such love for the Bodhisattva and wanted to please him
You must all make sure that the young prince does not catch sight of anything disagreeable, so take care that everything that is not beautiful has been removed
Accordingly, on the seventh day, the entire city was beautifully adorned
The parks were also adorned with canopies of cloth in various colors, as well as parasols, flags, and banners
The road on which the Bodhisattva was to proceed had been sprinkled and swept, sprayed with perfumed water
and scattered with fresh flower petals
Incense burners dispensed fragrant smoke
and along the road vases had been placed and plantain trees planted
The road was shaded with silk canopies in many colors
and festooned with nets of tiny jewel bells and decorative garlands and tassels
Four army divisions had also taken position along the route, and members of the retinue were busy adorning the young prince’s consorts
Amid all this activity, while the Bodhisattva was exiting through the eastern gate of the city on his way to the parks
through the power of the Bodhisattva the gods from the pure realms emanated an old man on the road ahead
He was a decrepit old man, so skinny that the veins on his body protruded
His teeth had fallen out  and he was covered in wrinkles everywhere
His hair was gray and he was hunched over like the rafters in a gable roof
Weak and broken, he had to use a stick to keep himself from falling
He was in pain and his vitality was long gone
The only sounds that emerged from his throat were a dry wheezing
This concludes the second chapter, on the inspiration
As he stood there on the road, with the weight of his upper body supported by his stick, all his limbs were shaking and trembling
Emerging from that great celestial palace
the Bodhisattva went to the great Dharmoccaya Palace, where he taught the Dharma to the gods in the Heaven of Joy
In the palace, he seated himself upon a lion throne known as Sublime Dharma
For all beings, old age overcomes youth
Then I will reflect on what I hear.
The Bodhisattva then asked: “Is that a practice specific to his family, Or could that happen to anyone? Quick, tell me the truth
“Charioteer, who is this peaceful and calm person
He walks with his eyes toward the ground at a distance of six feet
He carries his offering bowl and is not overbearing or haughty.
The charioteer replied
“Your Highness, that person is what we call a ‘monk.
He has abandoned sensual enjoyments and now acts in a very gentle manner
He has become a mendicant and searches for peace
Free from attachment and anger, he lives from alms.
The Bodhisattva said
“What you say is very true, and I agree
Wise beings always praise the life of a monk
Such a life is beneficial for oneself and it also helps others
It is a happy life that results in the sweet nectar of immortality.
And so, monks, once again the Bodhisattva turned his fine chariot around and returned to the city
Monks, King Śuddhodana both saw and heard that the Bodhisattva had been inspired in these ways
So in order to guard the Bodhisattva even more, he erected a perimeter wall around the palace, dug trenches
and strengthened the gates
He also posted guards
alerted his brave soldiers
and even prepared the cavalry
All of them were in full armor
In order to guard the Bodhisattva
he placed a full army division at each of the junctions by the four city gates to keep watch day and night
and told them to prevent the Bodhisattva from eloping
Retinues with equally pure intentions accompanied the gods, without the assembly of divine maidens and even without ordinary gods
There are gates so solid that their noise can be heard for several miles
There are elephants, horses, chariots, and men in armor on rows of elephants
Altogether a retinue of  million entered the palace, each sitting on a lion throne according to rank
Ditches have been dug, and tall walls and archways with turrets have been built
Hiding their divine forms, they took on the guise of priests and taught the Vedas to other priests
All the Śākyas are worried and keep guard day and night
They made it known that one who entered the womb in this manner  would be a great being possessed of thirty-two marks
The great noise of the powerful army is heard everywhere
The city is in turmoil and full of terrified cries: “May the Gentle One not depart
If the holder of the Śākya lineage leaves, this royal line will be broken!
The women are told, “You must never stop your songs and music
You must make him stay, so captivate his mind with your games of pleasure
Demonstrate all your many ways of female trickery and make a good effort
Watch over him and create hindrances so that the Gentle Being does not depart!
These are omens that foretell the departure of the best of charioteers
Even the beautiful lotuses in the ponds and the pools wither and die
 The foliage and the flowers in the trees disappear, and the trees blossom no more
“Someone with such marks would become one of two things. There would be no third option,” they said
The strings on the lutes and the sitars break for no apparent reason
The drums, big and small, all break when touched and emit no sounds
“If such an individual were to live as a householder, he would become a universal monarch with a fourfold army
The whole city is disturbed and overcome by lethargy
Nobody has any desire for dancing, singing, or making merry
Even the king is severely depressed and given to brooding
He wonders, “Oh no, will the Śākya lineage, of such fortune, now be destroyed?
As Gopā and the prince lie asleep in the same bed
A dream appears to Gopā in the middle of the night
She dreams that the entire earth with all its mountains is shaken
The trees are rocked by the wind, and uprooted they fall to the ground
The sun, the moon, and the stars that adorn them fall from the sky onto the earth
She sees her shorn-off hair in her right hand, and her diadem crumbling into pieces
Her hands and feet are cut off and she finds herself naked
Her pearl necklace and the jewel in her girdle break apart
The four legs of her bed break off, and she ends up lying on the ground
The beautiful and splendorous handle of the king’s parasol is broken
All her ornaments fall off and are scattered about and carried off by water
Her husband’s ornaments, clothes, and crown lie scattered on their bed
Torches are carried out from the city, which is left behind in darkness
The beautiful jewel lattices she sees in her sleep are broken
The tassels of pearl fall off and the ocean is stirred
She dreams that Meru, the king of mountains, is shaken in its foundation
As she awakens with tearful eyes, she asks her husband
The Lord replies to Gopā in a voice as sweet as the nightingale, a drum, or Brahmā, “Cheer up! Nothing bad is in store for you
Only beings who have created previous merit have such dreams
People for whom there is suffering in store could never dream like that
“When you dream that the earth is shaken And the mountains crumble to the earth
It shows that gods, nāgas, rākṣasas, and bhūtas All rank you as the highest among those worthy of worship
“When you dream that the trees are uprooted And you cut off your hair with your right hand
It shows that you, Gopā, will quickly cut the web of afflictions And free yourself from the web of viewing conditioned phenomena
“When you dream that the sun and the moon fall to the ground And that the stars fall as well
It shows that you, Gopā, will quickly conquer the enemy of afflictions And will become worthy of offerings and praise from the world
“When you dream that your pearl necklace is torn And that you are naked and your body is mutilated
It shows that you, Gopā, can soon leave your female body And swiftly attain a male body
“When you dream that the legs of your bed break off And the precious handle of the parasol is broken
It shows that you, Gopā, shall quickly cross the four rivers And see me as the single parasol bearer in the triple universe
“When you dream that your jewelry is carried off by water And my clothes and crown are left behind on my throne
It shows that you, Gopā, shall quickly see me adorned with signs And receiving the praise of the entire world
“When you dream that billions of lights Leave the city and plunge it into darkness
It shows, Gopā, that soon I will illuminate with the light of knowledge The entire world, which is plagued by delusion and the darkness of ignorance
It shows that you, Gopā, shall quickly cut the web of affliction And remove your chain of conceptual perception
“Gopā, since you pay homage to me And always make offerings with the highest respect
Soon you shall have happiness and fortune
You shall never go to the lower realms or meet with suffering
“In the past I made abundant offerings
I guarded my discipline and always trained in forbearance
“For a limitless number of millions of eons in cyclic existence
Therefore whoever has faith in me Shall find happiness and fortune
I have trained in the perfect path to awakening
Therefore whoever has faith in me Shall eliminate the three lower realms
Gopā, with such good omens, lay down and sleep.
Birds of four colors change into one color
 In his dream four white-and-black animals lick his feet
Touched by this radiance, the misery of those who suffer disappears
“So be happy and do not be depressed! Be fulfilled and joyful! Soon you shall attain happiness and fortune
The entire earth becomes his bed, And the king of mountains is his pillow
He sees in his dream a light shining forth That clears away the deep darkness of the world
A parasol emerges from the ground and covers the entire three worlds
Such a being dreams that the waters in the four great oceans Are stirred with the strokes of his hands and feet
It penetrates trees and walls and casts no shadow
Someone with great qualities must have arrived here.
The king, worried, looked all around
And saw the pure being with eyes like lotuses
The noble one with pure heart then felt respect for his father
Standing in front of the king, he said
“My lord, now the time is right for me to leave home
Please do not hinder me and don’t be distraught
My king, may you, my family, and the people of the kingdom forgive me.
The king replied with tears filling his eyes
“What will it take for you to change your mind
Will you ask me for a boon? Tell me, I will give you anything
I am yours, and you can have the palace, the servants, and this whole kingdom.
Then, in a sweet voice, the Bodhisattva replied
“My lord, I wish for four boons. Please grant them to me
If you are able to give them to me, you will have power over me
You will always see me here at home and I will not depart
To retain my fine complexion and youth forever
divine wheel with one thousand spokes will appear from the east
May all your wishes be fulfilled.
“Then go and benefit and liberate beings. I rejoice in that
I wish that, after I die, I will not have to take rebirth again.
As high as seven tāla trees, the wheel, which is not made by a smith, is round with a central hub and made entirely of gold
Monks, then the Bodhisattva left and went to his own residence
where he lay down on his bed
No one had even noticed that he had left
The Śākyas replied
“The prince wants to abandon his home. What shall we do?
Monks, at daybreak King Śuddhodana gathered the entire Śākya clan and announced
“Your Majesty, let us guard him
Play music, sing songs, and stay awake and alert through the night
Wherever the wheel comes to rest,  there the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class and his four army divisions will set up their camp
Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī said to her servants
Even King Śuddhodana kept watch at the palace gate, accompanied by five hundred young Śākyas mounted on elephants and horses
followed by the universal monarch and his four army divisions
“The precious, divine wheel, set in motion by the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class, will magically travel through space to the east
Guard the prince so that he cannot leave without anybody knowing
Unless you must, do not open any door
Everyone must be on high alert! “First shut all doors, then lock them tight And place door bolts firmly across the door panels
Otherwise this noble being might escape
“Adorn yourselves with necklaces of jewels and pearls
“The king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class will then draw his cloak back from one shoulder and lower his right knee to the ground
Try to escape in a hasty manner, You should confront him in such a way That no harm is done to him
Who surround the bed of this pure being
You must not slip into laziness
But watch him with eyes like a butterfly
“In order to guard the prince
Adorn this palace with bejeweled lattices And take up your flutes and play them to your fullest
Protect the Stainless Being through the night
“Keep each other awake And do not take rest
With bountiful harvests, it is both delightful and populous. Indeed it is filled with people
Otherwise he may certainly leave his home behind, Abandoning the kingdom and all his subjects
“If he were to leave his home, Then the royal palace would become a place with no joy
The continuity of the royal lineage, which has endured so long, Would become interrupted.
Now that you have arrived in this land, lord, it is yours. We beseech you to stay.
Monks, at that point the twenty-eight great yakṣa generals, such as Pāñcika, met with the five hundred sons of Hārītī and voiced their concern
“Friends, tonight the Bodhisattva will leave his home. So you should delight in making offerings to him.
Likewise the four great kings, who had entered the Aḍakavatī Palace, told the great gathering of yakṣas
“Friends, tonight the Bodhisattva will leave his home. You must help him leave by carrying the hooves of his fine horse with your hands.
The gathering of yakṣas responded
“Hard as vajra, and indestructible with a body as powerful as Nārāyaṇa’s, Diligent and strong, this perfect man cannot be moved
Although great Meru, the foremost mountain, may be lifted and held up in the sky, No one can lift the mountain of a victor’s qualities, founded on merit and wisdom.
Vaiśravaṇa said
“Replying to the provincial kings, the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class will respond, ‘May you rule your respective kingdoms according to the Dharma, and not by what is not Dharma
Do not take the lives of living beings
do not take what is not given
and do not engage in sexual misconduct
If from your heart you devote yourself to him with respect
You will find him as light as a tuft of cotton is to birds
“I will walk in front, while you will carry his horse
When the Bodhisattva leaves, we shall gather vast amounts of merit!
Monks, then Śakra, lord of the gods, spoke to the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
“Friends, tonight the Bodhisattva will leave his home. So you should delight in making offerings to him.
Do not let your mind be overcome by covetousness, malice, or misguided beliefs
Do not befriend those who take life or those with misguided beliefs
The god Śāntamati replied
The god Lalitavyūha offered
Should non-Dharma arise in my dominion
do not applaud those who practice it.
In this way the king, who is appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class, will conquer the east
“I will silence all sounds from horses, elephants, donkeys, camels, cows, buffaloes, women, men, boys, and girls.
Then the god Vyūhamati volunteered
“Having conquered the east, the precious wheel will then move toward the eastern seas
“I will cause all men, women, and children in the city of Kapilavastu to fall asleep.
Crossing over them, it will travel magically through space to the south
accompanied by the universal monarch and his four army divisions
As before he will conquer the south
and then move on to conquer the west and the north
“I will construct in midair a fabulous road seven chariots wide, flanked on both sides by jeweled platforms, blazing with the light of sunstone gems, shaded with raised parasols, flags, and banners
strewn with various flowers
and censed from incense burners of various fragrances. On this road the Bodhisattva will set forth.
Then the king of the elephants named Airāvaṇa spoke
“Once the king has conquered the north, the wheel will move toward the northern seas and
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, himself said
I will open the gates and show him the path.
Next the god Dharmacārin said
“I will cause the retinue of consorts to look unappealing.
Then the god Sañcodaka spoke
traveling magically through the sky to the royal palace, it will come to rest unharmed at the entrance to the quarters of the queen’s retinue
“I will help the Bodhisattva to rise from his bed.
In this manner the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious wheel
“How is it that a universal monarch comes to possess the precious elephant
Finally the nāga kings Varuṇa, Manasvin, Sāgara, Anavapta, Nanda, and Upananda spoke
“We, for our part, will produce cloud banks of sandalwood and let a rain of sandalwood powder descend as offerings to the Bodhisattva.
Monks, then all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas set out to do what they had promised
In the meanwhile the Bodhisattva’s mind was on the Dharma
He was resting comfortably in the music hall
surrounded by his ladies
As he reflected on the conduct of past buddhas and the way to benefit all sentient beings
“Previously I wished to become a self-appearing lord and pursue omniscience
The precious elephant of the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class appears in the same way that the precious wheel appeared
Completely white in color
the precious elephant has four limbs, two tusks, and a trunk
Its head is ornamented with gold
and it bears a gold victory banner
Likewise it is bedecked with gold ornaments and covered with gold netting
 Its magical powers enable it to fly through the sky and transform itself
Beings come and go
This king of elephants is known as Bodhi
The world is continually disturbed and is like a tangled mass of cords
“Alas, this world is not at peace because of the self
In this manner the universal monarch comes to possess the precious elephant
“How is it that a universal monarch comes to possess the precious horse
The precious horse of the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class appears just as before
Immediately the Bodhisattva looked around and examined the retinue of consorts
Seeing that they had become repulsive
He thought, “It is true, I live amid a cemetery.
When the Bodhisattva looked at the entire retinue of women
he saw that some had garments that had slipped off, some had disheveled hair, and some had their jewelry in disarray
The precious horse has a blue body and a black head with a braided mane
Others had lost their head ornaments, some had ugly shoulders, while some had uncovered arms and legs
Some had repulsive expressions, while the eyes of others were crossed
It is bridled
Some were drooling, and others were snoring
bearing a gold victory banner and gold ornaments, and it is covered with gold netting
With its magical powers
Some were laughing wildly, some were coughing
and others were prattling incoherently. Some others were gnashing their teeth
and the complexion of others had changed
Some of the women had unpleasant features, such as arms that were too long
Some tossed their feet around
Some had their heads uncovered, while the heads of others were covered
The facial features of some had changed
The bodies of some looked awful
and some were even lying naked
Some, still holding clay kettledrums, were twisting their bodies and heads
Some were hunched over and making gargling sounds
Some of the women held their instruments, such as lutes and three-stringed lutes
Others were grinding their flutes with their teeth
making crushing noises. Some were playing kimpalas, nakalus, and sampas whose resonance boxes had been removed
Some of the women were also lying with their mouths agape
Some had their eyes closed, some had them open, and some were rolling their eyes
The Bodhisattva looked at the retinue of consorts, who were lying there on the floor looking utterly revolting, and he had the impression that he was indeed in a cemetery
On this topic, it is said
Seeing this, the Protector of the World felt upset
With an outpouring of compassion he exclaimed
“Ah! This gathering is so miserable! How could I find delight in this assembly of demonesses
“Flawed and obscured with delusion is the judgment Of he who thinks that worthless sense pleasures are meaningful
Like a bird caught in a cage, One never regains one’s freedom.
Then the Bodhisattva examined his retinue of women by means of this gateway to the light of the Dharma. Next, with words spoken out of great compassion, he lamented sentient beings
“These childish beings are killed, like the condemned at the scaffold
These childish beings are filled with desire
like fools who are attracted to a ceramic vase filled with vomit
These childish beings are drowning
like elephants sinking in deep water
These childish beings are confined
like thieves in a dungeon
These childish beings are content
like a pig surrounded by filth
These childish beings are greedy, like a dog with a bone
These childish beings fall, like moths flying into the candle flame
These childish beings are trapped, like a monkey tangled in a snare
These childish beings are caught, like fish snarled in a net
These childish beings are cut up, like sheep on a slaughtering log
These childish beings are impaled, like a criminal on the tip of a stake
These childish beings are sinking, like an old elephant in a swamp
These childish beings perish, like a ship wrecked on the ocean
These childish beings fall, like a blind person tumbling into a deep abyss
These childish beings are exhausted, like water running into the surface of the earth
These childish beings go up in smoke, like this great earth at the end of the eon
These childish beings are spinning, like the revolving of a potter’s wheel
These childish beings have lost their way, like blind people roaming the mountains
These childish beings are tied up and run in circles, like dogs kept on a leash
These childish beings wither, like grasses and trees in the hot season
These childish beings diminish, like the waning moon during the dark fortnight
These childish beings are devoured, like snakes by the garuḍas
These childish beings are swallowed, like ships by huge sea monsters
These childish beings are robbed, like a traveler by a horde of thieves
it can fly through the sky and transform itself. This king of horses is known as Bālāhaka
These childish beings are broken, like palm trees in a storm
These childish beings are killed, like someone bitten by a poisonous snake
like fools licking a knife smeared with honey
These childish beings are carried away, like wooden logs taken off by the river
These childish beings play, like children toying with their own excrement
These childish beings are controlled, like elephants by the mahout’s hook
These childish beings are deceived, like a simple-minded person by a charlatan
These childish beings exhaust their roots of virtue, like a gambler losing his wealth
These childish beings are devoured, like merchants consumed by demonesses.
The Bodhisattva examined the retinue of consorts by means of these thirty-two similes
At that moment he exclaimed the following verses
He saw that the body, from the soles of the feet all the way up to the top of the head, is made of filth, produces filth, and emits filth
He contemplated the impure nature of the body and developed a feeling of repulsion, and then disgust
“Grown in the fields of karma and born from the water of craving, we call it the transitory body
“How is it that a universal monarch comes to possess the precious jewel
This body is moist from tears, sweat, and mucus, and filled with urine and blood
It is a lapis lazuli gem of pure blue color
with eight facets and very fine craftsmanship
“It is made of bones, teeth, and hair, and is covered by a hairy skin
With the light emitted from the precious jewel, the entirety of the female quarters are bathed in light
“When the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class wishes to examine the precious jewel
It is full of all kinds of filth, fat, pus, and brains; It constantly leaks excrement and it stinks
Packed with intestines, liver, spleen, lymph, and saliva, it is weak
It is like a machine held together by bones and sinew and adorned with flesh
The people who dwell in the vicinity of the precious jewel will be illuminated by its radiance
It is filled with diseases, subject to pain, and always afflicted by hunger and thirst
Seeing and recognizing each other, they will say to one another
‘Wake up, friends
Start your work and get to the market
The sun is up and the day has begun.
In this manner the universal monarch appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious jewel
“The body of beings has many cavities and transforms into old age and death
Seeing the body, what wise person would not think of it as an enemy?
“How is it that the universal monarch appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious wife
The precious wife of the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class appears just as before
The gods, who were hovering in the sky above, asked the god Dharmacārin, “Dear friend, what is this? Siddhārtha dawdles and keeps looking at the retinue of consorts
In accord with tradition, the precious wife has been born into the warrior class. She is not too tall or short, too fat or thin, too dark or fair
ndeed she is beautiful in form, pleasant in manner, and pleasing to the eye
She is in the full bloom of life, and every pore of her body gives off the scent of sandalwood
Monks, indeed the Bodhisattva had become certain
while from her mouth wafts the fragrance of utpala flowers
Her body is as soft to the touch as kācilindika cloth
in cold weather her body is warm to the touch
and in warm weather it is cool
He even smiles and does not seem displeased
Her mind, let alone her body, desires no one other than the universal monarch
But perhaps he is like a deep ocean that cannot be fathomed
In this manner the universal monarch comes to possess the precious wife
Or will he perhaps forget the promise he made when he was inspired by the gods?
Because isn’t it true that whoever is unattached does not cling to objects
The god Dharmacārin replied
“Why say something like that
“How is it that the universal monarch appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious steward
The precious steward of the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class appears just as before
There is surely evidence that when he practiced awakened conduct in the past
Learned, lucid, and intelligent
In twelve years’ time, the Bodhisattva will enter the womb of his mother.
When he looked up into the expanse of space, he saw Indra, the one-thousand-eyed lord of the gods, with a retinue of one hundred thousand gods
Bowing before him, Indra paid his respect to the Bodhisattva
he will become the teacher of gods and humans.
Puṣya, the chief of all constellations, was also seen standing by
and without relying on anyone else as a guide
Relinquishing the attachment of desire
Seeing that it was now midnight, the Bodhisattva called upon Chanda
“All the auspicious signs have come together
Without a doubt I will accomplish my wishes tonight
Chanda, don’t vacillate or delay
Without resorting to punishment or acts of violence, the king will rule with the Dharma, bringing peace and order to the entire vast kingdom that extends all the way to the oceans
Brave, heroic, and supremely able in body, these sons will attain nothing but victory over the forces that oppose them
The universal monarch thus possesses these seven treasures. “The universal monarch will also have one thousand sons
Ornament the king of horses and bring it bedecked to me.
When Chanda heard these words
“Chanda, tell me, for what purpose then Have I in the past forsaken my arms and legs and eyes
The Bodhisattva replied
Your splendor is like that of the sun, or well-purified gold; It is like the newly risen and stainless moon, “Like the fire whose flames are fed by the sacrificial butter. Your splendor is like a blazing flash of lightning
The precious minister is learned, lucid, and intelligent
The precious minister of a king who has been properly consecrated by sprinkling his head appears just as before
In this manner the universal monarch comes to possess the precious steward
I have given up my head and my beloved wife and children, My kingdom, wealth, gold, and clothes, “Elephants and horses laden with jewels, Swift as the wind and of great power
For trillions of eons I have trained in discipline and patience, Delighting in diligence, the powers, concentration, and knowledge
“Therefore, once I attain the auspicious peace of awakening, The time has come for me to free beings drowning in the ocean of old age and death.
With those treasures that do not belong to anyone, he will cater to the material needs of the universal monarch
“The kingdom is prosperous, large, and peaceful, with excellent harvests
It is delightful and filled with many people
They take up the harshest of austerities because, as they say, they wish to attain the best among gods and humans
But you, Lord, you already possess this good fortune
They take pleasure in torturing their bodies and go through various difficult torments
He will satisfy beings with the water of the Dharma.
Then he will attain awakening, the state free from old age and death
He will abandon his retinue of consorts and leave his home
“ ‘However, if he is confronted with the miseries of this world
And he will possess the seven treasures
He will become a universal monarch, ruling over the four continents
Your parks are the best of the best, full of flowers and fruits and resounding with the singing of birds
There are beautiful ponds with blue, pink, and white lotus flowers
and they resound with the cries of swans, peacocks, cuckoos, wild ducks, storks, and whooper swans
There are many flowering trees growing around the lakes, such as mango, aśoka, campaka, amaranth, and saffron trees
The parks are adorned with groves of jeweled trees that are arranged like chessboards and surrounded by jewel platforms
But the Bodhisattva replied
“Enough, Chanda
These sense pleasures are impermanent and unstable
They do not endure and are subject to change
Like the rapids of a mountain torrent, they quickly pass and are turbulent
Like dewdrops, they do not last
Like an empty fist that tricks a child, they have no substance
Like the core of a plantain tree, they have no strength
Like a vase of unbaked clay, they naturally break
Like autumn clouds, they appear one moment and vanish the next
Like a flash of lightning in the sky, they last for just the briefest time
Like a vessel filled with poison, they cause pain
Like poison ivy, they bring discomfort
“The objects of desire, which are desperately craved by all those with immature minds, are like water bubbles, always changing
Like a mirage, they are caused by mistaken perception
They are like a hallucination that has come about through false thinking
Just like dreams, they cannot satisfy, since one is grasping at a false appearance
Just as it is difficult to fill the oceans, desires can never be fulfilled. Like salty water, objects of desire only make you thirstier
And why, monks, did the Bodhisattva examine the continent of his birth
“I want, my lord, to be unharmed by old age
To be healthy and without disease; And to have infinite life without death ever coming.
When the king heard these words, he felt extremely sad
“My son, you are asking for the impossible; I am powerless here
“My lord, if you cannot give me these four boons— Freedom from misfortune and the terrors of sickness, old age, and dying— Then I request of you another boon. Please listen, Your Majesty
There are many of us in the Śākya clan
and he is alone
He will not be able to leave home.
Thereafter the Śākyas and King Śuddhodana placed five hundred young men by the eastern city gate to guard the Bodhisattva. All the men were armed, trained in combat, skilled in archery and javelin throwing, and were as strong as powerful wrestlers
Rather a bodhisattva is born in a central land
May I apply the medicine of the three gateways to liberation—the remedy that employs means, wisdom, and knowledge
May I show them the Dharma of tranquility, which brings fulfillment through knowledge.
The gods who have great magical powers Spoke to the One with Elongated Eyes like a Blooming Lotus
he developed this kind of detachment
Why then would he all of a sudden become attached in this existence, which is his last?
In what mother’s womb will he be conceived?
“Into what precious family will the Bodhisattva be born
Monks, the gods and bodhisattvas then asked one another
Like the head of a viper, they are dangerous to touch
One sees jeweled lattices hanging everywhere
The parks can be enjoyed during any season, and they are pleasant to visit whether it is the hot season, the rainy season, autumn, or winter
They are adorned with verandas, arches, portals, windows, cooling terraces, and top-floor terraces
“Your retinue of consorts is well trained
Then Chanda, wailing as if in sharp pain
with tearful eyes and stricken with agony, exclaimed the following verses
“And you, my Lord, are still young. You are in the prime of your life
We can always leave our homes later, once we are old.
the clever ones deplore them
the noble ones abhor them
Because a bodhisattva is not born in outlying lands where people are as stupid as sheep, with dull faculties, ignorant, and incapable of distinguishing right from wrong
They drop them like a filthy vessel filled with excrement
Because a bodhisattva is not born into an inferior family, like a family of outcastes, flutemakers, cartwrights, or servants
Chanda, since I understand that sense pleasures Destroy all virtue, I do not enjoy them.
A bodhisattva is only born into one of two families—a priestly family or a family of the ruling class
Thus, monks, at this time the ruling-class families were dominant in the world
so bodhisattvas were born into such families
“These ladies are well trained in offering pleasures, In combination with song and the melodious sounds of lutes and reed pipes
Enjoy these pleasures, my Lord! If you do not leave, you will experience great delights!
The Bodhisattva answered
Having examined these points, he remained silent
In previous births I have endured hundreds of sufferings— Imprisonment, slavery, beatings, threats—all on account of desire. While my mind was fixed on conditioned things, I could not gain liberation
Accompanied by the sounds of partridge, peacocks, and cuckoos
Are you going to abandon this place, which is like a city of kiṃnaras
Some said, “The Vaideha family in the land of Magadha is wealthy, prosperous, and happy
The family’s fortunes have come about from little merit, not a vast store of merit. They are impetuous, unstable, and fickle
The surrounding environs of their land are like a desert, with few groves, lakes, and ponds. This is a primitive land, like a remote village
The Bodhisattva replied
The family of the king of Vatsa is base, violent, and lacking in nobility
They are illegitimate by birth, and their accomplishments have not resulted from the noble deeds of their parents
Some said, “The family of the king of Vatsa is wealthy, prosperous, and happy
This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.” To this, others replied, “This is not a worthy place
“Chanda, for countless eons beyond measure I have enjoyed the many sense pleasures of humans and gods, In the manner of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, Yet I have failed to become satisfied
This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.” “This is not a worthy place, either,” others replied
“The Kośala family descends from outcastes. Neither the father’s nor the mother’s families are pure
“I have been a supreme royal son, so rich in power! I have been a universal monarch, ruling over the four continents
I possessed the seven treasures, And I lived in the midst of ladies
Their interests are base and their line is ignoble
“I ruled over the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and the Heaven Free from Strife; I left those realms and came here
In the past I enjoyed the most sacred and superb objects Among the gods of emanations
Moreover, they have no limitless store of wealth and treasures. Hence this is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to take birth.
“I have been the lord of demons, who controls the realms of gods; I have enjoyed the best and most exquisite sense pleasures, but found no satisfaction
How then would I find satisfaction now by indulging in inferior pleasures? This is out of the question
“Here are many flowers, such as jasmine, blue lotuses, coral jasmine, and campakas, And fragrant garlands with masses of fine blossoms
We have perfectly scented incense made of black aloeswood, And sublime scented ointments. Do you not see all of this
Then later, Noble Lord of the Śākyas, you can retreat to the forest!
Delightful and teeming with people
Now, enjoy and revel in them with delight and bliss
“Here are the five sense pleasures, As exquisite as the divine pleasures in the god realms
You have beautiful, fine silken clothing; Do you not see them, my Lord? Where will you go
“Here your garments are scented in the cold season with warming oils, And in the hot season, with sandalwood
it is like a heavenly palace, with terraces, balconies, architraves, skylights, cool pavilions, multistoried buildings, and palaces
This city is filled with blooming flowers, ringed with gardens, and encircled by forests
“Here you get the finest cuisine and the best dishes, With exquisite flavors, emitting superb aromas, Along with the sweetest beverages
“They do not speak to one another with decorum
nor do they respect their superiors, elders, leaders, or those in between
Each thinks that he is king, never taking on the role of a student or accepting the Dharma
I will strive to benefit and liberate beings
“Chanda, listen to this about my resolve
“Lord, is your resolve based on conviction?
At that time Chanda, who now cried even harder, exclaimed
I will establish them on the auspicious dry land without old age or death.
They have emerged victorious in battle over their foes. This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.
Once I have ferried innumerable beings across
I would never want to be a householder again!
And an erupting volcano were to drop on my head
“Even if bolts of lightning, battle-axes, spears, and arrows were to rain upon me, And if molten iron, blazing like a fork of lightning
Chanda then asked
“Lord, how can you be so certain?
My resolve is like a mountain: immutable, unchangeable, and firm. It is as difficult to move as Meru, the king of mountains.
The Bodhisattva replied
They made everything plunge into deep silence
Monks, at that moment the Bodhisattva realized that everyone in the city was sound asleep
that the hour of midnight had come
“Chanda, don’t badger me now. Instead, without any further delay, bring me my horse Kaṇṭhaka, well adorned.
As soon as the Bodhisattva uttered these words
the four great kings left their residences
Indeed he is like a savage, so it is inappropriate for the Bodhisattva to take his final existence in a family with wrong views
Just like a lotus rising up from the water.
The Pure Being is unstained by pleasurable objects
The mind of the Supreme Being remains unattached
“Like the sky, which remains unattached to darkness, dust, smoke, or comets
You are the protector who grants fearlessness to beings
May you, the one with supreme intelligence, be victorious
They are uncivilized, wild, and impetuous, without any heed for the consequences of their actions. Hence this is not an appropriate place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.
Monks, when Chanda heard the Bodhisattva’s words
his eyes became filled with tears and he said
“Lord, you know the right time, the right moment, and the right occasion
However, this is not the right time and not the occasion to leave
“Chanda, the time has come.
And stood before the noblest of men
Transformed his body in a majestic way
The constellation Puṣya as well, with his retinue
Moon and Sun, these two gods, Came to stand to his right and left
They joined their palms together And reflected on the Bodhisattva’s departure
He held a blazing vajra in his hand
The great being who is lord of the guhyakas, Pradīptavajra, positioned himself in the sky above
Wearing armor, strong, brave, and energetic
They were in a hurry to make offerings to the Supreme Being, Who is worthy of honor in all the three realms
The gods in the form realm also came, Those who always experience the peace of concentration
Also the bodhisattvas, who were his companions in past actions, Gathered there from all ten directions, saying
“Now that Puṣya is present, this is the perfect time to leave
Tonight all your virtuous and auspicious prayers will be fulfilled
Now swiftly manifest your strength and courage
And liberate all beings who are oppressed by misery
Now is the right time for you to leave!
Billions of gods had gathered And let a rain of ravishing flowers fall down
The Bodhisattva, for his part, sat there in the perfect cross-legged posture; Surrounded by gods, he was so beautiful, blazing with splendor
In the city, all men, women, and children Became tired and fell asleep, abandoning their chores
The horses, elephants, oxen, parrots, cranes, peacocks, and mynas Became tired and quickly slept, not noticing anything
Armed with lances hard as vajra, and mounted on elephants, horses, and chariots, The Śākya youths who kept guard also fell asleep, As did the king, the princes, and the royal pages
The retinue of consorts, completely naked, were asleep and oblivious
As midnight arrived, the Bodhisattva spoke to Chanda In a voice captivating like Brahmā’s and sweet as a nightingale
Chanda’s eyes filled with tears as he spoke to his master‌
“Great Charioteer, where will you go? What do you need the horse for
You know the right time and moment, and this is not the time to practice the Dharma
The gates are shut and firmly bolted, so who will open them for you?
Right then Śakra opened the gate merely by the power of his mind
Chanda was thrilled at the sight, yet also sad and on the verge of tears
Śakra will only listen to the one with such invincible power
“What use is this powerful army with its four divisions
The king, the princes, and the royal pages—none of them know what the Bodhisattva is doing
Yaśovatī and the retinue of consorts are in their beds, lulled to sleep by the gods
Alas! He is leaving. The vow he made in the past is now being fulfilled!
The gods and demigods play their millions of drums and instruments
And still this supreme city that the gods have put to sleep does not awake
“Chanda, look to the pure sky where a divine light shines so beautifully
Look at the millions of assembled bodhisattvas making offerings
Chanda heard the gods and told the horse Kaṇṭhaka
“You must neigh now, because here comes the supreme charioteer of beings!
Then he adorned the horse’s jasmine-colored hoofs with gold
It is populous, filled with people
Distressed and weeping, he gave the horse to He Who Is an Ocean of Qualities, saying
 The royal palace of King Subāhu, who commands an army of brave warriors, is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.
“You with noble marks who benefits others, here is your horse of virtuous pedigree
May you grant all beings happiness, rebirth in the higher realms, and peace!
He mounted the supreme king of horses that resembled the full moon
The guardians, with their pure lotus-like hands, then lifted up the supreme horse
Śakra and Brahmā went in the front, showing the way
The pure and bright light sent forth by the Bodhisattva illumined the earth
The lower realms were pacified, and all beings were happy and free from afflictions
A rain of flowers fell, millions of instruments sounded, and gods and demigods rejoiced
All of them circumambulated the city and departed filled with delight
Since the Great Being was leaving, the deity of the best of cities came, feeling depressed
Appearing before the Bodhisattva, the deity spoke to his lotus face, feeling miserable and dejected
“If you leave, the city will become disturbed and steeped in darkness
If tonight you abandon your palace, there will be no joy and no happiness for me
This is a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.” “This is not a worthy place, either,” others replied
Hence this as well is not an appropriate place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.
Some suggested, “The king of the city of Hastināpura was born in the family descended from Pāṇḍu
I will not return to the city of Kapilavastu
The Intelligent One looked at the palace And spoke in the sweetest voice
“Until I have made an end to birth and death
And take one more look at this palace!
Yet please engender love and compassion
This king is brave, courageous, and handsome. He has conquered opposing armies
“You will take away the vitality and power from this entire city
Like a wasteland, it will shine with beauty no more
Today, disproved are the sages’ prophecies That you will be a universal monarch on earth
When the Bodhisattva, the Lord of Beings, departed
The celestial maidens traveling through the sky began to sing his praise
“He is the marvelous object of offering and a great field of merit, The field for those wishing for merit, and the giver of the fruit of immortality
“Out of compassion for sentient beings
They say that Yudhiṣṭhira is the son of Dharma
he has throughout ten million eons Trained in generosity, self-control, and restraint, and thus attained awakening
that Bhīmasena is the son of Vāyu
His discipline is pure, his conduct excellent, and his practice undiminished
that Arjuna is the son of Indra
He did not pursue pleasures and enjoyments, but observed discipline
and that Nakula and Sahadeva are the sons of the two Aśvins
“He always spoke patiently to protect others; Even when his limbs were cut off, he was never angry or hostile
Constantly diligent for millions of eons, he never felt disheartened
Thus he has awakened and performed millions of sacrifices
“Always in meditative concentration
his mind has become calm and tranquil
Since he has burned away all emotions, he will liberate millions of beings
He possesses unobstructed knowledge and is free from conceptual thinking
With a mind free from conceptuality, he will become a self-arising victor
Hence it is not proper for the Bodhisattva to be conceived in this family.
He possesses joy, equanimity, concentration, and knows the four immeasurables
He is the supreme god of gods
Some said, “The city of Mithilā is extremely beautiful and prosperous. This is the land ruled by King Sumitra
who has many elephants, horses, chariots, infantry, and troops
He also has great material wealth, with great stores of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, beryl, conches, crystals, corals, fine gold, and many other riches and belongings
He is powerful, with an army unafraid of the kings from surrounding lands
He is like a king, a righteous king, like Śakra with a thousand eyes
He has many friends, and he delights in the Dharma
and a physician for those long sick
Like the self-arisen Brahmā, pure in body and mind
This family is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived.
“He is firm with abundant knowledge, diligent and detached
He is a hero because he destroyed the afflictions; undefeated, he conquers all enemies
Those born into the Pāṇḍava family have confused their genealogy
He is fearless like a lion and gentle like an elephant
He is the leader of the herd like a perfect bull, always patient and without anger
“He is bright like the moon and illuminating like the sun
Thus it is fitting for the Bodhisattva to be conceived in this family.” To this, others responded, “This family is also not worthy of the Bodhisattva
He shines like a torch and glows like a star
He is unstained like a lotus, and his discipline smells sweet like a flower
This teacher is immovable like Mount Meru and provides sustenance like the earth
He is unshakable like an ocean
Moreover, he already has many sons. It is not proper for the Bodhisattva to be conceived in this family.
At the place where Chanda left the Bodhisattva in order to return home, a memorial was later built
“Chanda, you should go back now
Take these ornaments and my horse Kaṇṭhaka and return to the palace.
So he summoned Chanda and told him
“I should entrust these ornaments and the horse Kaṇṭhaka to Chanda, and then send him back.
They had listened to the Bodhisattva’s words and had prepared to make offerings to him. Now they hurried quickly to the city of Kapilavastu
King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, lord of the gandharvas, arrived from the east together with several trillion kiṃnaras playing various instruments and singing songs
There he dismounted from his horse Kaṇṭhaka and, once he was on the ground, he dismissed the great assembly of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
“With my hair this long, I cannot be a monk.” So he took his sword, cut off his hair, and then cast it into the air
The gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three collected the hair for worship
Even to this day the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three celebrate this event during the Hair Festival
“If I am to be a monk, it would not be right to wear silken garments. So it would be good if I could find some clothes suitable for living in the forest.
“The Bodhisattva needs saffron-colored robes.
Immediately a god left and manifested in front of the Bodhisattva in the form of a hunter wearing saffron-colored cloth
The Bodhisattva asked the god, “My friend
would you give me your saffron-colored robes? Then I will give you my silken garments.
“Your clothes already suit you well
and I am happy with what I wear.
“Please, I beg you.
The god, still in the shape of a hunter, then gave his saffron-colored clothes to the Bodhisattva
while he himself took the Bodhisattva’s silken garments
Because the god was overcome with devotion to the Bodhisattva, he touched the garments to his head, holding them with both of his hands
Then he returned to the celestial world in order to render offerings and veneration to the garments there
Chanda had witnessed the exchange of clothes, and later a memorial was erected at the site
This memorial is still known today as the “Memorial of Receiving the Saffron-Colored Cloth.
At this very place another memorial was built, which today is still known as “Receipt of the Hair.
Again the Bodhisattva considered
When the Bodhisattva cut off his hair and put on the saffron-colored cloth
one hundred thousand gods felt joyous, pleased, and elated
Happy and delighted, they called out cries of joy and exclaimed
“Friends, Prince Siddhārtha has left his home
He will awaken to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood and will turn the wheel of the Dharma
He will liberate from birth the infinite number of beings who are born
When the retinue of consorts did not see the young prince
for it leads to the pure teaching of the Dharma
for it leads to the pure teaching of the Dharma
The ladies were overcome by extreme grief, and some cried out, “My son!” Others called out “My brother!” “My husband!” “My lord!” and “My master!
Some mumbled different tender words, while others contorted their bodies in various ways and wept
Some of the ladies plucked their hair, while others faced each other and sobbed
Some cried with rolling eyes
However, right then they saw Chanda trailing behind the god, leading the horse Kaṇṭhaka and carrying the Bodhisattva’s ornaments
Acceptance of nonarising is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
or it leads to the actualization of cessation
“Quickly close the city gates! Let us search for the prince within the gates!
The Śākyas looked into the matter and replied

When the king heard these noises, he asked his fellow Śākyas
Recollection of the Buddha is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it leads to the pure perception of the Buddha

“What is this loud noise coming from the ladies’ apartments?
Others collapsed suddenly on the ground, like a tree that has been cut from its root, and wept
while some writhed on the ground, as if they were fish pulled from water, and cried
or it leads to physical isolation
Others tossed their bodies around on the floor, as if they were just about to die
Some among them staggered about like a plantain tree shaken by the wind and sobbed
for it stops one from transgressing the rules
for it leads to the cessation of all sensations

for it leads to the fulfillment of aspirations
The king then sent messengers on horseback into the four directions with the order

for it leads to a vast mindset

for it eliminates overt fixation on the self

“Chanda, did this man kill the prince for the sake of his silken garments?
for it dampens the flames of passion
Chanda replied

“No, not at all

for it brings complete peace in others

The men questioned Chanda further
Acknowledging the kindness of others is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it ensures that the basic virtues one has engaged in do not go to wast
“What do you think, Chanda
Gratitude is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Should we go after the prince? Will we be able to make him return?
Recollection of the Saṅgha is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Chanda replied, “No, you will not be able to do so
The young prince is so diligent, disciplined, and steadfast
He said that unless he awakens to perfect and complete buddhahood, he will never again enter the city of Kapilavastu. So he will not return with you
Then Chanda took the horse Kaṇṭhaka and the ornaments and went to the inner quarters
The entire city of Kapilavastu awoke from its sleep
for they lead to lightness of body and mind
When the wise and courageous Bodhisattva departed from his home
On this topic, it is said
The faculty of faith is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
and even to this day that lake is called the Lake of the Ornaments
So she let the ornaments be thrown into the pond
I think it is better therefore to throw the ornaments into the pond.
for it leads one to not depend on the guidance of others
for it endows one with the wisdom of realization
They must have many male servants, female servants, officials, and workers
for it leads one to engage in wholesome deeds
“When I see his ornaments lying there, my heart is pierced with pain
This family must be difficult to defeat
It must accomplish all of its aims
for it leads to the liberation of mind
for it leads to the wisdom of direct perception
Friends, the family of a bodhisattva in his final existence must have these sixty-four qualities
“Friends, the woman in whose womb a bodhisattva is conceived in his final existence must have thirty-two qualities
When Gopā and the assembly of consorts awoke
They looked at his bed but did not find the Bodhisattva there
When the king heard that, he collapsed on the ground
She must be generous, cheerful, and adroit
for it leads to the thorough transcendence of the power of Māra

As soon as Dhṛtarāṣṭra arrived, he began to circumambulate the city of Kapilavastu. Stopping in the east, from where he had arrived, he paid homage to the Bodhisattva
for with it one will relinquish all discursive thinking
He wept and cried, “Oh no, my only son!
Many hundreds of Śākyas tried to revive him, Sprinkling water from vases on him as he lay motionless
Gopā had also fallen off her bed and onto the ground
She cut her hair and took off her jewelry
for with it one will not be easily deceived
for it enables one to understand the Dharma as it is
He gave his fine horse and his ornaments to Chanda and said
Traveled six leagues during the remainder of the night
The Great Sage, who is well trained in thousands of virtues
for it enables one to accomplish all Dharmas. The aspect of awakening of complete diligence is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Alas, the spaces covered with golden nets
Alas, the assembly of consorts with fine jewelry
All this I shall see no more without him, who is so full of qualities.
for it endows one with the intelligence of perfect realization
“Alas, the delightful singing voices
The palace has lost its beauty and the city has become like a desert
Since the most noble being has left this fine city
I shall sleep on the ground and wear my matted hair in a topknot; Without bathing, I shall practice disciplined conduct and austerities
I will not drink water, nor mead or liquor
When you left my bed, where did you go
“Until I see the Bodhisattva with all his good qualities again
Praised as he who brings good fortune, you are honored in heaven and on earth
“Your form is so beautiful; your faultless limbs are perfect. So brilliant and pure; all beings cherish you
The aspect of awakening of complete joy is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
She exclaimed, “Before long we must separate from those we love! The Guide of Beings told me that; he made me so perfectly aware of this
“Chanda, take these and return to the city of Kapilavastu
“Repeat the following to my parents
for it enables one to accomplish absorption
Chanda began to weep and spoke again to the Guide
The Bodhisattva told me in a soft and gentle voice
At night, when the old and young in this city were deeply asleep
Chanda replied, “Powerful king, listen to me
How did the gods make offerings to him?
Who opened the gate for him, who led him away
Where did the Bodhisattva go, and what are his plans
Where have you gone, abandoning this kingdom
“Alas, my son, so talented in playing music and singing songs
or it enables one to accomplish one’s endeavors
He cried out and collapsed on the ground
When the king saw only the horse Kaṇṭhaka and Chanda
The Bodhisattva replied, “Chanda, do not be afraid
My kinfolk will be happy to see you again
They will always regard you as their teacher And love you in the same way as they loved me.
for it leads to distaste for all births
Bringing the finest of horses and the ornaments, Chanda returned to the park of the noble one among men
The guard at the park, overjoyed upon seeing them, Speedily conveyed the happy news to the Śākyas
“The prince, the noble horse, as well as Chanda
Have returned to the park, so don’t worry anymore.
When the king, who was surrounded by the retinue of Śākyas, heard this
for it prevents one from transgressing the rules
He became exhilarated and quickly went to the park
But Gopā, knowing the intelligence and steadfastness of the Bodhisattva
Was not thrilled, and did not trust these words
‘Chanda, quickly bring me the king of horses.
“I tried to wake up the assembly of men and ladies
But they were so sound asleep that they did not hear my words
Right resolve is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for it leads one to relinquish all thoughts, concepts, and ideas
Right speech is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Alas, my gentle love with a voice as sweet as Brahmā’s And as soft as the sound of a nightingale
“Alas, my powerful man, who is as strong as Nārāyaṇa, You conquer the hordes of demons
Alas, my lord full of supreme qualities, Venerated by humans and gods alike and full of great compassion
“Alas, my wellborn man with a perfect body, Well formed and tapering, you are unequaled
Alas, my most noble of men! Alas, you with excellent marks, so stainless and splendid
“Alas, you gave me joy! Alas, noble man whose face is like the spotless moon
She was overcome by sorrow and cried out
Recalling the games of love from the past
The dejected princess of the Śākyas gathered her strength And embraced the neck of the noble king of horses
for it leads one to realize that all words, sounds, language, and speech are like echoes
for it leads to the absence of karma and the absence of ripening
Then Chanda took the noble horse and the ornaments with him And went into the ladies’ quarters, weeping
The gods and goddesses offered him praises As he moved through the sky surrounded by a celestial retinue.
Flowers fell, and the sound of hundreds of musical instruments was heard
“A bright light appeared, which dispelled the pitch-black darkness
The road on which he traveled through the sky was very broad indeed
When the hero mounted the horse, the trichiliocosm shook
The guardians of the world tightly held the horse’s hoofs
“Śakra opened the gates that were fitted with a lock
“Alas, my man of limitless renown, You have emerged from hundreds of virtues and have stainless merit
for it leads one to cease all pursuits
Alas, you are my love with glory beyond limits! Adorned with good qualities, you delight the sages
“Alas, my handsome love, who was born in the sublime forest of Lumbini, Which resounds with the buzzing of bees
Alas, my dear one, renowned in heaven and on earth, You who are a revered tree of wisdom
for it leads one to reach the other shore
“Alas, my sweet-tasting man, with lips like the bimba fruit, With eyes like a lotus and skin of golden hue
Right mindfulness is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Alas, my dear one with spotless teeth, As white as cow’s milk or snow
Alas, my dear one with shoulders so well formed, With a waist like a bow, legs like a deer, and rounded hips
“Alas, my man with thighs like the trunk of an elephant, With fair hands and feet, and with copper-colored nails
All these beautiful attributes were formed by your merit And delighted the king
“Alas, you were my melodious song and music, And a balm obtained from exquisite flowers in the best of seasons
Alas, you were to me the scent of flowers; You brought delight to the retinue of consorts with song and music
“Alas, fine Kaṇṭhaka, my husband’s companion! Where did you carry him
for it leads to the absence of mindlessness and mental engagements
Alas, Chanda, don’t you have any compassion? Why did you not wake us when the best of men was leaving
“Today the compassionate guide Of those who need guidance has left this noble city
for it leads to the attainment of the absorption of an undisturbed mind
“How did our benefactor leave? And who helped him escape from the capital
In which direction has he gone? Fortunate are the deities of the forest groves who are now his companions
for it ensures the continuity of the line of the Three Jewels
“Chanda, I am miserable, for I had been showed a treasure. Yet now, since it is like my eyes have been gouged, restore my sight
Chanda, the victorious ones always teach That one’s parents are to be honored
“If he abandoned them, needless to mention That he would leave the pleasures of love with a woman
Alas, to separate from those we love Is like watching a play—nothing endures
Superior intention is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it leads to a distinct focus on the vast Buddhadharma
for it leads to the perfection of all virtuous qualities
for it leads to the sublime marks and signs, to the complete purity of the buddha realms, and to the thorough ripening of those sentient beings that are greedy
for it enables one to transcend all the restricted and lower states of existence and to ripen  those sentient beings with lax discipline
for it enables one to relinquish malice, aggression, anger, pride, arrogance, and conceit, and to ripen those sentient beings that harbor malice
for it enables one to practice all virtuous endeavors and to ripen those sentient beings that are lazy
The perfection of concentration is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
“Because of grasping at concepts, childish beings hold mistaken views; This is why they have to take birth and die
In the past he taught that all who are conditioned by birth and death Have no friends whatsoever
“So may his wishes be fulfilled and may he, Under the best of trees, attain supreme and noble awakening
When he has attained stainless awakening, May he return to this noble city!
When Chanda heard Gopā’s words, He felt deeply unhappy
He said in a voice choked with tears, “Gopā, listen to my words
“When I heard his words, I immediately looked at you, asleep on your bed
And I shouted aloud to you, Gopā, ‘Your beloved is about to leave, get up!
“Kaṇṭhaka then neighed with his fierce energy, And although the sound could be heard for a mile
Nobody in our fine city heard it, Having been lulled to sleep by the gods
“As the hooves of Kaṇṭhaka— Covered with gold, silver, and precious gems—struck the earth
for it enables one to give rise to all states of equipoise and superknowledge and to ripen those sentient beings that are distracted
The earth gave off a terrible and beautiful sound, And yet nobody could hear it
“At that time the constellation of Puṣya had arisen, And the moon and the stars were shining in the sky
From the sky tens of millions of gods folded their hands, Bowed to him, and offered prostrations
“With the assembly of yakṣas and rākṣasas in attendance, The four guardians of the world, who possess great magical power
Lifted the hooves of Kaṇṭhaka with their hands That were as spotless and pure as the anthers of a lotus flower
“The Lord elevated with hundreds of merits Mounted the horse and resembled a red lotus and a jasmine flower
“Desire is like poison and has endless faults; It pushes beings into hell and the realms of hungry spirits and animals
Please be my friend, and I will give you my entire kingdom. Please enjoy its abundant pleasures. “Please do not stay in the empty forest
“Your Majesty, even if one man were to attain All the pleasures of the gods And everything desirable among humans, It still would not suffice, and he would search for more
“I have abandoned many delights And thousands of women so beautiful to behold. I now wish for the perfect peace of sacred awakening. Since I find no joy in conditioned existence, I have left it.
Monks, the Bodhisattva continued to think
“Once, when I was sitting in my father’s park under the shade of a rose apple tree
The Bodhisattva therefore decided to disregard the words of the gods in order to avoid hypocrisy. Instead he decided to begin eating solid foods
However, if these concerned gods were to grant me nourishment through the pores of my body, I would be the worst of hypocrites.
“Since the path that you walk on today has been swept by the gods
“Trillions of demons, as many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges
Are unable to move you from under the branches of the Bodhi tree, or to shake you
You have made billions of offerings, as many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges
“The planets, the moon, the stars, and the sun may fall from the sky to the ground
The mightiest mountains may move from their places, and oceans may dry up
Some learned person might magically display each of the four elements
Yet it is impossible that you would go to the king of trees and rise before attaining awakening
May I and all my nāga wives and children become free from this existence
Your gait is like the walk of an elephant in rut—may we walk like you!
In this way, as the Bodhisattva proceeded on his way, they besprinkled him with showers of flowers made of various jewels and praised him with these verses
The nāga girls attended to the Bodhisattva while they sang melodious songs accompanied by music
You are not depressed, but intrepid, joyous, and hard to dominate
You are not attached, not angry, not deluded, and without desire
You are dispassionate and liberated. Homage to you, O Great Sage
 “You are a physician who removes pain, and a guide for those who need guidance
You are the supreme physician who liberates beings from sufferin
Considering those without refuge or protection
You have manifested as a home and a refuge in this threefold world
“Since the congregation of gods is pleased and joyful
They cause a great rain of flowers to fall from the sky
Since they toss down plenty of the finest cloth
You will become victorious today. So be joyful
“Approach the lord of trees and sit there without fear
Conquer Māra’s army and become free from the web of disturbing emotions
Just as the victorious lords of the past attained awakening
So you will also attain supreme, sacred, and peaceful awakening
For the sake of liberating beings you have gone through hardship
Now the time has come for your wishes to be fulfilled
So go to the lord of trees and connect with supreme awakening.
Monks, the Bodhisattva then thought to himself
It was as soft to the touch as divine cloth
It coiled to the right and resembled the neck of a peacock
The grass was green, soft, fresh, and beautiful
Monks, at the right side of the road the Bodhisattva now noticed a grass seller, whose name was Svastika, who was busy cutting grass
The previous thus-gone ones used a seat of grass as they attained unsurpassed, genuine and perfect awakening.
 “Yes, that is how it is. Holy Man, that is correct
They sat on a bed of grass!
“For many millions of eons you have aimed for this
At that point hundreds of thousands of gods from the pure realms descended into the atmosphere. They knew the Bodhisattva’s thoughts and said
When I see him meditating with a torch-like luster
My limbs tremble.
for they enable one to teach modes of conduct that accord with the interests of sentient beings and to practice all the teachings of the Buddha
The four ways of attracting students are gateways to the light of the Dharma
Most of the Śākya boys went outside
Chanda, surrounded by the other boys, said, “Young Prince, come on! Let’s go and take a look at the forest
What use is staying in the house like a priest
Come on, let’s go call on some girls.
In summer, the first month after spring, When flowers were covered in buds and blooming
When cranes, peacocks, parrots, and myna birds were singing
“Yes! The eminent sages speak eloquently and truthfully; The boy will surely leave home for the sake of awakening.
Taking off his crown, sword, and shoes, The king made salutations to the prince with his palms joined above his head
“Your Majesty! The Supreme One has gone to a farming village.
“Has anyone seen my son go out?” Then someone said
Many thousands of gods, with palms joined, Bowed down to the feet of this resolute child
Śuddhodana, searching all around his quarters
asked, “Where has my son gone?
 His maternal aunt said, “I have searched but did not find him
Your Majesty, please find out where the boy has gone.
Śuddhodana frantically asked his attendants, The doormen, and everyone else in the inner quarters
Though the sun shifted, its shade did not leave the Bliss-Gone One
The supreme tree bowed down like a lotus leaf
Twelve hundred gods with supreme devotion, As well as five hundred Śākya boys, approached
Seeing the miraculous power of the Bliss-Gone One with his ocean of qualities
They firmly engendered the intent set on supreme awakening
Shaking the ground of the entire trichiliocosm, The Bodhisattva arose from his absorption with mindfulness and introspection
The Resplendent One then said to his father in the voice of Brahmā
“O Father, relinquish your fields and seek no further
If it’s garments that you seek, I will offer you garments
If it’s grain that you seek, I will shower down a rain of grain
Your Majesty, please apply this genuinely to everyone!
Once he had instructed his father and those in the retinue, He instantly returned to the supreme city
This concludes the eleventh chapter, on the farming village
Yet if he does not renounce the household, he will become a universal monarch, a righteous Dharma king who has conquered the four quarters and is equipped with the seven treasures
he will become a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a completely perfect buddha
for they gather sentient beings and turn them into suitable recipients for the Dharma that comes from the discovery of awakening
“I will give you an answer in seven days.
Like fire and like the blade of a sword
“Sensual objects are not alluring to me
Nor am I attracted when among a crowd of women
So I ought to dwell silently in the forest, With a mind stilled by the bliss of concentrated absorption.
“If we are to do such a thing, then you should determine which girl would be a suitable match for the prince.
King Śuddhodana then said to the assembly
Therefore we must arrange a marriage for the prince
Once he is surrounded by a group of women
he will discover pleasure and not renounce the household
He will have one thousand sons, all of them full, fierce warriors with well-built bodies that destroy the armies of the enemy
Monks, with this purpose in mind, the Bodhisattva went to see Rudraka, the son of Rāma. When he met Rudraka
And with this, the five ascetic companions left Rudraka, the son of Rāma, to follow the Bodhisattva instead
Whatever he is about to discover, he will probably share it with us.
Yet this mendicant Gautama was able to realize it and manifest it through such little hardship. And now he doesn’t want it
As he was staying there, three parables that he had never previously heard or thought of came to his mind
What were these three
And in this way the people in the villages around me would know that the mendicant Gautama abstains from food
“I took a vow to remain fasting
Monks, I then thought
We can give you nourishment through the pores of your body.
“Holy Man, don’t eat solid food
Monks, at that point some gods felt concern for me
Since they knew my thoughts
they came to where I was staying and told me
Once I do so, I will proceed to the seat of awakening.
At the same time his five companions had also attended him by bringing him the single juniper berry, sesame seed, or rice grain that he ate
Monks, at that point one of Sujātā’s servants, a woman named Rādhā, had just died. She had been wrapped in a hemp cloth and left in the charnel ground. When I saw this dusty rag, I decided to use it to cover myself
Others ran toward the Bodhisattva, carrying trees that had been uprooted
Some had ears like goats, demons, elephants, or pigs, or hanging ears
Others had no ears at all
Some had just one head
Some had misshapen forms
Let’s make sure that he is caught, cut, slashed, tied, held, harassed, cut in pieces, gotten rid of, and destroyed!
They were disfigured and caused terror with their awful faces of foxes, jackals, pigs, donkeys, oxen, elephants, horses, camels, wild asses, buffaloes, rabbits, yaks, rhinos, and the eight-legged lion beast
Some had animal bodies like lions, tigers, wild boars, bears, monkeys, elephants, cats, goats, sheep, snakes, mongooses, fish, crocodiles, alligators, tortoises, ravens, vultures, owls, and garuḍas
Some were so thirsty for blood that they would cut each other’s heads off
Some had swollen bellies and weak bodies, with their bones sticking out. They had broken noses, bellies like barrels, and feet round as balls
for it enables one to not be attached to one’s own happiness and to be free from discouragement
Grasping the true Dharma is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it enables one to eliminate the afflictions of all sentient beings
The accumulation of merit is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Monks, one time, when the prince had grown older, King Śuddhodana was sitting in the meeting hall together with the assembly of Śākyas
There some of the Śākya elders spoke to King Śuddhodana
“Your Majesty
for it enables one to nurture all sentient being
for it perfects the ten powers
The accumulation of calm abiding is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
The prince first reflected in this way. Then, manifesting skillful means, he considered the ripening of sentient beings and engendered intense compassion for them
but others had two or more, some had even up to one hundred thousand
Some had no head at all
Some had just one arm while others had up to one hundred thousand
Others had no arms
Some had just one leg while others had up to one hundred thousand
Others had no legs at all
or it leads to the attainment of the absorption of the thus-gone ones
for it leads to the attainment of the eye of knowledge
for it leads to the attainment of the eye of Dharma
Accessing the trustworthy is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for it leads to the purity of the eye of the Buddha
The attainment of dhāraṇī is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Some had poisonous snakes emerging from their bodily apertures—ears, mouths, noses, eyes, and belly buttons
for it enables one to retain everything said by the Buddha
The attainment of confidence is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it enables one to satisfy all sentient beings by offering them clear explanations
Acceptance of the concordant Dharma is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
They threatened the Bodhisattva as they danced around and brandished their many weapons, such as swords, bows, arrows, darts, tridents, axes, discuses, spears, lances, vajras, javelins, and other sharp weapons
Some of them wore garlands of human fingers that they had cut off and strung together
Others wore on their heads bones, hands, and skulls, which they had strung into garlands, and some had their bodies covered in poisonous snakes
Some were holding skulls and rode on elephants, horses, camels, donkeys, and buffaloes
They were vomiting poisonous snakes, spitting out lumps of iron
spewing fire
and producing a rain of flaming iron and copper
They sent rains consisting of masses of arrows
bringing darkness and causing swishing sounds as they ran toward the Bodhisattva
Some of the soldiers swung their lassos
destroyed great mountains
for it leads to being in accord with the entirety of the Buddhadharma
stirred the vast oceans
jumped over tall mountains
Acceptance of the Dharma of nonarising is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
and shook Meru, the king of mountains
for it leads to the attainment of prophecy
The ground of nonreturning is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it leads to the complete perfection of the entirety of the Buddhadharma
Oh no, my son
Get up
Quick, get up and flee!
Awful forms of demonesses, flesh eaters
and hungry spirits—one-eyed, limping, and with hunger in their eyes—ran toward the Bodhisattva with outstretched hands, distorted faces, and terrifying cries
They were fearful and horrifying
Such an army of demons formed a big gathering, stretching eighty leagues on every side
Many terrifying malevolent spirits approach, With wild matted hair, sheep heads, crooked bones, and goiters
Such are the faces of the approaching army
They have faces like tigers, snakes, and hogs, Elephants, horses, donkeys, and camels, Monkeys, lions, or bears
One, two, three arms, Up to a thousand arms
There are also many with one, two, three legs, Even some with a thousand legs
They have one, two, three heads, Up to a thousand faces
On this topic, it is said
 The wisdom that evolves from ground to ground is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
for it leads to being empowered with the wisdom of omniscience
Forms of yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and mahoragas, As well as rākṣasas, hungry spirits, and flesh eaters, In any form that the world finds ugly and fierce, All have been magically manifested there by these rogues
The ground of empowerment is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
 Some have a blue face and a yellow body
Others have a yellow face and a blue body
Their bodies are drenched with human blood
Such are the malevolent spirits that approach
Their legs are like the legs of an antelope
Their eyeballs look like those of monkeys
The shape of their bodies is that of a crocodile
Their two eyeballs are ablaze
Their ears are like those of a goat
Their fangs look like elephant tusks
Some hold up a staff in their hands
Others brandish hammers, clubs, and tridents, While some hold Mount Meru in their hands
These are the terrifying forms of the approaching malevolent spirits
They hold up sickles, brandish discuses, roll their eyes
Lift great mountaintops in their hands
And bring down storms and rains of rock and meteor
These are the terrifying malevolent spirits approaching
They blow hurricanes, bring down rainstorms
Shoot off billions of lightning bolts
Roar with thunder, and sway trees
Yet the leaves on the Bodhi tree remain still
The rain pours down in torrents; Rivers overflow and flood the land
So many terrifying things have appeared That even inanimate trees fall over
As they witness these terrible forms, All of them ugly and misshapen
Unperturbed by the spectacle of the army of rogues
With a mind like the sky, he is just fine
The Son of the Śākyas has realized the essential truth That all phenomena arise in dependence and lack reality
Whoever thinks of “me” and “mine” And clings to objects and the body, Should be afraid and terrified, Since they are in the clutches of ignorance
He meditates steadfastly, established in the Dharma
Since he sees them in this manner that accords with the Dharma
He sees all phenomena as illusion, Like a dream, and like clouds
Yet the One Who Has Qualities, Marks, and Splendor Keeps his mind unshaken, like Mount Meru
Such are the faces of the approaching army
while those who supported Māra took a stand on his left side
Now Māra asked his sons
“What type of army should we use to subdue the Bodhisattva?
Standing to his right, Māra’s son Sārthavāha spoke this verse to his father
“Would you want to wake up the leader of the nāgas
Would you want to wake up the leader of the elephants
That is like wanting to disturb the leader of men from his ease.
Standing to his left, Māra’s son Durmati replied
“Even at the mere sight of us, people’s hearts burst
And so does the solid core of great trees
Monks, at that time the Bodhisattva uttered these verses in order to bring even more joy to the assembly of gods
The entire fine realm of the Heaven of Joy was covered knee deep in celestial flowers
From the right side, Madhura­nirghoṣa spoke
Struck by my stare, what power would this monk have? Or struck by death, what power would he have to live in this world?
The  million gods gained the pure eye regarding phenomena, unblemished and untainted
“Why is that
You may hold a spear in each of your hands And use them all, yet that will bring you nothing
The , gods who had previously been trained gained acceptance that phenomena are nonarising
 “If it is advantageous to have one hundred arms, Why do bodily hairs not become arms
out of the assembly of gods, , gods gave rise to the mind of unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening
“My body has one hundred arms, And with just one of them I can shoot off one hundred arrows
Monks, when the Bodhisattva taught this chapter, “The Gateways to the Light of the Dharma,
O father, I will break the body of this monk! Be happy and go now without delay.
From the right side, Subuddhi said
From the left side, Śatabāhu said
which a bodhisattva must teach to the assembly of gods at the time of his passing.
“These, friends, are known as the  gateways to the light of the Dharma
“Moreover: To cross the ocean using one’s hands And to drink its water is impossible for people
You could not even open your eyes in his presence
Even if you could destroy Mount Meru with your stare
“What solid core do trees have for that matter? You say ‘I will break him by staring,’ but can you do that, people
Yet looking directly at the Bodhisattva’s stainless face Would be even harder than that.
“And moreover: All the powerful ones in the sky, the earth, and the waters
Whether humans or guhyakas, may hold up their swords and axes
But when they go to the leader of men, who has the power of forbearance
They all change from very strong, to strong, to weak.
I will enter his beautiful body And then I will burn it
Just like a low forest fire Would burn a dry, hollow tree.
On the right side, Sunetra replied
“You may burn the entire Mount Meru And enter, invisible, into the earth
He does not have an army
Where are his allies? Why do you fear him?
From the right side, Ekāgramati said
“In the universe, the sun and the moon have no army
And the universal monarch and the lion have no army
Likewise this Bodhisattva has no army
Yet he is capable of destroying Namuci single-handedly.
From the left side, Avatāraprekṣin said
“He has no lances or spears, no clubs or swords, No horses, elephants, chariots, or foot soldiers
and to manifest great parinirvāṇa
That single arrogant monk, sitting there— Father, I will kill him today, please have no worries.
to turn the wheel of Dharma
From the right side, Puṅyālaṃkāra said
“His body is unshakable and indestructible like Nārāyaṇa’s
He wears an armor of forbearance and wields the sword of unbendable diligence
The threefold liberation is his steed, and knowledge is his bow. Father
to go to the seat of awakening
to tame Māra
to attain complete awakening
through the force of his merit, the Bodhisattva will conquer Māra’s army.
 From the left side, Anivartin said
“The fire burning on the plains does not shy away from burning the grass
The arrow shot skillfully cannot be stopped by a learned one
The bolt of lightning shooting across the sky does not return
One could still not move the Bodhisattva from the seat of awakening.
From the left side, Anupaśānta said
“With the great poison of my gaze, I can burn Mount Meru And turn the waters in the great oceans to ashes
So, father, look at the seat of awakening and that monk As I now turn both of them to ashes with my gaze.
From the right side, Siddhārtha said
 “You may be able to fill the world with poison And put ablaze the great trichiliocosm
Yet by a mere glance from the One Who Is the Source of All Good Qualities
Or gather the minds of all sentient beings, as many as there are, into one, Or, my father, bind the sun, the moon, and the wind with a noose
Your poison will lose its toxicity
No weapon or poison will be able to harm him
So, father, please, let us all turn back.
From the left side, Ratilola said
From the right side, Dharmarati said
I will provide sexual pleasure and bring him under your control.
“I will play thousands of instruments And send forth billions of well-adorned divine girls Who will get him excited and lead him to our exquisite harem
He does not delight in the pleasures of passion.
From the left side, Vātajava said
“I can at once swallow the sun and the moon And the wind blowing through the sky
Father, I will catch that mendicant this very day And blow him away like a handful of husk.
From the right side, Māra’s son named Acalamati said
“Even if all gods and humans became As swift and strong as you are And gathered in a single place, They would be unable to harm this peerless being.
From the left side, Brahmamati said
“If there was such a fierce crowd of our men, He could do nothing to wound your pride
Since all tasks are accomplished by teams, How could he harm you just on his own?
From the right side, Siṃhamati said
 “Lions have never been seen sitting on the ground in a row
Those with a poisonous gaze do not team up
Those splendorous beings that have courage because of being true, Those supreme leaders of beings also do not congregate together.
From the left side, Sarvacaṇḍāla said
“Father, you have not heard such heated voices before As those your sons are calling out with now
Would you want to wake up the king of the animals
“A noble one without evil Shines perpetually
venerable Khadiravaṇika
Then they move through the world more naked than naked
the Blessed One received abundant savory food and drink, robes, alms bowls
bedding, healing medicines and remedies, and other appropriate necessities
“There are those who conceal their mind and restrain their senses
“This teaching proclaims how he attained the result brought about by the concordant cause of all the bodhisattva activities
Please teach it to illuminate all the enlightened activities of the Buddha.
That you will become a buddha, the supreme tamer of gods and humans, The foremost in the world, and a storehouse of hundreds of qualities
his mind was as firm and unmoving as Mount Meru
“It is for the sake of those for whom you have previously given up The best of wealth, and even your head, arms, and legs
When you reach the right place on the earth
You shall awaken to the incomparable wisdom of the victorious ones
Great Sage, now is your time
“Therefore, Virtuous One, quickly leave this fine city And practice the conduct of previous sages
Open up the limitless river of Dharma for sentient beings
“Your stainless and virtuous discipline has never been broken
Until now you have always been adorned by the best qualities
Great Sage, no one has discipline like you
Now you must free beings from their many afflictions
“For hundreds of lives you trained in forbearance
You had patience with all kinds of evil words from others
Through patience you are forbearing, self-controlled, and at ease
Lord of Men, now you must decide to depart from home
“Your diligence is firm, steadfast, and unshakable; Bliss-Gone One, you are great from beginning to end
instructed them
“This is why you have practiced disciplined conduct and austeritie
inspired them
To burn the afflictions of these evil and degenerate times
delighted them
Now let a rain of nectar fall To soothe the thirst of those who for so long have had no protector
and caused them to be receptive
“You are skilled in the supreme actions of knowledge
He then said to that assembly of fortunate gods
Your wisdom is vast and limitless
“Friends, I will now proceed to Jambudvīpa
So now, Virtuous One, shine the beautiful light of knowledge On those who are caught in delusion and doubt
“For hundreds of lives you have trained in love
As well as compassion, joy, and equanimity
I attracted sentient beings through the four activities of giving, pleasant speech, beneficial activity, and demonstrating consistency in speech and aims
All those perfect acts that you have performed, You must now share with sentient beings.
Through all the splendor of the victorious ones in the ten directions
These verses, the wonderful blossoms of qualities, come about
Through music they reverberate beautifully, Encouraging the youth who rests on his couch
At that time the joyful maidens who bring pleasure, Beautiful as they are, play melodious tunes
At the same time the victorious ones in the ten directions, who tame gods and humans
But friends, I would be acting without gratitude, and it would be inappropriate, if I were not now to achieve unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening.
Let this perfect speech be heard through the instruments in a pleasant sound
“You, who benefit beings and possess many qualities, Have made the virtues of the victorious ones your own as you traveled the paths
Remember your past disciplined conduct and austerities
Quick, go to the supreme tree and attain the state of immortality
“Gods and humans are thirsty, lacking the qualities of the victorious ones
Yet your resolve equals the task, so grant them the nectar of immortality
You possess the features of the ten powers, and all learned ones venerate you
Quick, Lord of Men, dispense that nectar
“You, Benefactor of the World, delight in the qualities of the victorious ones
In your past lives you gave away your wealth, jewels, and gold
Yet your mind remained undisturbed and you performed your caste duties
“Previously you were a virtuous, quick-darting parrot that lived in a tree
“In the past you were the finest of horses, as white as snow
“Intelligent One, the time for renunciation has come
“You have been Candraprabha, Viśeṣagāmin, and Reṇu, lord of the ten directions
To Śālendrarāja you offered clarified butter, and milk to Puṣpita
To Yaśodatta you offered kuruṇṭa flowers, and food to Satyadarśin
“Now limitless eons have passed, and those buddhas have passed into nirvāṇa
“Just like a terrifying fire pit, So the noble ones understand desire
“There are hundreds of diseases, and being struck by sickness Brings torment to beings, like deer tormented by forest fire
“Just as the heavy snow during winter Steals all life from grass, trees, and herbs
They have the nature of quickly coming and going
“Conditioned things are like the light of a candle
He then took the crown from his own head and placed it on the head of the bodhisattva Maitreya, saying
“Since the combination of these three is needed— The lower and upper pieces of wood, and the action of the hand
Then he again spoke to the great retinue of gods
“Beings are scorched by attachment and anger, Yet they are falsely imputed—such ills are not for real
Guide, release the stream of nectar, The cooling waters of peace from the cloud of compassion
“Friends, in what form should I enter the womb of a mother?
Some replied, “As a human in the form of a young brahmin.
“ ‘Once I attain supreme awakening, I will gather noble wealth for beings.
Skillful One, saying this you sought out supreme awakening, And for many millions of eons you made offerings to the learned
Gather them with your noble wealth
“ ‘I will put up with beings’ hostility and anger, And liberate everyone from the ocean of existence
“ ‘I will prepare the ship of Dharma
“So depart from home now While you are still young and in your prime
“Beings are blind in the darkness of their stupor And bound by the web of wrong views
or Brahmā
or a great king
or Vaiśravaṇa
Even your father, mother, friends, and relative
His clothes are saffron colored and his actions so peaceful
These are the dreams that appear to the daughter of the Śākyas
“When you dream that your pearl necklace breaks And your beautiful golden chain is broken
Those who are nourished by the splendor of merit and have merit in their heart Will see in their dreams splendorous signs, Which occur to supreme beings, who have accumulated virtuous karma, At the time of their departure from home
He tried to get up from his bed, but did not succeed
Even the sages who live for eons are not beyond Degeneration and the dreads of sickness, old age, and dying.
The elders of the Śākya clan, both male and female, were also placed everywhere at road intersections, junctions, and many highways in order to guard the Bodhisattva
In order to further guard the Bodhisattva, each of the young Śākya men had five hundred chariots at their disposal, and along with each chariot were five hundred infantrymen. Likewise they placed five hundred young men by the southern, western, and northern city gates to guard the Bodhisattva. All the men were armed, trained in combat, skilled in archery and javelin throwing, and were as strong as powerful wrestlers. In order to further guard the Bodhisattva, each of the young Śākya men had five hundred chariots at their disposal, and along with each chariot were five hundred infantrymen
“You girls with lances in your hands
“For people bloated with pride, this teacher will be heavy; For those who are loving and respectful, he will be light
Inspired by the lords of gods
In this way the Bodhisattva remained mindful of the body as something that must be left behind
Then he saw two gods,  the Sun and Moon, standing on his right and left sides
Mustering diligence, speed, and power, Let’s quickly go and destroy that monk!
From the right side, Siṃhanādin said
“In the midst of the jungle, when the lion is not there, Many jackals bark
Yet when they hear the lion’s frightening roar, They flee in panic in all directions
“In the same way, these ignorant sons of Māra
As long as they have not heard the voice of the perfect man
Raise their voices, opinionated and impudent, While the lion of men remains silent.
From the left side, Duścintita­cintin said
“Whatever I wish for is quickly accomplished
So why does he not look at us with circumspection
From the right side, Sucintitārtha said
He must be either deluded or ignorant Since he does not rise up quickly and flee.
“He is neither a fool nor a weakling; You yourselves are the fools, so extremely careless
You have no idea about his valor
The power of his insight will conquer you all
Its head should be very red and exceedingly handsome
“Even with the strength of demonic sons Equal in number to the grains of sand in the river Ganges
You would not be able to bend a single hair on his head
So how much less could you kill him
“Do not corrupt your minds
Instead you should respect him with devotion
He is about to become king of the three realms; Turn back and do not make war.
The leaders of the demigods, and the leaders of the garuḍas
Now they all join their palms and bow to the Bodhisattva
“All those who normally follow you, such as Śakra, The guardians, the hordes of half kiṃnaras
In this way a thousand of Māra’s sons, both good and bad, each further addressed Māra, the evil one, in verses.  At the end, Bhadrasena, the general of Māra, spoke these verses to him
“Even those of your sons who are wise
Who are powerful and smart
“Wherever this army is found, The cries of the jackal and the owl are heard
When the calls of the crow and the donkey ring out, It is wise to quickly retreat
“Please look toward the seat of awakening
Clever curlews, swans, cuckoos, and peacocks Are circumambulating the Bodhisattva
He will surely conquer Māra’s army
“Since the gods at the peak of existence Are unable to see the crown of his head
“Since the immaculate hair between his eyebrows Beautifies a trillion realms And outshines all of us
“The sons of the victors manifest such great powers As an act of worship
For isn’t the Supreme Being A worthy recipient of the best of offering rites
He is supreme among them, For he does not harm any living being
“Whatever sages there are who practice disciplined conduct And practice austerities
He burned the Daṇḍaka Forest So that for many years no grass would grow
“When the supreme, masterful sage Became angry with King Brahmadatta
He will reduce this army to dust, Just as countries are destroyed by the sages
Yet at the seat of awakening, the ground is stainless like gold, So it is better for the wise to retreat
It is certain that today the victory will be his
“Wherever this army is found, Dust and soot rain from the sky. Yet at the seat of awakening, a rain of flowers falls, So heed my words and turn back! “Wherever this army is found, The ground is uneven and filled with thorns and prickles
So, surely, without being taught by others, He will attain omniscience
“Since Mount Meru and the surrounding ranges, The sun, the moon, Śakra, Brahmā
All the trees, and the best of mountains All prostrate to the seat of awakening
“It is certain that the one with the power of merit, The powers of knowledge and wisdom, And the powers of forbearance and diligence, Will render Māra’s factions powerless
“Like an elephant stepping on a fresh clay pot, Or a lion fighting a fox
Or the sun effacing a firefly, The Bliss-Gone One will obliterate our army.
Upon hearing these words, another son of Māra became enraged and, with bloodshot eyes, he said
Can’t you see this great and terrifying army?
What could that single man be capable of
“Your praise for this lone person Is without any bounds
Then from the right side, the son of Māra called Māra­pramardaka said
“It is not necessary to help the sun in this world, Nor the lion or the universal monarch
The Bodhisattva sitting with resolve for awakening Surely does not need any helpers.
Māra perceived that the Bodhisattva was brandishing a sword in his hand, and so he fled toward the south
However, thinking that it could not be true after all, he again returned
The Bodhisattva now touched his right hand to his head
He then embraced Māra, the evil one, and his demonic retinue with thoughts of love and compassion
The Bodhisattva replied
“Evil one, the earth here is my witness.
But you have no witness to your acts, So there is no point in speaking of them, and instead you will be conquered.
“Previously I made a wholesome act of giving; It was an unstinting act, and you are my witness
I have cut off my hands, legs, eyes, and my head, and given them to beggars
I, on the other hand, have performed trillions of unstinting acts of giving
The Bodhisattva answered Māra, the evil one, with words that were firm, profound, vast, gentle, and sweet
“You, evil one! Through just a single unstinting act of giving, you have become lord of the desire realm
He called out to the Bodhisattva
“Listen, young prince, get up
Get up and relish your kingship—your virtue lies precisely in doing that! On what grounds could you ever attain liberation?
When Māra, the evil one, witnessed the Bodhisattva’s power and the displays that he performed, his mind was disturbed with jealousy and avarice
The flower garlands hung as adornments on the Bodhi tree
and a cooling rain of flower petals fell on the ground
This was the first omen
As soon as the Bodhisattva touched this great earth, it shook in six different ways
It quivered, trembled, and quaked, and it boomed, thundered, and roared
So may she bear my witness.
She is my witness that I speak no lies
Some made clinking sounds with their anklets
Some showed their breasts adorned with strings of pearls
Some showed off their half-naked thighs
Some displayed jays, parrots, and myna birds sitting on their heads and shoulders
This was the second omen
Some cast sidelong glances at the Bodhisattva
Some wore good clothes, yet let them hang improperly
Some made the chains on their hips shake and twinkle
Some mischievously moved back and forth in a flirtatious manner
Some danced
Some sang
Some flirted and acted shy
Some shook their thighs like a palm tree moved by the wind
Some let out deep moans
Some dressed in transparent cloth with bells hanging from the string at their waist and walked around giggling
Some showed off all their jewelry, both the secret and the apparent
This was the third omen
Standing before the Bodhisattva, they pondered what his thoughts might be as they looked at his face
Some scattered flower petals on the Bodhisattva
Some tried to lure the Bodhisattva with offers of love
Or did he look into the distance? They looked to see if he was excited or not
This was the fourth omen
The face of the Bodhisattva, however, remained as pure and stainless as the orb of the full moon when it escapes the mouth of Rāhu
This was the fifth omen
his was the sixth omen
This was the seventh omen
Like the central mountain, it remained unmoving
Like the surrounding mountains, it was truly elevated
He guarded his senses well and
This was the eighth ome
like the elephant, his look was that of someone with a mind well tamed
Now the daughters of Māra
in a further attempt to arouse the Bodhisattva’s desires, spoke these verses to him
“Springtime is here, the best of seasons
Let us frolic, dear, while the trees are in bloom
Your body is so beautiful and attractive
It is enticing, has auspicious marks, and is well adorned
“We were born beautiful and with perfect curves
Queen Māyā bathed and applied perfumes to her body. She ornamented her arms with many bracelets and dressed in the softest and most beautiful garments. Joyful, happy, and rapturous, accompanied and encircled by ten thousand women
she went to where King Śuddhodana was seated comfortably in the music hall
“Our thighs resemble the trunk of an elephant
Lord, look at us, such beautiful maidens
And our broad and beautiful hips
The beautiful three folds on our bellies
She seated herself to his right side on the fine, precious throne draped with jeweled latticework
“Look at our firm and voluptuous breasts
So, O Beloved, look at us who ardently desire pleasure
With a smiling and trusting face free from anger, she spoke to King Śuddhodana in these verses
“Our faces resemble the full moon; Our lips are like ripe bimba fruit; Our teeth are white like conch shells, jasmine flowers, or snow
Our beautiful eyes are as pure and large as lotuses
Our faces have beautiful brows and are well anointed
Come now, take a look at these divine girls so beautifully adorned
Who would not be thrilled when enjoying the passion of love? Even a decayed tree would be brought back to life
Quick, stand up and enjoy the prime of youth
We are here to please gods and humans and grant complete satisfaction. Awakening is hard to gain, so change your mind
“It is for your sake that we have come here, all dressed up and adorned
Our arms are bedecked with abutting bracelets
Our hips are adorned with beautiful chains
Lord, look at us, your servants
“With the gait of a swan, we gently approach you; Soft and beautiful, we talk of amorous love
Beautifully adorned as we are, We are experts in divine pleasures
“We are well trained in singing, playing instruments, and theatrical performance
We are born with perfect bodies for the sake of pleasure
If you don’t accept us now, as we crave pleasure, You will quickly become a loser in this world
“What man would run away when he sees a treasure? You will be exactly like that, ignorant of the treasure, which is love
If you remain ignorant of amorous passion And fail to enjoy these young girls, who have come of their own will.
Monks, the Bodhisattva just smiled with unblinking eyes
He sat there smiling
with calm senses, physically at ease, resplendent, without attachment, free from anger, and without delusion
he now spoke with soft and pleasant words in a tone that exceeded even the voice of Brahmā
His voice was like that of a cuckoo, pleasant and sweet sounding, as he addressed Māra’s daughters with these verses
“Desire results in a great deal of suffering; it is the root of suffering
For the unwise, desire ruins their concentration, magical ability, and austerities; The wise say that chasing women brings no satisfaction
I will satisfy the unskillful ones with wisdom
“The thirst of someone who pursues desires increases evermore, Just like one feels after drinking salty water
If I were to engage in that, there would be no benefit to me or to others, And I delight in being useful to both myself and to others
“Your beauty is like water bubbles or foam
Like magical colors, it is merely mentally created
Like a play or a dream, it is unstable and impermanent
It deludes the minds of childish beings
“The eyes are like water bubbles—they are enclosed in a membrane
Like clotted blood is enclosed in a suppurating ulcer
The belly is one big load of urine and excrement, excreting filth
This mechanism of suffering has emerged from karma and disturbing emotions
This makes them spin for a long time in cyclic existence, the source of suffering; Their suffering, experienced in hell, is extremely painful
“From the crotch, awful smells are leaked; The thighs, the calves, and the feet are joined together like a mechanical contraption
When I examine you, I see that you are like an illusion
“Even if the whole world were filled with the likes of you Who besieged me here, for eons on end
I would not feel anger, attachment, or delusion, Because the mind of the victorious ones is like the sky
On a soft and sweetly scented bed scattered with flowers
I do not feel dislike or joy; My mind is free, like the wind in the sky
“I have neither attachment nor anger; I do not perceive anything permanent, attractive, or with a self
Which has deceptively emerged from causes and conditions
“Although the gods and goddesses in their purity and splendor Have no blood or bones
They all live in great fear Since they lack permanence and cannot endure.
At that point Māra’s daughters
“I will be the master of the three realms, venerated by gods and humans
You will become a king, a supreme ruler, a powerful master of the earth
Flocks of beautiful women will play thousands of instruments for you
After many magical displays, they said, “You, with your lotus-like face, listen to us
So today he will conquer Māra and become a worthy one with the ten powers
This is the time when the Bliss-Gone One attains immortality
Ignorant fools engage in them continually, yet the skilled ones renounce them
Like roaring thunder, his beautiful voice resounds like that of the king of beasts
This person, who benefits others, utters only meaningful words
He is immutable like the king of mountains, with a body like the rising sun
For thousands of eons he delighted in discipline, austerities, and hardships
The time to experience the joys of pleasure has arrived
Cuckoos, swans, and peacocks call out, and flocks of birds fill the air
Among all seasons, springtime is the best; At this time men and women frolic, and darkness and dust disappear
They danced like the shoots of young creepers on a tree blowing in the breeze To stir lust in the prince sitting under the tree branches
The most seductive and sweet girls, Tṛṣṇā, Rati, and Arati, These three graceful ones hastily arrived, sent by Māra
On this topic, it is said
They displayed love gestures, showed off their adorned bodies, and tried even further female trickery in their attempts to seduce the Bodhisattva
skilled as they were in female deception, felt even greater lust, haughtiness, and pride
I will be a king who travels by the wheel of Dharma, endowed with ten powers
A million seekers‌, and those with no more need for learning, will always bow to me; Because I enjoy the Dharma, I no longer seek joyful objects.
“For as long as your youth has not passed and you are in your prime
For as long as disease has not struck you and you are not old and gray haired
“I renounce all anger, aggression, stupidity, and conceit; Renouncing all covetousness, I will be content with my own wealth
For so long you should enjoy the pleasures of love with a smile on your face.
Until I am rid of the suffering and bondage in the realms of gods and demigods
Until old age, disease, and death show their angry faces
For so long I will train on the auspicious path that leads to the city of fearlessness.
I will travel this path of the ten virtuous actions
Since everything that grows from the ground will wither under the sun
And bees also seek out flowers because of suffering from hunger and thirst
On the ground grows fresh green grass, so soft and thick
“Desire is ephemeral like dew on the tip of grass, or like autumn clouds
Desire is terrifying like the wrath of the nāga girls
Śakra, the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, and the gods in the Heaven of Joy, all fall under the sway of Māra; Desire plagues all ignoble ones, so how could anyone rejoice in that?
I have resolved to actualize the nectar that all victorious ones have enjoyed.
Māra’s daughters insisted
“Look at us! Our faces are like the moon and like fresh lotus flowers
Our speech is soft and pleasant, and our teeth as white as snow or silver
Such beauties are rare among the gods, so how about among humans
These women that you have here are even desired by the highest of gods.
It easily breaks and perishes, and is thoroughly without pleasure
The daughters now put on sixty-four displays of amorous behavior
They rang their anklets and girdles and let their clothes slip off
Struck with the arrow of desire, infatuated, with smiles on their faces, they said
“Lord, do we appear so ugly to you that you don’t share our love?
Knowing the faults in all of saṃsāra, the Stainless One replied
“Desire is like a sword, a spear, a trident, or a razor blade smeared with honey
It is like the head of a viper or a fire pit—that much I have realized
So, since women steal one’s virtues, I have abandoned their company.
With all the billions of skills that induce amorous infatuation, The girls were unable to seduce the Bliss-Gone One who has the gait of a young elephant
So with shame and embarrassment, they now bowed to the feet of the Sage
Giving rise to respect, joy, and love, they praised the Benefactor
“Your face is like the spotless center of a lotus, or the harvest moon
Your luster is like the flames of a sacrificial fire, or the shine of the golden mountain
They praised the one who is like the bayur tree, or the campaka
They circumambulated the Supreme Being, who was immutable like a majestic mountain
Returning, they bowed their heads to their father and told him
“Father, this master of gods and humans has no fear or anger
“With a smiling face he looks on with eyes like lotus petals
Never does he look at others with attachment or a frown
Mount Meru may tremble, the oceans dry up, and the sun and moon fall
But never will He Who Sees the Faults of the Three Existences come under the sway of amorous women.
When Māra, the evil one, heard these words, he felt even more miserable and unhappy
Angry and disappointed, he told his daughters
“Oh my, that stupid fool, so ignorant that he doesn’t see your beauty and good looks
How can it be that we are unable to get him away from the seat of awakening?
Then once again, the daughters of Māra spoke to their father in verse
Pay homage to him and touch their heads to his feet
The gods and Brahmā, pure beings possessing the splendor of virtue
For many millions of eons he has practiced ethics and disciplined conduct
“He accumulated the splendors of hundreds of virtues and qualities
Like the foremost king of mountains, he was immutable
Yet, although he saw it all, his mind wasn’t distracted even once
“Father, we tried every female trick on him
With all our lust, surely his heart should have melted
“Your Highness, I beseech you, quick, say yes today
He is far removed from lust and has no desire
“He clearly realizes the faults of women
Although he sees the entire body, his thoughts remain profound
“Although we speak to him softly and lovingly, he does not get aroused
Even though we show him the most secret of things, he does not get hostile
No matter what acts he witnesses, he remains without delusion
Neither in divine abodes, nor here on earth, is there a human or a god Capable of gauging his mind and actions
“Once he conquers Māra’s army, He will surely attain sacred awakening, just as the victorious ones did in the past
Please rejoice as I am nearby you in strict discipline
Father, he does not seek fights or quarrels with us
Even though our forces are powerful, our task would be a difficult one
“Father, look at the sky, where millions of perfect Bodhisattvas, With jewels on the top of their heads, respectfully wait
On their limbs these sources of wealth are adorned with flower garlands
They possess the ten powers and have come here to venerate him
“Everything animate, and even the inanimate, too, Trees, mountains, gods, yakṣas, and garuḍas, All bow down to that mountain of qualities
Father, it would be better to leave him alone today.
“Moreover: One will not cross where one cannot reach the end
One will not dig where one cannot pull out the root
One cannot make him angry, or even make him suffer with forbearance
One can do nothing that would make him unhappy.
“Pure Being, your mind is firm; Like the earth, you sustain all beings
Protector of the World, your mind is vast, Like the unlimited sky
“Supreme Being, you are hard to fathom, Like the ocean rich in jewels
Pure Being, you are elevated, Like the ring of surrounding mountains
“Supreme Being, you shine forth, Like the king of mountains in the middle of the ocean
Pure Being, you roar, Like a lion with a mane, moving in the jungle
“Pure Being, you have bloomed, Like a lotus in a pond
With your pure mind, you are radiant, Like the sun at dawn
“Sacred One, you are beautiful, Like the moon during the bright fortnight
Supreme Being, your mind is never turbid; Like the lake Anavapta, it is always calm
“Supreme Being, your mind is without a fixed abode; Like wind, it never lingers anywhere in the world
Supreme Being, you are hard to meet with; Like the king of brightness, you are free from all conceit
“Sacred One, you are very powerful; Like Nārāyaṇa, you are hard to tame
Protector of the World, your resolve is firm; You will not move from the seat of awakening
“Like a lightning bolt released from the hand of Indra, Supreme Being, you cannot be turned back
Supreme Being, you will attain your aim in full; Soon you will be endowed with the complete ten powers.
What were these sixteen? They were
“Evil one, you are lost; You are brooding like an old crane
Evil one, you are powerless, Like an old elephant sinking in a swamp
“Evil one, you are on your own, Like a loser pretending to be a hero
“Evil one, you are garrulous, Like an impudent crow
Evil one, you are overcome with pride, Like an ungrateful ruffian
“Evil one, today you will flee, Like a jackal at the sound of a lion’s roar
Evil one, you are the lowest of the low, Like a poor man who gets envious
“Evil one, you are on the wrong path, Like a traveler who has lost his way
Evil one, you are thrown on your back, Like a tree tossed about by the wind
“Evil one, you are weak, Like a young bull pained by a heavy load
Evil one, you have no one with you, Like someone suffering from a contagious disease, abandoned in a forest
Evil one, today you will be scattered about, Like a bird tossed around by the roaring wind
“Evil one, not knowing when the time is right, You are like a beggar whose merit has run out
Evil one, today you will be abandoned, Like a broken pot full of dust
“Evil one, today you will be restrained by the Bodhisattva, Like a snake by a spell
Evil one, you are completely powerless, Like Uruṇḍa, who lost his arms and legs.
Monks, in these sixteen ways the gods from the pure realms tried to discourage Māra
And, monks, the gods who attended upon the Bodhisattva now also tried to break Māra’s resolve in sixteen ways
What were these sixteen
They were
“Evil one, today you will be defeated by the Bodhisattva, Like an enemy soldier by a hero
Evil one, today you will be held down by the Bodhisattva, Like a weak wrestler by a powerful one
“Evil one, today you will be outmatched by the Bodhisattva, Like a firefly by the sun
Evil one, today you will be scattered by the Bodhisattva, Like a handful of chaff by a strong wind
“Evil one, today you will be terrified by the Bodhisattva, Like a jackal by a lion
Evil one, today you will be felled by the Bodhisattva, Like a great sāl tree whose roots have been cut
“Evil one, today you will be destroyed by the Bodhisattva, Like a hostile city by a great king
Evil one, today you will be dried up by the Bodhisattva, Like the water-filled footprint of a cow
“Evil one, today you will flee from the Bodhisattva, Like a criminal escaping execution
Evil one, today you will be sent swirling by the Bodhisattva, Like a swarm of bees by the heat of fire
“Evil one, today you will be hurt by the Bodhisattva, Like a lawful king who has lost his kingdom
Evil one, today you will brood because of the Bodhisattva, Like an old crane with clipped wings
“Evil one, today you will be deprived of livelihood by the Bodhisattva, Like a weary traveler without provisions in a wilderness
Evil one, today you will be weeping because of the Bodhisattva, Like someone shipwrecked at sea
“Evil one, today you will be depleted of life force by the Bodhisattva, Like grass and trees by the fire at the end of an eon
Evil one, today you will be crushed by the Bodhisattva, Like a mountaintop by a mighty thunderbolt.
Monks, although the gods who attended upon the Bodhisattva tried to discourage Māra, the evil one, in these sixteen ways, Māra would not be deterred
On this topic, it is said
“Monk, what are you doing here in the wilderness on your own
It is not an easy task to find that which you seek
Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras, and others who exerted themselves in austerities Did not attain that supreme state, so forget about you, an ordinary man.
While you watch powerlessly, I shall attain awakening.
If you are the master of sense pleasures, you should not go to the lower realms
Look who I am in reality—I am master of the Dharma
“If you are master of sense pleasures, you are clearly not a master at all
So get up! Since you are in my realm, follow my orders!
“I am lord of desires and master of the universe
But it is impossible that someone like me would ever move from the king of trees.
It is possible that all beings may think and act in unison and the great oceans may dry out
All the stars, the planets, and the moon may fall from the sky to the earth
“The king of mountains, Mount Meru, may move and all beings may cease to be
But the only liberation in store for this mendicant is to get up and flee.
If he is liberated, he will liberate my realm and other realms as well
The excellent king commanded his entourage, “Make the finest preparations in the upper quarters of the palace
Although hosts of deities ask him to turn back, Antaka does not pay heed; Instead he says, “Tear him up! Beat him! Destroy him! Don’t let him escape alive
The Bodhisattva said
Māra replied
“With a mind possessed by anger and full of desire for the divine realms
And a belief that the self is either permanent or impermanent
And the thought that liberation is a place you can go to
With such mistaken preconceptions, past sages practiced austerities
I will explain to the world about the origin and arising of things, And also about nirvāṇa, the cool state where suffering is pacified.
Take him to my palace, shackle, fetter, and yoke him, and make him my gatekeeper
Māra, upset, angry, and furious, shouted harsh words
I will watch him suffer and cry out uncontrollably in many different ways, a slave of the gods.
With the voice of Brahmā and the call of the cuckoo bird
You will come under the control of Māra, like the moon seized by the demigod.
But today you will meet your doom in this great battle
You are youthful, praised and honored by gods and humans
“You are as bright as gold from the Jambū River, or the pericarp of the campaka flower
Oh, our son, our dear child, are you not annihilated already
“When you see this terrifying army of Māra
Yet you, or countless beings like you, will never force me away from this tree.
The Bliss-Gone One spoke to the hordes of yakṣas and rākṣasas
“He who hopes to remove someone like me from this perfect tree Is a fool who tries to frighten space itself
Not even someone who can draw all the water in the oceans through a single straw
“Who among us has the courage to follow joyfully This being, one with such perfect appearance
Māra, being thus restrained, became angry; He held aloft his unsheathed, sharp sword
“Monk, quick, get up and do as I tell you, Or I will cut you right away like a bamboo twig or dūrvā grass.
The Bodhisattva replied
“Even if this trichiliocosm were filled with demons
And each of them brandished a sword as large as Mount Meru
They could not bend a hair on my body, let alone kill me
Do not disbelieve me; I am reminding you of my firm resolve.
With faces of camels, oxen, and elephants, and terrifying eyes
With venomous snakes for arms, with horrible poisonous eyes
They hurled erupting volcanoes at him, As well as trees with their roots, and copper and iron
They gathered like clouds from the four directions, Roaring and raining down bolts of lightning, iron balls, Swords, spears, sharp axes, and poisoned arrows
They spoke to one another in these words
They shattered the earth’s surface and pulverized trees
Some had one hundred hands and shot one hundred arrows
From their mouths they shot out poisonous snakes and fire
While seizing crocodiles and other aquatic creatures from the ocean
Some transformed into garuḍas and pounced at snakes
Friends, who among us will have the courage to serve the Bodhisattva constantly and ceaselessly as he travels to the womb of his mother
This pure being understood that they were like an illusion
when he is born
As he witnessed this army of demons, ugly with unnatural forms
Blazing lightning bolts sprang forth from their eyes
Their hands and feet were turned the wrong way, and their heads were afire
Some jumped in front of him and some attacked him from behind
Yelling out, “You child!” they attacked from the left and from the right
as he grows and plays as a young child
Hitting the ground, they made the earth quake And stirred up the underground masses of water
Infuriated, some hurled iron balls the size of Mount Meru, As well as blazing mountain peaks
“There is no Māra here, no army, no being, and also no self
Like the moon reflected in a pond, so does this threefold universe revolve
No one created these phenomena and no one experiences them
They arise in dependency and are empty both from within and without.
As he proclaimed the truth that phenomena are empty
and when he renounces his home and is practicing austerities
The yakṣas who are agreeable to discipline Perceived the weapons in their hands to be flower garlands
Such was the result of the words spoken by the One Who Always Speaks the Truth
And said, “This earth is my witness
He stretched out his hand, like a lightning bolt striking from the sky
He gracefully ran his right hand over his body from head to toe— The hand, which was adorned with a fine web, Which had beautiful copper-colored nails, sparkling like gold from the Jambū River, And was marked with a thousand-spoked wheel, and was auspicious with the merit of virtue
In the past I have made millions of elaborate sacrifices And never denied those who petitioned me
“Water and fire and wind are my witnesses, And so are Brahmā, the lord of beings, the moon, the sun, and the stars
In fact all the gradual practices of awakening are my witnesses
“However many beings there are in the ten directions
He gracefully touched his hand to the earth So that the earth resounded like a copper vase
As Māra heard this, he fell to the ground
And then heard the words, “Strike! Catch this friend of darkness.
Disoriented, they could not find their way, and without resting place or protection, They fled like birds seeing a forest fire
As Māra’s body started to sweat, his splendor disappeared and his face grew pale
Māra now saw himself overcome by old age
He beat his chest and cried out in fear, with no protector in sight
Māra’s mind was confused and his thoughts befuddled
His elephants, horses, conveyances, and chariots all fell to the ground
The yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and flesh eaters were terrified and ran
This concludes the twenty-first chapter, on conquering Māra
“In order to tame Māra, you entered this battle
And the experiences of a buddha you shall attain today
The ten powers, the unique qualities, the distinct realizations
The goddess replied
Alas! If only beings understood how to extinguish this massive heap of pure anguish marked foremost by old age, sickness, and death.
Then the Bodhisattva continued to think
It is anguished by birth, old age, sickness, death, departure, and rebirth
but it does not know how to remove itself from this massive heap of pure anguish, marked foremost by old age, sickness, and death
He thought
“What is the prerequisite for old age and dying to take place
And what is the causal condition of aging and death?
Birth is the causal condition of old age and death.
What is the causal condition of birth?
Existence is the causal condition of birth.
Clinging is the causal condition of existence.
What is the causal condition of clinging?
Craving is the causal condition of clinging.
Feeling is the causal condition of craving.
“What is the prerequisite for feeling to take place
What is the causal condition of feeling?
Contact is the causal condition of feeling.
What is the causal condition of contact?
The six sense fields are the causal condition of contact.
What is the causal condition of the six sense fields?
Name and form is the causal condition of the six sense fields.
The Bodhisattva then wondered
What is the causal condition of craving?
What is the causal condition of existence?
It then occurred to him, “Aging and death happen when there is birth
It then occurred to him, “Birth happens when there is existence
It then occurred to the Bodhisattva, “Existence occurs when there is clinging
It then occurred to him, “Clinging occurs when there is craving
It then occurred to him, “Craving occurs when there is feeling
It then occurred to him, “Feeling happens when there is contact
It then occurred to him, “Contact happens when the six sense fields are present
It then occurred to him, “The six sense fields emerge when there is name and form
Then the Bodhisattva thought again, “What is the prerequisite for birth to take place
Then the Bodhisattva wondered, “What is the prerequisite for existence to emerge
Then the Bodhisattva wondered, “What is the prerequisite for clinging to occur
Then the Bodhisattva thought, “What is the prerequisite for craving to take place
Then the Bodhisattva thought, “What is the prerequisite for contact to occur
Then the Bodhisattva wondered, “What is the prerequisite for the six sense fields to emerge
The Bodhisattva then thought, “What is the prerequisite for name and form to come into being
What is the causal condition of name and form?” It then occurred to him
“Name and form come into being when there is consciousness
Consciousness is the causal condition of name and form.
Then the Bodhisattva wondered, “What is the prerequisite for consciousness to form
What is the causal condition of consciousness?
It then occurred to him, “Consciousness emerges when there are formations
Formations are the causal condition of consciousness.
The Bodhisattva then pondered, “What is the prerequisite for formations to form
What is the causal condition for formations?
It then occurred to him, “Formations come into being when there is ignorance
Ignorance is the causal condition of formations.
Then, monks, the thought occurred to the Bodhisattva
“Ignorance provides the causal condition for formations
Formations provide the causal condition for consciousness
Consciousness provides the causal condition for name and form
Name and form provides the causal condition for the six sense fields
The six sense fields provide the causal condition for contact
Contact provides the causal condition for feeling
Feeling provides the causal condition for craving
Craving provides the causal condition for clinging
Clinging provides the causal condition for existence
Existence provides the causal condition for birth
Birth provides the causal condition for old age and death, lamentation, pain, despair, and torment. Such is how this massive heap of pure anguish comes into being.
Monks, through considering and ruminating over these factors, which had never before been heard, there dawned in the Bodhisattva wisdom
vision, knowledge, intelligence, prudence, and insight, and a light began to shine
Then the Bodhisattva thought, “What must be absent for old age and death not to occur
What must be prevented to eliminate old age and death?
It then occurred to him, “When there is no birth, old age and death do not happen. Old age and death are prevented by preventing birth.
Desiring beauty that is pleasing to all
Supreme bodily marks, and the blossoming of qualities
“Whoever wishes to liberate himself as well as others
Let him attend the learned one who is beautiful to behold
Monks, through considering and ruminating over these factors that had never before been heard, there dawned in the Bodhisattva wisdom
vision, knowledge, intelligence, prudence, and insight, and a light began to shine
Such is how this massive heap of pure anguish is brought to an end.
I accurately understood the precise identity of consciousness, the source of consciousness, the cessation of consciousness, and the path leading to its cessation
I accurately understood the precise identity of name and form, the source of name and form, the cessation of name and form, and the path leading to its cessation
I accurately understood the precise identity of the six sense fields, the source of the six sense fields, the cessation of the six sense fields, and the path leading to their cessation
I accurately understood the precise identity of contact, the source of contact, the cessation of contact, and the path leading to its cessation
I accurately understood the precise identity of death, the source of death, the cessation of death, and the path leading to its cessation
the supreme being
the great being
the ox among men
the elephant among men
the lion among men
the bull among men
the hero among men
the champion among men
the adept among men
the lotus among men
the white lotus among men
the supreme beast of burden among men
“Friends, let us scatter flowers! The Blessed One has reached perfect awakening!
But just then, some gods who had seen buddhas before came together and told the others
“Friends, since perfect and complete buddhas of the past all produced and manifested a sign
do not toss flowers until the Blessed One has made a sign.
Monks, the Thus-Gone One knew that the gods were in doubt
so he ascended into the sky to the height of seven palm trees
piling them up to his knees
a thick darkness was lifted
craving was purified
“The trillions of demonesses, numerous as the grains of sand in the river Ganges
Could not move or sway you from the trunk of the sublime Bodhi tree
They made trillions of offerings to you, as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges
That is why, O Lord, seated here today at the foot of the Bodhi tree, you shine
May we defeat the demon hordes and awaken to omniscience!
“By the merit of praising you, Most Eminent of Speakers, who gave eyes to the world
Sage who accomplishes all aims and is honored in the three worlds, we pay homage to you
Monks, once the sons of Māra had praised the Thus-Gone One in this manner, with palms joined they bowed to the Thus-Gone One and stood to one side
You deserve an unparalleled treatment in heaven and on earth
Monks, once the gods from the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, led by the god in charge, had praised the Thus-Gone One, with palms joined they bowed to him and stood to one side
You are the protector, the refuge, the only resort of beings here!
Proclaimed far and wide, you are without equal in the three worlds
Without indulging in desire, you take pleasure in virtue
“Though beloved in the world of gods and humans, you do not gravitate toward sense objects
And so be a sublime eye and a final refuge in these three worlds
May you course in the sky throughout the four directions like the moon
May you train gods and humans by training their minds
“Having relinquished the ubiquitous clinging to existence, suffering falsely construed
Walk here on this path traversed by those with the ten powers
Beloved in the world of gods and humans, you overturn the thoughts of others
Brilliant and Wise One, you illuminate the conduct of others
“Vanquisher of Foes, you are knowledgeable in the conduct of others
You triumph over this world, like the master of gods and humans
With the light rays from your stainless and effulgent sublime body
With your joyous speech, you delight gods and humans
“You bring joy and have abandoned afflictions and removed stains and blemishes
Your intelligence is blazing—to you we bow
Free of the stains of darkness, you have realized the immortal state
“Your speech is gentle, calm, and forthright
Next the god Sunirmita, surrounded and escorted by an assembly of gods from the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations
covered the Thus-Gone One with ribbons of silk studded with various gemstones, and in his presence praised him with these verses
“You are the light of Dharma that has arisen from relinquishing the three stains
You destroy delusion, beliefs, and ignorance, and unfold brilliance and glory
You place in the deathless state those who indulge in the wrong path
You are an object of veneration here in the world, honored in heaven and earth
“You are a physician skilled in healing, who dispenses the elixir of happiness
Monks, once the god Sunirmita and his entourage had praised the Thus-Gone One, with palms joined they bowed down to the Thus-Gone One and sat to one side
Next the god Santuṣita, along with other gods from the Heaven of Joy, approached the Thus-Gone One as he sat at the seat of awakening and draped him with a vast patchwork of divine garments
O Sage, you understand, according to intellect, who is a fitting vessel and who is not! To you, unique in the trichiliocosm and honored in heavens and on earth, we pay homage!
You remove the three stains and teach the threefold knowledge and the threefold liberation
Then he praised the Thus-Gone One in his presence with these verses
“When you were dwelling in the Heaven of Joy, you taught the Dharma liberally
That teaching of yours continues unabated; even today the gods practice the Dharma
We cannot get enough of looking at you, nor can we get enough of listening to the Dharma
Ocean of Good Qualities, Lamp of the World, to you we bow with head and heart
“When you departed from the Heaven of Joy, you exhausted all unfortunate states
Then, while seated at the Bodhi tree, you quelled the afflictions of all beings
To those for whom you discovered vast awakening and defeated Māra
With your aspiration now fulfilled, quick, turn the wheel of Dharma in detail
, gods from the Heaven Free from Strife, , gods from the Heaven of Joy, , gods from the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, , gods from the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations
, gods from the realm of Māra who were born there because of their former virtuous actions, ,  gods from the realm of Brahmā
and many hundreds of thousands of gods assembled from all the realms up to the highest heaven
Moreover, many hundreds of thousands of gods came together from the east, the south, the west, and the north. The foremost among the gods then spoke these verses to the great assembly of gods
When they arrived, they worshiped the Thus-Gone One sitting at the seat of awakening with a plethora of flowers, incense, garlands, perfumes, and unguents
“There are many thousands of beings throughout the ten directions; Let the Dharma be heard by those who seek it! May you make haste to turn the wheel in detail! May you liberate those thousands of creatures from existence!
and in his presence they praised him with these fitting verses
Enduring great hardship in the process
“It is not in vain that you have come
No one else deserves this at all
How you are worshiped by gods and humans
“Who is superior to you, you who are without equal In discipline, absorption, and insight? To you, Thus-Gone One, adept in inclinations and liberation
“You have illuminated the ten directions
Defeating the wicked one and his army You attained unexcelled awakening
Lit up the three worlds with the lamp of your insight
It is you who will remove the world’s cataracts, Bestowing upon it unexcelled eyes
“Praising you for an eon Will not even cover the pores of your body
Ocean of Good Qualities, renowned throughout the world, To you, Thus-Gone One, we pay homage with our heads bowed!
“O Sage, you are unflappable, faultless, and ever stable, like Mount Meru
With merit and splendor, your wisdom light is renowned throughout the ten directions
O Sage, you previously paid homage to hundreds of thousands of buddhas
And in their place
you have overcome the demon horde at the Bodhi tree
“Source of discipline, learning, absorption, and insight, you are the banner of wisdom
Destroyer of old age and death, you are the supreme physician, who gives eyes to the world
O Sage, having cast off the three defilements and defects, your sense faculties are restrained, your mind composed! To you, O Bull among Śākyas, Dharma King of Beings, we go for refuge
Nor are you ever drunk with conceit about your knowledge
“You do not disparage the ignorant
“Just as the previous ones attained sublime awakening on the lion throne, You have followed in their footsteps; you awakened and became the same as them
Identical in heart and mind, you have attained omniscience
Thus, Sublime Being in the World, Self-Arisen One, you are a field of merit for beings.
Who is soothing and clear minded like the moon
Whose face is smiling and whose tongue is long
To you, Supreme Enrapturing Sage, we pay homage
Upon hearing the Dharma with a stainless heart, They all attain exalted liberation
You are neither pompous nor timid
Like a firm mountain in the middle of a sea
“There is no room here for even a hai
“We see parasols, flowers, earrings, and garlands, Wreaths of campaka flowers, Necklaces, moons, and crescent moons
“Even though rains of flowers, Enough to fill a world system to the brim, Descend onto your body from the sky, They are like rivers flowing into an ocean
Since in this way they are bodies of space, No harm is caused to the celestial mansions
“The sky is filled with the guides of humans, Bodhisattvas who have come to pay tribute
Looking at your conduct, O Pristine Sentient Being, We do not see confusion in your focused mind
We clearly see all the activities of beings as they are
“Dwelling constantly in the sky, O Sage
Upon making these offerings, in his presence they praised him with these verses
As a way of paying homage to the Perfect and Completely Awakened One, the gods adorned the whole sky with a net of jewels and small bells
Then the gods of the sky approached the Thus-Gone One
Once the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, led foremost by the four great kings themselves, had praised the Thus-Gone One in repose at the seat of awakening, they joined palms and bowed to the Thus-Gone One and stood to one side
This concludes the twenty-third chapter, on exaltation
Once the terrestrial gods had praised in this manner the Thus-Gone One sitting in repose at the seat of awakening, they bowed to him with palms joined and stood to one side
We dedicate all the roots of virtue for the sake of awakening!
Shall preach or listen to the Dharma
Now that the trichiliocosm is a basis for worship, how much more so is your body
And as he abandons his entire kingdom, Throughout that time, we will serve him devotedly
“When he acquires grass and travels to the seat of awakening, And as he conquers the demons and gains awakening
“While he behaves in accord with the world, And conquers the afflictions of desire inside the women’s quarters
Then, once the seven days had passed
“It will be a great blessing for gods and humans To witness the newborn taking seven steps, To see him received by Śakra and Brahmā, And to see the Pure Being bathed with perfumed water
Innumerable gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas anointed their own bodies with the scented water that had come into contact with the body of the Thus-Gone One
This engendered among them the intention set on unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening
Even after the gods and the others had returned to their respective realms, they did not part from the scented water and desired no other scent
Through the joy and the supreme joy that are born from respectfully taking to heart the Thus-Gone One, they became irreversible from unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening
“What, O Blessed One, is the name of the absorption in which the Thus-Gone One remained for seven days without moving from the cross-legged position?
Monks, then a god named Samantakusuma, who had joined in that very audience, bowed down to the feet of the Thus-Gone One, and with palms joined said to him
the gods from the desire realm approached the Thus-Gone One, carrying tens of thousands of vases containing scented water
Monks, the god Samantakusuma then praised the Thus-Gone One with these verses
Monks, the goddesses who sport in the desire realms saw the perfection of the Bodhisattva’s bodily form and wondered
What is she like, that maiden who will conceive this sublime and supreme pure being?
Filled with curiosity
“What are you staring at for seven days
“With teeth so even and pure
And with the supremely fragrant breath of one with the ten powers, Please speak words of unadulterated truth, And thus bring joy to gods and humans!
The Moon-Faced One replied
“Listen, divine son, to what I say! I will briefly offer A response to these questions
they gathered the finest and best flowers, incense, lamps, perfumes, garlands, ointments, powders, and cloths. Then, blessed as they were with supernatural powers from the ripening of merit and with divine bodies that are mentally created, they instantaneously disappeared from that celestial palace
By means of their celestial powers, they traveled to Kapilavastu, that sublime city with a hundred thousand gardens
and arrived at King Śuddhodana’s residence, known as the Home of the Swans, the great mansion that resembled the palaces of the ruler of the gods
The goddesses, wearing loose gowns
“Just as a king does not leave the place Where he was consecrated by his kinfolk For a duration of seven days, Since that is the duty of kings
were well adorned by the splendor of their immaculate merit
“So also victorious ones, even with the ten powers, When consecrated, their aspirations fulfilled, Remain in the cross-legged position At the center of the earth for seven days
and their arms and hands were full of divine ornaments. They saw Queen Māyā resting on her fine bed
They pointed her out to each other and
The crowns of gods brush your feet
“Just as a warrior stares At vanquished enemy troops, Buddhas too, at the seat of awakening, Stare at the afflictions, now destroyed
“Attachment and anger, born from delusion
Are like the foes of beings
Like thieves with their stolen goods, I have destroyed them here
I relinquished all defilements, And the highest wisdom has dawned in me
“Here the ignorance that drives the thirst for existence And induces inappropriate action
A network of roots including latent formations— Was burned up by the intense fire of wisdom
“Here those enduring deceptions of mine Have at long last ended in destruction
The aggregates, along with the clinging to them, I have discerned through my wisdom
“Here the forest of obscurations Has been burned away by the fire of my roots of virtue
I have utterly burned up The fourfold misconception, too
“The sixty-five travails
The thirty impure delusions
“When I rid myself of pretense and guile, Here I cut down the forest of afflictions That is teeming with deception, stinginess, hatred, and jealousy
“Here, with the sunlight of mindfulness and tranquility, I dried up the ocean of existence, An expanse of craving churned up By the intoxicated crocodiles of the four physical elements
“Here I extinguished, with the cool water of liberation, The great fire of lust, With its billowing smoke of thought Raging through the timber of objects
“Here at the center of the earth, I cut through the entire snare of thirty-six courses of action With the powerful sword of insight, Then burned it up with the fire of wisdom
“Just as Śakra did to the lord of the demigods, Here I destroyed with the sword of wisdom The deceptive one who, self-obsessed, Was powerful enough to rule over the three realms
he began his departure from the sublime realm of the Heaven of Joy
Then, as the bodhisattvas and many millions of gods, nāgas, and yakṣas assembled around him
Likewise many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas, all of them bound by just one more birth
Tell us who this man is! We will bind him with the lasso of desire And lead him like an elephant
“Leading him, we will promptly Bring him under your control
“The Bliss-Gone One is the worthy one of the world
He will never fall under the power of desire
He has gone beyond my range; This is why I grieve so strongly!
Even though the girls had already experienced the deeds of the Bodhisattva and the power of the Thus-Gone One, out of their fickleness they did not listen to their father’s words
The girls then went before their father and said
However, as the Thus-Gone One paid them no heed, they were transformed into decrepit old ladies
They transformed into girls in the prime of youth, who had just reached maturity and, in order to bewilder the Thus-Gone One, they went before him, summoning all their womanly guiles
Go promptly and confess to the Sage the offense that you committed
He will then return your bodies to their previous form as you wish.
Māra, the evil one, told them: “I am not aware of anyone in the animate or inanimate world Who can change what has been done by the Buddha’s power
Father, please do away with these decrepit bodies of ours.
The Thus-Gone One spoke to them with these verses
“Thus I forgive the offense of you girls
Why is that
Because it is an advancement in the training of the noble Dharma to understand a fault to be a fault, to confess it, and to vow to abstain from it henceforth.
The nāga king Mucilinda also bowed his head to the feet of the Thus-Gone One, circumambulated him three times, and then set out for his domain
They then bowed their heads at the feet of the Thus-Gone One, circumambulated him three times, and returned to their respective homes
When seven days had passed, the nāga kings understood that the bad weather had let up, and so they unfurled their bodies from the Thus-Gone One’s body
Those nāga kings had never before known such bliss as during these seven days and seven nights, because of being close to the Thus-Gone One’s body
That pile of nāga kings loomed at a height like that of Meru, king of mountains
O Sage, may you teach the Dharma!
“Beings, bound to their desires, Are continuously swept away in the stream
I discovered this with great effort; Therefore teaching it will not be of any help!
Therefore teaching it will not be of any help
and the lord of the Dharma
the one with mastery over all dharmas
Then he is called a perfectly awakened buddha, the one who naturally manifests, lord of Dharma, the guide, the perfect guide, the complete guide, the captain
He is known as the glory of the world because he possesses all the qualities of the world
Gives up concern for his body and life And recites this sūtra for a single day and night
When the Blessed One, the Exalted Lord, had spoken
the gods from the pure realms headed by Maheśvara; all the bodhisattvas, the great beings, headed by Maitreya
In that house the Thus-Gone One always resides
The result of your practice of patience Is that gods and humans develop loving minds
The result of your practice of diligence Is that your body is beautiful like Mount Meru
“In the past, for billions of eons, You trained in concentration to purify the afflictions
The result of your practice of concentration Is that beings are not harmed by afflictions
“In the past, for billions of eons, You trained in knowledge that destroys the afflictions
The result of your practice of knowledge Is that you emit sublime and beautiful light
“With the armor of compassion, you have destroyed the afflictions And developed great compassion for all beings
You have attained perfect delight and excellent equanimity; Bliss-Gone One, Great Being, homage be to you
“You are exalted by the splendor of the light of the lamp of knowledge And have cleared all darkness of delusion
Homage to you, Able One Who Shows the Path— The leader, the eye in the trichiliocosm
“Skilled in the higher knowledge of the bases of miraculous powers, You see the truth and have trained in the sacred meaning
Having crossed over, you liberate others; Homage to you, the Bliss-Gone One Who Liberates
“Skilled in means and higher knowledge, You show a passing away that is devoid of death and rebirth
Although you act harmoniously in accord with worldly law, You are in no way attracted to the world
“Inconceivably excellent gains come to anyone Who merely comes to hear or see you
So how about those who actually listen to the Dharma And develop faith and joy
But the sun has risen in Jambudvīpa
You will awaken inconceivable trillions of creatures Who are asleep due to their afflictions
“Today the palace will be filled with wonders
It will be crowded with trillions of deities
It will resound with the music played by divine maidens
In the king’s mansion, sweet music will be heard
“The lady is endowed with supreme beauty, Nourished by the brilliance of her merit and virtuous actions
the insides of my chest became visible through both sides of my ribs
My spine appeared uneven and rugged, like a braid of hair with all its ups and downs
Just as a bitter gourd that has been cut too early withers, dries out, and develops cracks, likewise my head began to wither, dry out, and develop cracks
Just like a well during the end of summer, where the reflection of the stars has sunk and is hard to notice, my eyeballs had sunk into my head and become barely visible
My legs resembled the legs of a goat or a camel, and so it was for my armpits, belly, chest, and so forth
Monks, when at that point I tried touching my belly with my hand, I actually ended up touching my spine
I was so hunched over that I fell whenever I tried to stand
When I finally managed to get u
and wipe my dust-covered body with my hands, my decayed hair fell out of my body
Previously my complexion had been beautiful and smooth, but now this radiance was all gone due to exerting myself in harsh travails
The people who lived in the villages surrounding the area where I was practicing began to say
Previously my complexion had been beautiful and smooth, but now this radiance had disappeared because of exerting myself in extreme austerities
When I finally managed to get up with great effort and wipe my dust-covered body with my hands, my body hair, its roots rotten, came out of my body
Monks, whenever I thought I should stand up, I tried to do so, but my body was so hunched over that I fell every time
My eyeballs appeared like stars in a sunken well
My skull looked like a cracked gourd
My spine appeared like a braided tuft of hair
and it looked like a collapsed stable with rafters exposed on either side
My rib cage resembled the sides of a crab
Monks, my limbs and joints gradually became twice, three times, four times, five times, and finally ten times as thin as the knots of the āsītakī and kālā plants
Monks, as I now began living without any sustenance, my body became extremely weak and emaciated
Wherever this jewel of a sūtra is found
The second great merit results in becoming a supreme ruler in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings
The third great merit results in becoming Śakra, lord of the gods
The fourth great merit results in becoming the god Suyāma

“Friends, whoever listens attentively to this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full as it is being explained will gain eight pure mind states

“Friends, wherever this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full is found, whether in a village, a city, a market, an inhabited place, a district, a courtyard, or a temple, the eight fears will not manifest except from the ripening of past actions
“Friends, the discipline, absorption, knowledge, liberation, and wisdom vision of liberation of the Thus-Gone One is immeasurable and boundless
For this reason, my friends, if anyone develops the wish that others receive this vast teaching, and subsequently memorizes this Dharma teaching, carries it, propagates it, writes it down
Other than the ripening of previous actions, my friends, these eight fears will no longer occur
or commissions it to be written
comprehends it, and teaches it elaborately to his congregation, then their merit shall also be boundless.
Then the Thus-Gone One announced to venerable Mahākāśyapa, venerable Ānanda, and the bodhisattva great being Maitreya
“Friends, the unsurpassable and perfect awakening that I have accomplished through limitless billions of eons, I now place in your hands
I entrust you with a supreme entrustment
Now you should keep this teaching with you and teach it elaborately to others.
When he had said this

These are the eight great treasures that one will attain

These are the eight purities of speech that one will attain
By satisfying the sense faculties of all sentient beings, one will have the voice of a Buddha
By not being dominated by any propagators of other doctrines, one will have a voice like the roar of a lion
“Friends, this sūtra known as The Play in Full is a very extensive account of the Bodhisattva’s playful activity
“Friends, whoever sets up a throne for the Dharma teacher who wishes to expound this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full will attain eight desirable positions as soon as he sets up the throne
These are the eight supreme attributes that one will attain
“Friends, whoever joins his palms in respect to this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full will attain eight supreme attributes
Your request to teach this Dharma will become a root of virtue—very valuable, yielding great benefits, and earning great praise
The demons will be destroyed
All those who proclaim different doctrines will not make their appearance
This concludes the twenty-sixth chapter, on turning the wheel of Dharma
Even if one were to speak for an eon, That would not suffice to describe the Buddha’s qualities.
“For the limitless wisdom of the Buddha Is as vast as the sky
This praise of the qualities of the Thus-Gone One Has listed just but a few
“This brief explanation Will set in motion the wheel of Dharma
“I am powerful with the ten powers, Confident with the four confidences, And possessor of the eighteen unique qualities— The great sage who turns the wheel of Dharma of the Supreme Vehicle
“He is called the source of the precious Dharma because he has perfected all the precious teachings that lead to awakening
He is known as the fire-like one because he burns away all disturbing emotions, having given up all pretense
“He is called the master of the world, the one who benefits the world
the one who has perfected generosity, the most sublime through discipline
the all-knowing one
and the one with perfect mindfulness, mode of thinking, and intellect
“He is known as the member of the royal class because he is the only one who carries the jewel parasol
He is the one who possesses the gems of the seven factors of awakening
the one who is transformed through wisdom in every respect, and the one who displays the great dance of Dharma
“For so long he has practiced renunciation, discipline, hardship, and religious practices in a firm and pure manner without wavering or getting weary
“He is the one with a voice like the roar of a lion or a bull
He is the one with a voice that satisfies, because it is in accord with the languages of all sentient beings
He is the one with a voice that delights the circle of his audience without impediment or obstruction
He is the one with a single voice that is understood in all languages
“He is the one who is honored by the lord of the Brahma realm
He is the one who is respected by the lord of the gods
He is the one to whom the lord of the nāgas bows
He is the one upon whose face the lord of the yakṣas gazes
He is the one who the lord of the gandharvas praises in song

“In the truth of suchness, It is the final end, yet it is without an end, This nondual teaching of the Dharma— That is what we call the wheel of Dharma
“The eye is essentially empty, So are the ear and the nose
The tongue, the body, and also the mind Are empty and inert
“Such a wheel is the wheel of Dharma That has now been turned
He awakens unawakened beings; That’s why he is called the Awakened One
“By myself have I realized this nature— The nature defined as Dharma— Without instructions from others, And so I am the self-arisen possessor of the wisdom eye
“The one who masters all Dharmas Is called a lord of Dharma
The one who knows the genuine Dharma from the incorrect, That is what we call a guide
“As many beings as there are to be trained, That many limitless beings I train
I have perfected my training, And so I am called the Perfect Guide
“It is free from existence and nonexistence, Beyond self and no self, A teaching that is naturally unborn— That is what we call the wheel of Dharma
“It is an infinitely vast teaching, Ever equal to space, Luminous and nonconceptual— So is the wheel of Dharma described
“All beings that have strayed from the path, I show the supreme path
I guide them to the other shore, And therefore I am the Guide
“Since I know the way to magnetize, I gather beings at my side
Since I save beings from the wasteland of cyclic existence, I am their leader
I am victorious in all battles
The hero who has conquered disturbing emotions
“The splendorous appearance of this perfect man Will henceforth prevent any greed and quarrels Among beings in this sublime palace
All shall be lovingly reverential
“With the birth in the family of a universal monarch
The royal line will surely prosper
Likewise this city of Kapilavastu will become prosperous And replete with treasures
“Hosts of yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, guhyakas
Gods, and asuras, together with their leaders— All those who stand guard over the supreme man Will soon attain liberation
A liberated one who liberates beings
“Guide, whatever merit accumulates As we praise you with respect and reverence, We dedicate it all to awakening
“I am the light of the world
Best of Men, may we quickly become like you!
I spread the light of knowledge wisdom
This concludes the fifth chapter, on setting out
It was the finest season, when the moon enters the constellation Viśākhā. The leaves of trees unfurled and the most exquisite flowers blossomed. It was neither cold nor hot
and there was no fog or dust in the air. Fresh green grass covered the grounds everywhere
The Lord of the Three Worlds,  revered by all the worlds, now judged that the time had come
I conquer the darkness of ignorance
I hold the torch; I am the bright light
“With great wisdom I am the skillful doctor
A great healer of the wounds of disturbing emotions
For all those afflicted with disturbing emotions
I am the remover of pain
“All the signs are complete, And all the marks of goodness adorn me
Yet, with this body, excellent in every way, I adapt to the ways of the worldly ones
His head was the color of a reddish insect, and the tusks were blazing gold
I am known as a king of Dharma
He had all his limbs intact and his full faculties
“I am the generous giver of the Dharma, the Teacher, The unexcelled Lord of the Dharma
My offering was well performed and the goal accomplished
My aim is fulfilled and goodness accomplished
Since I turn the wheel of Dharma
“I master all phenomena, And so I am the Victorious One, the master of Dharma
As this occurred, Queen Māyā was sleeping on her pleasant bed and saw the following in her dream
A snowy-silver colored elephant with six tusks
Beautiful feet, exquisite trunk, and a pretty red head
Moving in a fine gait with joints as stable as a diamond— That perfect elephant entered her womb
She had never seen, heard of, or experienced Such a rare happiness
Feeling this physical and mental bliss, She became absorbed in concentration
As she awoke, Queen Māyā first adorned herself with ornaments and flowing garments
Refreshed in body and mind
she felt affectionate, joyful, and calm
She then arose from her bed and made her way down from the upper floors of the palace, surrounded by her female attendants
“For so long he has showed respect to parents, monks, priests, spiritual teachers, and worthy ones, addressing them while bowing or prostrating, and protecting them from danger
In fact this wheel had previously been turned by all former thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas, and therefore it was now offered to the Thus-Gone One to turn
Once he had made his offering to the Thus-Gone One, the bodhisattva joined his palms and praised the Thus-Gone One with these verses
“When Dipaṃkara made the prediction for the Pure One, He said, ‘You will become a buddha, a lion among the lions of men.
At that time I made the following aspiration: ‘When I become perfectly enlightened, I will seek the Dharma.
“Today the best of beings have come here from the ten directions, So many in number that they cannot be counted
With joined palms they bow at the Thus-Gone One’s feet And request the joy of the Śākya clan to turn the wheel of Dharma
“Monks, there are two extremes that you should avoid when you have taken ordination
Finally, during the last part of the night, he summoned the five excellent companions and said
During the middle part of the night, he gave an eloquent talk
Monks, the Thus-Gone One now spent the first part of the night in silence
Yet no sound can be heard at this very moment As everyone looks with a peaceful mind to the Victorious One.
“The heavens above this trichiliocosm are filled with gods, And on earth demigods, kiṃnaras, and humans roam
The complete array could never be fully described
“The offerings of the gods at the seat of awakening, And the arrays of the sons of the victorious ones— They all stand together, set forth for the wheel of Dharma
“For so long you increased the six perfections
You performed and amassed an incomparable and immutable wealth of Dharma
As you behold all these beings without protection, wealth, or guidance, Noble Guide, please share the seven types of wealth and turn the wheel
“For a hundred eons you have likewise kept your discipline intact and pure, Always training in patience and with your diligence never waning
Sage, your concentration is supreme and your insight is a clairvoyant wisdom; With your intent fulfilled, please remove the fever and turn the supreme wheel.
It was an exquisite wheel adorned with all kinds of jewels, gems, and various other embellishments. It had a hub, a rim, and a thousand spokes
It was adorned with flower garlands, lattices of gold, tassels with bells, and the motifs of an elephant in rut, a filled vase, and a swastika
The wheel was adorned with various marks of auspiciousness, beautifully wrapped in divine fabrics and dyed in different colors
Since all the previous thus-gone ones in succession had accepted this wheel, it possessed the unbroken blessings of all the buddhas
She proceeded to the aśoka-tree forest, where she felt at ease
Once there, she sent a message to King Śuddhodana
“Your Majesty, please come, the queen would like to see you.
When King Śuddhodana heard this message, he became very elated, and immediately he rose from his throne
Surrounded by his ministers and townspeople, attendants and relatives, he went to the aśoka forest
However, as he arrived, his body suddenly felt very heavy and he was unable to enter the forest
In this way he just stood at the entrance to the aśoka forest. Reflecting a little, he then spoke these verses
“I do not remember my body ever feeling this heavy
Now I cannot even enter my own property
Can anyone tell me what has happened?
Some gods of the pure realms had settled in the middle of the sky. Now they revealed half their bodies and spoke these verses to King Śuddhodana
With qualities of austerity and discipline, honored by the three worlds
Loving and compassionate, and empowered by merit and wisdom
“Your Majesty, a bodhisattva, a great being
Has left the Heaven of Joy for the womb of Queen Māyā in order to become your son.
Then, joining his palms and bowing his head
The king went into the forest, overwhelmed by reverence and awe
Without pride or arrogance, he looked at Queen Māyā And asked
“What may I do for you? Tell me what to do.” The queen replied
“A fine and beautiful elephant, white as snow or silver, More dazzling than the sun and the moon, well proportioned, With beautiful legs, six great tusks, and joints as firm as diamond, Entered my womb—please listen to this story
“In my sleep I saw this trichiliocosm illuminated, its darkness gone, While ten million gods were praising me
I felt no anger, aggression, hatred, or confusion
I felt peaceful and full of the bliss of concentration
“I wonder if this dream of mine shows happiness or sorrow for our family
Is my dream a genuine prediction
Your Majesty, quickly summon the priests Who are specialists in the Vedic treatises on dreams.
When the priests stood before Queen Māyā, she said
“Listen to my story; this is what I dreamed.
The brāhmins replied
“Your Majesty, please speak. When we hear what you saw in your dream, we will explain.
“A fine and beautiful elephant, white as snow or silver, More dazzling than the sun and the moon, well proportioned, With beautiful legs, six great tusks, and joints as firm as diamond, Entered my womb—please listen to this story.
As they heard these words, the priests remarked
“Your clan shall meet no sorrow but only extensive delight
A son will be born to you, his limbs adorned with the marks
He will belong to the lineage of kings, a great universal monarch
“If he renounces his pleasures, his kingdom, and his palace
And goes forth as a monk, unattached, full of compassion and love for the world
He will become a buddha worthy of offerings in the three worlds
He will satisfy the world with the supreme taste of the nectar of immortality.
Following this positive prediction
The priests had their meal in the royal palace
Accepted an offering of gifts
And subsequently departed
Monks, when King Śuddhodana heard that message from the priests who understood how to analyze marks and signs and who knew the scriptures related to dreams
he was satisfied
Impressed
delighted, and joyful
he felt blissful and happy
At the same time, as an offering to the Bodhisattva, alms were distributed at the four gates of the city of Kapilavastu and at all its crossroads and junctions
The king offered food to those who were hungry
and drink to those who were thirsty
He offered clothes to those who needed clothing
carriages to those who required transportation
perfumes to those who desired perfume
garlands to those who wished for garlands
oils to those who wanted ointments
sheets to those who longed for bedding
shelter to the homeless
and necessities to those who yearned for provisions
Then, monks, King Śuddhodana considered
“I wonder in which residence Queen Māyā can stay happily and without affliction?
At that very instant the four great kings approached King Śuddhodana and spoke to him
“Your Majesty, do not worry; remain happily in equanimity
We will prepare a palace for the Bodhisattva.
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, approached King Śuddhodana and spoke to him
“The palaces of the protectors are no good
Those of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three are better
I will give the Bodhisattva a palace Equal to my Vaijayanta.
Then a god from the Heaven Free from Strife approached King Śuddhodana and spoke to him
“When ten million gods of Śakra’s realm See my mansion, they marvel
This glorious house, the best of the Heaven Free from Strife, I give to the king’s son.
Then a god from the Heaven of Joy approached King Śuddhodana and spoke to him
“Previously this renowned being Dwelt in a delightful palace When he was in the Heaven of Joy
That palace I will now offer to the Bodhisattva.
Then a god from the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations approached King Śuddhodana and spoke to him
“A glorious, mentally created mansion That is made of jewels
I will give to the Bodhisattva, king, As an act of worship.
Then a god from the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations approached King Śuddhodana and spoke to him
Monks, in this way each of the eminent gods of the desire realm individually presented their respective residences as an offering to the Bodhisattva, right there in the fine city of Kapilavastu
There the queen may remain.
Your Majesty, I will bring My beautiful jewel palace
“It is strewn with divine flowers And scented with divine perfumes. I will offer this spacious palace
“So let me give that glorious mansion As an offering to the Bodhisattva
“The resplendence of my mansion Eclipses the light and colors Of any beautiful mansion Anywhere in the desire realm
King Śuddhodana also provided an excellent mansion. It far surpassed those built by other humans, although it could not match the divine palaces
However, by the power of the Bodhisattva resting in the absorption known as the great array, Queen Māyā appeared in all of those residences
During the period when the Bodhisattva stayed in Queen Māyā’s womb
he remained on the right side of the womb, seated in a cross-legged posture
In addition all the chief gods believed that the mother of the Bodhisattva remained only in the residence they had given her, and not anywhere else
On this topic, it is said
While the Bodhisattva remained in the absorption known as the great array, He emanated inconceivable magical displays, Which perfectly fulfilled the wishes of all the gods
The wishes of the king, too, became fulfilled
Then some gods among the assembly began to wonder
“Even the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings turn back when they approach human habitations
So what about the gods of the highest order—those in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
the Heaven Free from Strife, or the Heaven of Joy
How could the pure Bodhisattva, who is free from bad-smelling odors
superior to the entire world, a jewel among beings, transmigrate from the divine realm of the Heaven of Joy and remain for ten months in the foul-smelling human body inside his mother’s womb?
Then at that time, by the power of the Buddha, venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One
But at these words the Thus-Gone One remained silent
Then Great Top-Knotted Brahmā said to Śakra, lord of the gods
“O Kauśika, venerable, perfectly and completely awakened thus-gone ones are not requested to turn the wheel of Dharma the way you requested it.
So Great Top-Knotted Brahmā draped his robe on one shoulder, knelt on his right knee
and bowing down to the Thus-Gone One with palms joined, spoke this verse to him
“May you rise, O Victor in Battle! May you shine the light of insight in this dark world! Beings will become knowledgeable
And so the Thus-Gone One had thrice made up his mind to remain disinterested
Monks, at that time all sorts of negative, inauspicious opinions started to circulate among the people of Magadha
Some said that winds would no longer blow, and some that fires would no longer burn
Some said that birds would no longer fly in the sky, and some that pregnant women would no longer give birth safely
Monks, the Great Top-Knotted Brahmā knew the nature of the Thus-Gone One’s thoughts, and he was aware of the opinions among the people of Magadha
So, at the close of night
he illuminated the entire area surrounding the fig tree with divine light beautiful in color, and he approached the Thus-Gone One. When he arrived
he bowed his head to the feet of the Thus-Gone One
draped his robe on one shoulder
knelt down on his right knee, and bending forward with palms joined, spoke in verse to the Thus-Gone One
“Previously in Magadha, the Dharma was impure, Therefore impurely construed talk has emerged there
Thus, please, O Sage, open the gate of nectar
They are ready to listen to the stainless Buddhadharma
“With your goal accomplished, you reached independence
Having removed the stain of the formation of suffering
Your virtue is without increase or decrease
Here in the best Dharma, you have reached perfection
“O Sage, there is no one like you here in this world
O Great Sage, how could you be surpassed
Being the best, you shine here in the three worlds
O Lord, Like the mountain in the realm of the demigods
“Please have mercy on suffering beings
It is never fitting for those like you to remain indifferent
You are endowed with fearlessness and power
Only you are able to deliver beings
They have no other refuge here
Victorious guides appear on this earth only rarely, Like an uḍumbara flower
“O Sage, clear away the darkness with the lamp of Dharma
Raise high the banner of the Thus-Gone One
The time has come to utter melodious speech
I beg you to resound like a lion, O You of Drum-like Voice!
Fulfill your solemn vow, you with the dynamic power of truth
“The blind, who without a guide have fallen into ravines, Cannot be led out by anyone else here
Tell of the straight path, free of brambles, By which nectar is attained when meditating upon it
“Long lost, people roam throughout existence Thick with wrong views and full of thorns
Like a cloud over parched earth, O Guide, satiate them with the rain of Dharma
one that was sure to be wrong, one that was sure to be correct, and one was undetermined
Monks, the Thus-Gone One thought
“Whether I teach the Dharma or not, this group that is sure to be wrong will not understand the Dharma
And whether I teach the Dharma or not, this group that is sure to be correct will understand the Dharma
Yet the group that is undetermined will understand the Dharma if I teach it
but will not understand the Dharma if I do not teach it.
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then engendered great compassion, starting with the sentient beings situated in the undetermined group
Monks, from the perspective of his own perfect wisdom, the Thus-Gone One then understood the request made by Great Top-Knotted Brahmā and thus spoke to him with this verse
“O Brahmā, the gates of nectar are opened To those sentient beings of Magadha With ears and with devotion, Who constantly listen with attention and without doing harm.
Once Great Top-Knotted Brahmā understood that the Thus-Gone One had acquiesced, he rejoiced with satisfaction and glee
Monks, at that point the Thus-Gone One had accomplished everything he had to do
Thus I too will turn the sublime wheel in the supreme grove named after the sages.
“I remember that  billion previous buddhas Turned the sublime wheel in that supreme grove named after the sages
Where peace, tranquility, and concentration are actualized, and deer always dwell
This place, exalted by gods and nāgas, is ever inspiring for Dharma
Vārāṇasī was the preferred place of the previous sages
I made offerings to sixty trillion buddhas there
And why
“I performed sixty trillion sacrifices there
But the Thus-Gone One replied
“Do not say such a thing, good sirs
May the Blessed One please turn the wheel of Dharma in one of these other places!
There are other big cities, O Blessed One, that are wealthy, flourishing, secure, and pleasant, with abundant provisions
and the Deer Park has only a limited amount of tree shade
“O Blessed One, the city of Vārāṇasī has merely a limited population
They said
“Where will the Blessed One turn the wheel of Dharma?
All negative emotions had been cleared away, along with his mental stains
He had conquered Māra and all hostile forces, an
now he joined the Dharma-way of all awakened ones
He had become omniscient and perceived everything
He possessed the ten powers and had discovered the fourfold fearlessness
All the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha had unfolded within him
Equipped with the fivefold vision
he surveyed the entire world with the unobscured eye of an awakened one and began to reflect
“To whom should I teach this Dharma for the very first time
Who has little desire, anger, and delusion
Who is pure, kindhearted, easy to train, and a good teacher able to purify others
Who is open-minded and suffers because of never having heard the Dharma
Such a person I should teach first of all
One who understands my teaching will not turn against me.
Then, monks, the Thus-Gone One thought to himself
“Rudraka, the son of Rāma, is pure and kindhearted
It is easy for him to make others understand and purify them. He has only little desire, anger, or delusion
He is also open-minded, and now suffers because he has never heard the Dharma
He instructs his students in the practice of disciplined conduct that leads to a state of mind that is neither conscious nor unconscious
Now, where is he staying?
At that moment the Thus-Gone One realized that Rudraka had died just one week before
The gods, too, bowed their heads to the Thus-Gone One’s feet and said
Monks, at that point I had the thought
“Oh no, how sad that Rudraka, the son of Rāma, died before hearing this well-prepared teaching
If only he had received my teaching, he would surely have understood it
They will understand the Dharma taught by me, and they will not turn against me.
When I was practicing under hardships, they helped me
They have but little desire, anger, or delusion
“My five ascetic companions are pure and goodhearted. They will make good teachers who are able to purify others
“Lord, that is how it is
Bliss-Gone One, that is how it is
The gods from the pure realms further clarified that matter for the Thus-Gone One, saying
Monks, at that point the Thus-Gone One decided, “My five ascetic companions will be the ones to whom I shall teach the Dharma for the first time!
They would be open-minded, and they are now suffering because of not having heard the Dharma
“What other being is pure, has a good heart and all the qualities, and would not react against my presentation of the Dharma?” Monks, it then occurred to the Thus-Gone One
“Oh no, how sad that Ārāḍa Kālāma died before hearing this well-prepared teaching!” Monks, at that point the Thus-Gone One once again reflected
Ārāḍa Kālāma died just three days ago.” The Thus-Gone One then thought
Wondering, he realized that Ārāḍa Kālāma had passed away just three days earlier
Monks, the Thus-Gone One now further thought
“Where might these five companions be staying?
Scanning the entire world with his eye of an awakened one, he saw the five ascetics staying in the Deer Park in Vārāṇasī by a hill known as the Hill of the Fallen Sages
After seeing this, he thought to himself
“If I teach these five excellent ascetics the Dharma before I teach anyone else
they will understand my Dharma when I teach it for the very first time.
They are intent on the path to liberation and are free from obstructing forces
Now, monks, having reflected in this way, the Thus-Gone One arose from the seat of awakening, making the trichiliocosm tremble
In Gaya, not far from the seat of awakening, an Ājīvika mendicant spotted him from afar
In due course, passing through the country of Magadha, he set off on his way to Kāśi
Seeing the Thus-Gone One approaching, he came up to him and stood to one side
As he stood to one side
monks, the Ājīvika first made a pleasing conversation about various things with the Thus-Gone One, saying
“Venerable Gautama, your senses are calm, and your skin is bright, pure, and of yellow hue
Just as the autumn season, which is white and bright, becomes of yellow hue, so too your senses, Lord Gautama, are bright, and your round face is perfectly pure
just so, Venerable Gautama, are your calmed senses, bright skin color, and your perfectly pure round face
when well fashioned by a skillful son of a goldsmith and thrown onto a white cloth becomes of vivid color, resplendent, perfectly pure, and exceedingly bright
Venerable Gautama, with whom did you practice religion?
Monks, the Thus-Gone One replied to the Ājīvika with this verse
“I do not have any teacher
There is no one like me
I alone am the perfect Buddha
Cool and without any flaws.
The seeker asked further, “Gautama, surely you are not telling me that you have become a victorious one?
The seeker then asked, “Gautama, surely you are not telling me that you have become a worthy one?
Monks, in this way the Thus-Gone One traveled through the land. Finally he arrived at the city of Vārāṇasī
When King Bimbisāra heard this, he waived the crossing fee for monks from that day onward
Monks, at that time the great river Ganges was swollen and flowed on the same level as its banks
In due course he arrived at the banks of the great river Ganges
Monks, in all those places the laypeople invited the Thus-Gone One to stay and refresh himself
Monks, at this point Sudarśana, the king of the nāgas, invited the Thus-Gone One to stay with him in Gaya for some refreshments
The Thus-Gone One then proceeded to Rohitavastu and on toward Uruvela-Kalpa, Anāla, and the town of Sārathi
“May this come to pass, Gautama!” replied the Ājīvika
“May this come to pass!” The mendicant then took off toward the south while the Thus-Gone One went north
He then proceeded to the Hill of the Fallen Sages at the Deer Park to meet his five former companions
Then he entered the city of Vārāṇasī to seek alms
Soon he had acquired enough offerings and sat down for his meal
Before, when he practiced austerities, he never managed to manifest any deep wisdom derived from the teachings of superior humans
Monks, the closer the Thus-Gone One came to his five former companions, the more uncomfortable they felt in their seats and wanted to stand up
They felt like birds caught in a cage with a fire burning below
Just as birds tormented by a fire wish nothing more than to take off quickly and fly away, the closer the Thus-Gone One came to the five companions, the more uncomfortable they felt in their seats and wanted to get up
The reason they felt this way is that no living being is able to remain seated when beholding the Thus-Gone One
“I am the one who consoles and gives comfort
If I were to teach this truth
and if others did not comprehend it, this would be harmful to me
Thus I will most certainly continue to keep it to myself.
Monks, by the power of the Buddha
“Understand, Kauśika
that the venerable, perfectly and completely awakened Thus-Gone One is bent on not teaching the Dharma and thus keeping it to himself
And since the worthy one, the perfectly and completely awakened Thus-Gone One, is bent on not teaching the Dharma and thus keeping it to himself
alas, O Kauśika, this world is doomed! Alas
O Kauśika, this world is really doomed
Alas, this world will be plunged into the great darkness of ignorance
Why don’t we then go and request that the worthy one, the perfectly and completely awakened Thus-Gone One, turn the wheel of Dharma
Because the thus-gone ones do not turn the wheel of Dharma without being requested!
“Very well, my friend!
Swiftly shower down the rain of true Dharma throughout the three worlds.
He had vanquished the demonic opponents
raised parasols, standards, and flags, and become a hero, a supreme victor, a man, a great man, a supreme physician, and a great remover of thorns
Like a lion, he was fearless and without worry
Like an elephant, he was gentle
Since he had relinquished the three stains, he was stainless
He was knowledgeable, since he had actualized the threefold knowledge
He had reached the other shore, since he had crossed the four rivers
He was of royal caste since he upheld the single jewel parasol
a priest of the three worlds since he had abandoned evil actions
a mendicant since he has cracked open the eggshell of ignorance
an ascetic since he had perfectly transcended all attachment
a gentleman since he had eradicated afflictions
a hero since he did not let the banner fall
a powerhouse since he was endowed with the ten powers
a jewel mine since he was replete with all the gems of the Dharma
Knowing this, the goddesses approached the seat of awakening and praised the Thus-Gone One with these verses
“The hair between his eyebrows radiates light
Illuminating many tens of millions of locales
Outshining even the sun and the moon
He is a light unto all sentient beings
“His form is handsome— Sublime and well-proportioned
Replete with the best of characteristics and poised to be of benefit
It is worthy of reverence throughout the three worlds
“His eyes are pristine
They spontaneously see The myriad insentient and sentient, The locales and multitudes of beings
“His ears are pristine
They hear infinite sounds, Those of gods and humans And those of the victorious ones’ Dharma
“His tongue is long And as melodious as a cuckoo’s voice
Let us listen to him speak about the Dharma, An ambrosia that brings great peace
“Even witnessing Māra’s army, His mind is unperturbed
Even seeing the multitudes of gods, His sensible mind is not ecstatic
“It was not with knives and arrows That he defeated Māra’s army
Rather it was with truth, restraint, and austerity That he overcame the villainous thugs
“Without being displaced from his seat, His body was unharmed
On that occasion he was neither affectionate Nor even angry
“Those gods and humans Who listen to the Dharma from you, And strive to accomplish it, Procure their desired acquisition
Extending his hand, he said to the bodhisattvas
“Respect has been paid, thus return to your own places.
All of them bowed to the feet of the Thus-Gone One And returned to their own abodes, in magnificent arrays
Monks, even while the Thus-Gone One reached perfect and complete awakening seated on his lion’s throne at the trunk of the tree of awakening
he simultaneously manifested such innumerable displays of awakened playful activity that they would not be easy to reveal even in an eon
After witnessing the great demonic horde advancing And the Bliss-Gone One toying auspiciously with them
Beings, out of an unparalleled wish to reach awakening, said: “May we vanquish Māra and his horde, and thus reach the deathless state.
Who could get enough of working for the welfare of beings?
Who could get enough of dwelling in deserted forests
Who could be satiated with listening to ambrosia-like Dharma
“Thus who could get their fill of making merit
Hundreds of billions of realms trembled and Māra was vanquished
Once the guide, a bull among men, had awakened to buddhahood
“Through the merit of praising you, O Victorious One, replete with the resplendence of merit, May we all immediately become like you, O Moon among Men!
Then, in the cadence of Brahmā and the melody of a cuckoo, The Guide first spoke these verses
“Merit, fully ripened, brings happiness and vanquishes all suffering
The wishes of a person with merit will be accomplished
They will overcome Māra, quickly reach awakening, And attain nirvāṇa, the tranquil state of peace
On this topic, it is said
The earth became as even as the palm of a hand
Hundred-petaled lotuses in full bloom arose in a flood of light
Hundreds of thousands of gods bowed down to the seat of awakening And witnessed there the One Who Was First Heralded by a Lion’s Roar
Hundreds of trees in the trichiliocosm and also its mountains
Along with Meru, king of mountains, bowed to the seat of awakening
Approaching the one with the ten powers, Brahmā and Śakra paid homage
Such was the play of the Lion among Men while at the seat of awakening
Hundreds of thousands of light rays radiated from his body, Pervading the perfect realms of the victorious ones and pacifying the three lower realms
Through this, the unfortunate states were dried up in a mere fraction of an instant, And hardness, conceit, and hatred were rendered harmless to any sentient being
By touching the earth with the palm of his hand, it trembled in six ways
This shook Māra’s hordes as if they were tufts of cotton
Māra, brandishing an arrow, etched images in the earth
Exaltation. Then the gods from the pure realms circumambulated the Thus-Gone One, who sat at the seat of awakening
They showered him with a rain of divine sandalwood powder and praised him with these fitting verses
“You are a light that has dawned upon this world
Illuminating Lord of the World
You have given eyes for abandoning afflictions To this world gone blind
“You are victorious in battle
Through merit you have fulfilled your aim
Replete with virtuous qualities
You will satisfy beings
“Sinless, you have crossed the mire And stand on dry ground, O Gautama! You will ferry across other sentient beings
Who are carried away by the swift current! “Your great insight exalts you! You are without peer throughout the worlds
Such was the play of the Lion among Men while he sat in his seat. The resplendent tuft of hair on his forehead Outshone the radiance of the sun, moon, jewels, fire, lightning, and gods
And the crown of the Teacher’s head was not beheld by any being whatsoever. Such was the play of the Lion among Men while he sat in his seat
You are untainted by mundane concerns, Like a lotus floating on water
“Now that you have appeared, O Lord, The unfortunate states will become vacant! Gods and humans Will become filled with happiness
“As they sever the bonds of affliction, They will all be free of clinging And swiftly become liberated, And thus attain the fruition of supreme virtue
“They will be objects of generosity in the world
Worthy of receiving gifts
Donations to them will not diminish, But become causes for all beings to reach nirvāṇa!
Monks, once the gods from the realm of the pure realms had praised the Thus-Gone One in this manner, they prostrated to the Thus-Gone One with palms joined and stood to one side
“Your mind is profound, O Sage, and your voice is sweet
O Supreme Sage, your song-like voice is melodious like Brahmā’s
You are the compassionate and loving lord of this world
You are the supreme physician, remover of thorns
You are the healer who brings sublime benefit
“As soon as you saw Buddha Dīpaṃkara
You have discovered the absolute awakening, most sublime! Homage to you, who has reached the culmination of all melodious tunes! “You are protection, an island, the highest goal
You attained the cloud masses of love and compassion
Quell the torment of gods and humans
Release a torrential downpour of ambrosia, O Lord
“Like a lotus you are untainted by the three worlds
Like Meru you are immovable and unshakable
Like a vajra your pledge is unwavering
Like the moon you are replete with the best of all qualities!
They circumambulated him three times, then praised him with these fitting verses
“With your virtuous and stainless insight, you radiate and shine
You are replete with the thirty-two most sublime characteristics
Attentive and intelligent, you possess wisdom
Tireless One, to you we bow down
“Utterly devoid of the three stains, you are stainless and pure
Renowned throughout the three worlds, discoverer of the threefold knowledge
You bestow insight into the threefold liberation
We bow to you who possesses the three stainless eyes
“You have banished this foul dark eon, you of well-restrained mind
Exalted in compassion and love, you work for the welfare of beings
Sage Exalted in Joy, your mind is tranquil
Deliverer from Doubt, you delight in impartiality
“Exalted in discipline and austerity, you act for the welfare of beings
Having purified your own conduct, you have reached the culmination of conduct
As the teacher of the four truths, you delight in emancipation
Being liberated yourself, you liberate other beings as well
“When Māra, powerful and persistent, arrived, You defeated him with your insight, diligence, and love, And then you attained the deathless supreme state
Vanquisher of the Villainous Hordes, to you we pay homage!
You illuminate darkness everywhere in the world
“Here, after triumphing through the power of love, I drank the elixir of nectar, For the sake of which Those with the ten powers had cultivated love for all beings
“Here, having triumphed through the power of compassion, I drank the elixir of nectar, For the sake of which Those with the ten powers cultivated compassion for all beings
“Here, having triumphed through the power of joy, I drank the elixir of nectar, For the sake of which Those with the ten powers cultivated joy for all beings
“Here, having triumphed through the power of impartiality, I drank the elixir of nectar, For the sake of which Those with the ten powers cultivated impartiality for myriad eons
“Here I drank the elixir of nectar That has been drunk by those with the ten powers, The victorious lions of yore, More numerous than the sand in the river Ganges
Yet here I drank the elixir of nectar, Truly free of error
“What sets the errant gods and humans aflame Are their misconceptions
I attained the threefold knowledge, Then remembered immeasurable myriad eons, As if waking from sleep
“Here I recollected my former lives
“Here I have purified the eye most sublime By which I see all worlds, Like fruit placed In the palm of the hand
“Here I realized The dependently arisen world to be empty, Reoccurring in each moment of cognition Like a mirage, or a city of gandharvas
“Here I have realized the nectar, For the sake of which I gave up my own flesh, my eyes, and many precious jewels For billions of eons
Having bound and burned them up, I have ensured that they can no longer appear
“Here I have realized The great enemies within, in all their multitudes
“The words that I said Before Māra and his army were: ‘I will not get out of the cross-legged position Until I bring an end to old age and death.
“I attained the level of a worthy one, Exhausted all of my defilements, And destroyed the demon horde
Now I get out of the cross-legged posture.
The assemblies of gods, using jewel pitchers Filled with differently scented waters
Washed the friend of the world, Who reached the culmination of qualities and the ten powers
Billions of gods, Along with myriad apsarases
Performed an immeasurable worship service, With thousands of musical instruments all around
Divine sons, it is thus Reasonable, logical, and well grounded Why victorious ones do not leave their cross-legged position At the center of the earth for seven days
“I destroyed ignorance With blazing, vajra-hard wisdom, And attained the state of the ten powers. That is why I now abandon the cross-legged posture
Monks, to these words of Māra the evil one, the Thus-Gone One replied
Evil one, I will not pass away until all four of my assemblies become restrained, lucid, proficient, and courageous, and can teach the Dharma in conjunction with miracles.
“Since the time has now come for the Blessed One to pass into parinirvāṇa, may the Blessed One pass into parinirvāṇa! May the Bliss-Gone One pass into parinirvāṇa!
Then Māra, the evil one, approached the Thus-Gone One and said
Then, during the fourth week, the Thus-Gone One took a walk, but not as far, this time traveling from the eastern ocean to the western ocean
“It is indeed true what you said, father: ‘He is not swayed by desire; He has gone beyond my range
This is why I grieve so strongly!’ “The form that we manifested to destroy Gautama Would have broken his heart, Had he only seen it
were a bodhisattva in the past, you moved from the divine realm of the Heaven of Joy and entered your mother, remaining in a human body on the right side of the womb
“Since even these two animals will not move, there certainly must be some threat up ahead.
Thus they dispatched scouts on horseback
The Blessed One asked
“Ānanda, would you like to see the jeweled structure that the Bodhisattva delighted in? The one that became the Bodhisattva’s delight as he stayed in his mother’s womb?
Ānanda replied, “Yes please, Blessed One, right away
Bliss-Gone One, now would be a perfect time
When the scouts returned, they reported, “There is no threat whatsoever.
The goddess then revealed her form and consoled the members of the caravan, saying, “Do not fear!
Now the two bullocks could lead the carts to where the Thus-Gone One was
If the Thus-Gone One should reveal the Bodhisattva’s delight, it would be a great pleasure to witness it.
When they arrived, they saw the Thus-Gone One blazing like the god of fire, well adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being, shining with splendor, like the sun just after dawn
Seeing him, the merchants were amazed and thought
Then, through the Blessed One’s doing, Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, disappeared from the Brahma Realm together with six million eight hundred thousand gods of that same realm
“Is this Brahmā who has come here
They all appeared in the presence of the Blessed One
Or is it Śakra, lord of the gods
Or is it Vaiśravaṇa
or perhaps the sun or the moon
Or is it some mountain god
or some river god?
Then Brahmā stood to one side, bowing to the Blessed One
Although the Blessed One knew already, he asked Brahmā, the lord of the Sahā world
They had in fact developed devotion to him, and so they said among themselves
“Brahmā, did you remove the structure that delighted me in the past when I was a bodhisattva and stayed for ten months in my mother’s womb?
Brahmā replied, “Yes, Blessed One. Indeed, Bliss-Gone One.” “Well, Brahmā,” the Blessed One inquired, “where is it now?
Brahmā responded, “Blessed One, it is in the Brahma realm.
What has happened?
Shocked and frightened, the members of the caravan thought, “Why have the carriages stopped here on this plain
Even with everyone making great effort, the carts would move no farther
“In that case, Brahmā,” directed the Blessed One, “fetch this structure that delighted me as a bodhisattva for ten months and show it to everyone so they can know how it was constructed.
Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, now spoke to the gods of the Brahma realm, saying
All the parts of the carriages, such as the harnesses and the rest, tore and split, and the wheels of the carriages sunk into the ground up to their axles
“Please wait here until I bring the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva.
When this caravan of merchants approached the Bodhi tree, a goddess who lived in a forest of milk trees enchanted all the carriages, thus rendering them motionless
They could not be goaded by a whip, but only by handfuls of lotus flowers, or garlands of jasmine flowers
They too coiled their bodies around the Thus-Gone One’s body seven times and shielded him with their hoods
Just like the nāga kings from the east, nāga kings from the south, west, and north  also came, worried that the cold and wind might harm the Thus-Gone One’s body
Then Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, prostrated with his head at the feet of the Blessed One before disappearing from the presence of the Blessed One. In that very instant he reached the Brahma realm
There he spoke these words to the god Subrahmā
“Friend, go from this Brahma realm up to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and tell them
Monks, at that time the Thus-Gone One spoke these meaningful words
‘We are bringing the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva and we are taking it into the presence of the Blessed One. Those among you who would like to see it should come quickly!’ 
Happy is the abstention from injury, in this world, Of the one restrained toward living beings
“Happy is the solitude of the contented one Who has heard the Dharma and can see
“Happy is the freedom from desire That transcends evil
Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, together with  trillion gods, lifted the jeweled structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva and placed it atop a great mansion in the Brahma realm that was three hundred leagues high
Surrounded by all these many trillions of gods
he then descended back down to Jambudvīpa
“This world is tormented By sounds, sensations, tastes, forms, and smells
At that time there was a great gathering of gods from the desire realm who wished to serve the Bodhisattva
Monks, seeing the world ablaze with birth, old age, sickness, death, anguish, lamentation, suffering, discontent, and strife, the Thus-Gone One next uttered this meaningful verse
Even while frightened of existence, Due to craving after existence, beings continue to pursue existence.
During the seventh week, the Thus-Gone One sat at the trunk of a bodhi tree
They asked him, “Blessed One, did Gautama fare happily during the unseasonable seven-day storm?
During that time, two learned and clever merchant brothers from the north, Trapuṣa and Bhallika, were traveling back from the south, after having gained much profit, with a caravan of five hundred fully loaded carts carrying many kinds of merchandise
“There is honey, gruel, and stripped sugar cane.
So, carrying the honey, gruel, and stripped sugar cane
they went to where the Thus-Gone One was seated, bowed down their heads to his feet, circumambulated him three times, and stood to one side
Then they requested the Thus-Gone One, “Please regard us with compassion and accept these alms!
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then wondered
Monks, knowing that it was time for the Thus-Gone One to eat, at that very moment the four great kings appeared from the four directions carrying four golden alms bowls
They offered them to the Thus-Gone One, saying to him, “Please regard us with compassion and accept these four golden alms bowls!
Thinking, however, that those bowls were not appropriate for a monk, the Thus-Gone One did not accept them
Why was that? Among the gods, those of the Brahma realm have the greatest ability
So the four kings came back with four alms bowls made of silver, four made of beryl, four made of quartz, four made of coral, four made of emerald, and four made of every gem
So what need is there to speak of Śakra, master of the gods
At that moment the Blessed One quieted the divine music because the humans in Jambudvīpa would all go insane merely from hearing such music
The four great kings now came before Śakra, lord of the gods, and asked him
the Blessed One uttered the following verses in order to pass on his Dharma teaching more fully
“If the beings whom I see with my buddha-eye Were all worthy ones equal to Śāriputra
And if someone would make, for millions of eons, Offerings to them, equal in number to sand grains in the Ganges
“If all sentient beings were buddhas
For many eons, with many kinds of offerings
And someone were to worship as just explained, With divine flowers and the most precious flowers of this world
And thus attain limitless eloquence and virtue
“Whoever hears this teaching and puts it into practice Shall not only be an unsurpassable guide of humans
But a being without equal, Inexhaustible like the ocean.
calm abiding through actualizing all meditative states and equilibriums
“Friends, what can I do?” Śakra responded
“Lord of the gods, what can we do? We are unable to see this jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva.
“I also cannot see it right now
Nevertheless, friends, when it is brought into the presence of the Blessed One, we should be able to see it.
The four great kings pleaded, “Lord of the gods, for that reason let us quickly do whatever is necessary to see it!
Suddenly Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, arrived together with  trillion gods, carrying the jeweled structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva and bringing it in front of the Thus-Gone One
“Having defeated the demon hordes At the trunk of the king of trees
He sits there unshakable like Mount Meru, Fearless and silent
“Through practicing generosity, discipline, and restraint For many tens of millions of eons, He attained perfect sublime awakening And therefore shines here today
beliefs were eradicated
At the top was a beautifully adorned upper floor scaled to fit a six-month-old fetus
Inside that upper chamber was a throne with a sitting area that was likewise scaled to fit a six-month-old fetus
that is similar in color and shape to the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva
He discovered the means to complete liberation and entered the city of omniscience
where he mingled perfectly with all buddhas and became inseparable from the comprehension of the realm of phenomena
When the gods saw it, their eyes were dazzled and they were amazed
When it was placed in the presence of the Thus-Gone One, it gleamed, radiated heat, and shone brightly
and the medicinal concoction of immortality was employed
He became the king of physicians
who would liberate beings from all suffering and establish them in the bliss of nirvāṇa
he took his seat on the magnificent royal throne of the thus-gone ones, the essence of the thus-gone ones
the cure for the illnesses of sentient beings was comprehended
the conduct of sentient beings was understood
This multistoried structure was as resplendent as gold that has been smelted twice by an expert goldsmith so that it has become perfectly refined and free of any impurity
the faculties of sentient beings were seen in all their variety
the throne inside the structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva
except perhaps the neck of the Bodhisattva, which resembles a conch in shape and color
Even the garments worn by the great Brahmā lost their beauty in front of the Bodhisattva’s throne, causing them to resemble cast-off black blankets that have been beaten by wind and rain
All the worlds throughout the ten directions shook in six ways
they quivered, trembled, and quaked, wobbled, rocked, and swayed; they vibrated, shuddered, and reeled, rattled, shook, and convulsed; they clattered, rattled, and clanged, boomed, thundered, and roared
All the buddhas offered congratulations to the Thus-Gone One for reaching perfect and complete awakening and conferred upon him religious gifts
With these religious gifts, this trichiliocosm became covered with a jewel parasol, and from that jewel parasol issued forth a network of light rays
“An adept among beings, a lotus on the lake of wisdom, has appeared
Untainted by mundane concerns
He will cause a cloud of great compassion to mass
Which will shower throughout the realm of phenomena
On this topic, it is said
Since he defeated Māra, along with his hordes, he is indeed a lion among men
When this teacher actualized the bliss of concentration And attained the threefold knowledge by means of the tenfold power
Many tens of millions of buddha realms throughout the ten directions trembled
Those bodhisattvas who had previously come desiring the Dharma Bowed before his feet and said, “Are you not tired
We have witnessed the army, as terrifying it was, Vanquished by the strength of your insight, merit, and diligence.
The temple was made from uraga sandalwood, which is so precious that a single mote of its dust is equal in value to a thousand universes
Furthermore the temple was surrounded on all sides by more such uraga sandalwood
Inside that temple hovered an identical second structure, which did not touch the first structure
Inside this second temple hovered  an identical third structure, which also did not touch the second structure
Within that third temple made of incense was a throne with cushions
The color of the uraga sandalwood was like the finest blue beryl
Around the temple of incense were all types of flowers that surpassed even those of the gods. They had not been planted there, but appeared solely because of the maturation of the Bodhisattva’s previous basic virtue
That precious structure that delighted the Bodhisattva was like a diamond—solid, firm, and indestructible. Yet it was also pleasant to the touch, like kācilindika cloth
Moreover, the precious structure that delighted the Bodhisattva clearly reflected all that is found within the abodes of the gods of the desire realm
On the evening in which the Bodhisattva entered the womb, a lotus appeared from below the waters
piercing the earth and rising up six million eight hundred thousand leagues, as far as the Brahma realm
They offered them to the Thus-Gone One, but he declined, thinking that these were all inappropriate for a monk
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then wondered what kind of alms bowls the previous thus-gone ones had used to accept alms
“Friends, when the gods of the blue class gave us four stone alms bowls
we thought that they were for our use
But a god of the blue realm called Vairocana told us the following
“ ‘Listen, these alms bowls are not to be used
A victorious one called Śākyamuni will appear; Offer these alms bowls to him!
“He is a vessel made of Dharma and is indestructible, While these vessels, made of stone, are destructible
He will be unable to accept another bowl; Let’s go so that he can accept them!
A path that the lords Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kāśyapa also traversed, Since in your footsteps stainless and perfect lotuses spring forth, breaking out of the earth
Onto which you tread with powerful steps, today you will become a worthy one
Monks, the Bodhisattva saw that Rudraka, the son of Rāma, was in charge of a group, indeed a large group
There are others who practice living like an ox, a deer, a dog, a pig, a monkey, or an elephant
There are some who only stand, some who don’t talk, and some who hold the vīrāsana body posture
Some live on just one mouthful of food, or anything up to seven mouthfuls
Some eat only once a day, some eat once every twenty-four hours, while others eat every four or five or six days
Others fast for a fortnight or a month, according to the moon
Some sleep on a stool or in the water, while others sleep in ashes, on rocks, gravel, planks, thorns, grass, or sticks
Others live in villages or remote places
There are others who wash and eat the leftovers that swans and pigeons throw away
“Some consume roots, fruits, water plants, kuśa grass, leaves, cow dung, cow urine, milk, yogurt, butter, molasses, or seeds that have not been ground
and take their nourishment from one or three or five or seven houses
refrain from wine and beverages and even water
spend the summer indoors
abstain from eating meat and fish
Since I am wholly dedicated to renunciation, I will stay here.
Others sleep with their heads toward the ground, in squatting posture, or on the bare ground
There are some who wear one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more pieces of clothing, while others go naked
There are some who have a ritual of bathing, and others who make a ritual out of never bathing
“They also take refuge in the elements, such as earth, water, fire, wind, and space
Likewise they resort for refuge in mountains, rivers, sources of rivers, lakes, ponds, pools, oceans, reservoirs, lotus ponds, and wells; trees, bushes, vines, grass, tree trunks; cow pens, cemeteries, crossroads where four roads meet, and markets
Whoever gives this sūtra to others or recites just a single word
For millions of eons he shall never stray Either from its words or its meaning
This is the king of all good advice Given by all thus-gone ones
Whoever wishes to venerate the guides, And likewise the solitary buddhas and the listeners, Should give steady rise to the mind of awakening And always keep this sūtra firmly in mind
If someone, at the time when the sacred Dharma is degenerating
That merit would be greatly surpasse
That merit would be greatly surpassed If someone were to offer a single thus-gone one A single prostration accompanied by a devoted attitude And say, ‘Homage to the Worthy One!
If all sentient beings were solitary buddhas, And someone were to offer with great attention Flowers, perfumes, and ointments Continually over several eons
The merit of this would be surpassed If one would joyfully make offerings of garlands and the like To a single solitary buddha, Even for just a single day and night
compassion in order to abandon all ill will
sympathetic joy in order to clear away all depression
equanimity in order to abandon desire and anger
Some covered their head with dust and wept, crying out loud. Some ladies were seen disheveling their hair, others pulling it out
Some raised their arms and lamented loudly
Some ran headlong, like gazelles pierced by poisonous arrows, all the while crying
“These are the silken garments of the prince. Can it be that he has been killed for their sake? Get hold of this man!
Some let their hair and nails and beards grow long, while others keep their hair braided in a topknot
There are also some who subsist on just a single juniper berry, sesame seed, or grain of rice
They drink hot water, water leftover after washing rice, water filtered through a blanket, and dishwater
Monks, this was the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva projected light from his body in the quiet of the night
Monks, while the Bodhisattva was dwelling in the womb of his mother, Queen Māyā did not feel any heaviness in her body
Some inhale smoke and fire, stare at the sun, and perform the five-fires ritual
She was not afflicted by attachment, anger, or delusion
She did not entertain any desirous thoughts, nor any thoughts of ill will or harm
They pay homage to houses, pillars, and rocks; clubs, swords, bows, axes, arrows, spears, and tridents
There was no female deception, guile, envy, or feminine disturbing emotions to trouble her
At that time the mother of the Bodhisattva observed the five basic precepts
“This is what these extremists rely on because of their fear of cyclic existence
She was disciplined and followed the path of the ten virtuous actions
The mother of the Bodhisattva never desired any man whomsoever, and neither did any man feel lust in the presence of the mother of the Bodhisattva
In doing so, some of them think, ‘Because of these methods, in the afterlife we shall find heaven and final emancipation.
In this way they go astray on errant paths. They seek refuge in that which cannot offer protection
They take as auspicious that which is not auspicious
Merely by seeing the mother of the Bodhisattva, any woman, man, boy, or girl in the city of Kapilavastu and its surrounding areas who had been possessed was cured and regained consciousness immediately, regardless of whether they had been possessed by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, or bhūtas
Those nonhuman beings quickly departed for other places
I will then demonstrate to these people, who disregard karmic actions, the inescapability of the fruits of actions
The reason for calling this difficult practice is because it is excruciatingly difficult, and therefore it is described in such terms
Monks, following up on these thoughts, the Bodhisattva now began a six-year period of extremely fierce prescribed practices and hardships that were intensely difficult, the hardest of all difficult practices
Queen Māyā would also pick herbs and distribute them to the sick, who would immediately regain their health and vigor
Seeing him in that way, she was satisfied, elated, and delighted. She felt extremely happy, buoyant, and joyful
The gods sent timely rains
and the winds blew at appropriate moments
The seasons and the stars all moved in a balanced manner
Monks, for eight winter nights I punished and tormented my body
In the city of Kapilavastu, the clan of the Śākyas and everyone else had plenty to eat and drink, and they enjoyed themselves with various amusements
They were generous and created merit
They happily amused themselves just as one does during the autumn festival at the end of the fourth month
King Śuddhodana devoted himself purely to religious practice
Sweat ran from my armpits and from my forehead. As the sweat fell on the ground, the drops turned into hoarfrost, heated up, and evaporated
Setting aside all his kingly work, he lived in complete purity as if he had entered an ascetic’s grove. With great delight, he followed the Dharma
Monks, such were the miraculous marvels that occurred while the Bodhisattva remained in his mother’s womb
At this time the Blessed One asked venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, would you like to see the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva when he stayed in his mother’s womb?
It was just like a strong man who grabs a very feeble person by the neck and strangles him
Monks, at that point I thought to myself
“I should now practice the all-pervading absorption.
Ānanda replied, “Yes, Blessed One. I would love to, Bliss-Gone One!
Then once again, Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, lifted up the jeweled structure and brought it with him to the Brahma realm, where he installed it as an object of worship
Then the Blessed One again addressed the monks
“Monks, in this way, while the Bodhisattva dwelt in his mother’s womb, he ripened  million gods and humans within the Three Vehicles.
On this topic, it is said
When the Victors’ Son, the Great Being, settled in his mother’s womb
The earth with its forests shook in six ways
Golden light shone forth and all the lower realms were purified
All the gods joyfully proclaimed, “He will be a Dharma king!
Well shaped and resplendent with many jewels is the great mansion Where the Hero, the Perfect Guide, has ascended and remains
It is resplendent, filled with exquisitely fragrant sandalwood
Monks, I then continued to think, “I should practice the all-pervading absorption.
A few grams of which is worth the whole trichiliocosm filled with jewels
Bursting forth from beneath the great trichiliocosm
Since my mouth, nose, and ears were blocked
A lotus, which is a mine of good qualities, emerged with a drop of vital energy
the breath went up into my skull
Within seven days, it reached the world of Brahmā through the power of merit
Some gods noticed the suffering of the Bodhisattva and remarked
Brahmā collected the vital drop and offered it to the Victors’ Son
Apart from the Bodhisattva, a mighty hero, No being anywhere could digest the drop
And, monks, as I was practicing the all-pervading absorption, from my mouth and my nose all movement of breath ceased, and within the openings of my ears an immense sound was heard
“Oh no! It seems the young Siddhārtha is dying!
The others remarked, “No, he’s not dying. This is simply how worthy ones abide in absorption.
On this occasion, they then sang these verses
These gods then went to the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and told Māyādevī, “It seems that the young prince is about to pass away.
This drop of vital energy is imbued with the merit of many eons
Whoever consumes it becomes pure in body, mind, and consciousness
Śakra, Brahmā, and the guardians of the world paid the Bodhisattva three visits In order to make offerings to the Guide
They prostrated, made offerings, and listened to the sublime Dharma
Then they circled around him and returned to their abodes
She saw how thin the Bodhisattva had become, and it appeared as if he had died
Upon seeing this, she was choked with tears and began to weep
She then sang these verses
From all worlds and realms came bodhisattvas desiring the Dharma
“When I gave birth to you, my son, in the Lumbinī Grove, Without support, like a lion, you took seven steps on your own
Sitting on seats of light, they illumined each other
You gazed in the four directions and said these beautiful words: ‘This is my last birth.
Those words will now never come to pass
“Asita predicted that you would be a buddha in this world, But his prediction was wrong, as he did not foresee impermanence
“To whom can I turn to about my son? To whom shall I cry out in my pain? Who will give life back to my only son, Who is barely alive?
The Bodhisattva answered
“Who are you? You cry so heart wrenchingly, With disheveled hair and your beauty impaired, Lamenting your son so intensely And throwing yourself on the ground.
“Oh no! You are the essential being and your commitment is strong
Protector, previously in the Heaven of Joy you invited us To hear the gift of the sacred Dharma, But now where is your resolve, O Pure Being?
“As for grieving for your son, there is no need to worry; your hardship will pay off
Because they heard the sacred Dharma of the Supreme Vehicle
They all could leave with joy, proclaiming songs of praise
Any woman or child afflicted by suffering
The sun, the moon, and the stars may fall to the ground
“It is possible that the world may break into a hundred pieces, and the jewel peak of Mount Meru may fall into the ocean
Likewise the prediction of Dīpaṃkara shall come to pass
Yet although I am an ordinary person, I will not die
Therefore do not bring misery on yourself
Before long you shall behold the awakening of a buddha.
Then, accompanied by heavenly music, she went back to her abode
Monks, at that point I thought to myself
“Because some religious practitioners and priests believe that one becomes purified by eating very little food, I must also be diligent in fasting.
Monks, you might think that the juniper berries of that time were larger than now, but that is not the case. They were just as they are now
I should also apply myself to completely abstaining from any food.
Monks, I then began a complete fast
During this time King Śuddhodana sent a messenger every day to see the Bodhisattva
The Bodhisattva remained sitting cross-legged for six years
With intelligence and mindfulness restored, they returned to their homes
Possessed by spirits, with troubled mind, naked and covered with dust, Recovered their senses upon seeing Queen Māyā
Those afflicted by illness caused by disorders of wind, bile, or phlegm
And those with body and mind tormented by diseases of the eyes and ears
And all those stricken by many different kinds of ailments
Were freed from illness when Queen Māyā placed her hand on their heads
Moreover, gathering herbs from the ground
He simply sat the way he was, without forsaking his activity
When the sun was shining, he did not seek shade
Māyā gave them to the sick, who all became cured
Never did he seek shelter from the wind, the sun, and the rain
Happy and healthy, they returned to their homes
He never chased away mosquitoes, bees, and poisonous snakes
While the King of Physicians, the remedy itself, dwelt in the womb
Whenever Queen Māyā examined her body
He did not defecate, urinate, spit, or blow his nose
Neither did he bend his limbs or stretch them out
In fact the Bodhisattva did not even use his hand to shelter himself
He did not block his senses, but neither did he follow after the objects of his senses
The Bodhisattva was ornamented by marks
When people placed grass or cotton in his ears, it would stick out of his nostrils
When they did the same with his nostrils, the grass and cotton would emerge from his ears
When they placed things in his ears, they would stick out of his mouth
And when they stuffed things in his mouth, they would come out of his ears and nose
She was untroubled by attachment, anger, or delusion
Had no sexual desires, nor envy or ill will
Things put in his nostrils would appear out of his ears, nose, and mouth
While the Bodhisattva demonstrated austerities for six years, one thousand two hundred billion gods and humans were matured in the Three Vehicles
On this topic, it is said
The Bodhisattva left his home In possession of all good qualities
In order to benefit sentient beings, He gave rise to a skillful outlook
Making their own bodies into tools, These childish people think they are purified
“They walk into ravines, fire, and desolate areas; Naked, they smear themselves in soil and ashes
In order to punish the body, They employ the five-fires ritual
“They commit the error of using mantras; In ignorance they lick their hands
Some do not take food from vases; Others reject offerings near doors and pillars
With a joyful and elated mind, she was blissful
“Some won’t take offerings where a dog lives; Others reject places where they are told to stay or come
Never bothered by hunger and thirst, or heat and cold
By receiving a single offering from a house, They think, ‘I have become pure.
“Some reject butter, oil, molasses, and yogurt; Others won’t eat fish, meat, and milk
The sounds of divine instruments constantly arose without being played
Instead they eat vegetables and grain, Lotus roots and garḍula seeds
“Some hold up their hand outstretched; Others keep their hair in a braided knot
Excellent sublime flowers, fragrant with divine perfumes, fell like rain
Straying from the path, They have lost the path, yet they hope for happy rebirths
“They sleep on beds of grass, sticks, and ashes; They sleep on thorns or sit upright
Gods and humans beheld this, and none of them Felt any resentment or ill will toward one another
Beings rejoiced and played, and made offerings of food and drink
They uttered cries of joy, content and delighted as they were
The kingdom was at peace, undisturbed and with well-timed rain
Grasses, medicinal herbs, and flowers grew in a timely manner
Some always stand on one leg, Staring, with their faces upturned, at the sun and the moon
Over the royal palace, a rain of jewels fell for seven days
Impoverished beings brought them home and enjoyed the bounty
At that time there were no impoverished or suffering beings
Everyone was as joyful as the beings in the pleasure grove atop Mount Meru
“They also venerate springs, lakes, and ponds, The ocean, rivers, the sun, and the moon, Trees and mountain peaks, Rocks and soil
“These fools use many different methods, Trying to purify their bodies
He went into the grove of the ascetics and said to Māyādevī
Because of their wrong views, They will quickly fall into the lower realms
“How blissful your body must be, bearing the Perfect Being!
At that time thirty-two omens occurred in King Śuddhodana’s parks
All flowers budded and blossomed
In the ponds, all the blue, red, and white lotus flowers also budded and blossomed
New fruit and flower trees sprung from the earth, budded, and came into blossom
Eight trees of precious gems appeared
“The intense hardship That I now intend to engage in Will consist of austerities, discipline, and adversities That no god or human can perform
“My concentration will be one That even solitary buddhas cannot demonstrate
Twenty thousand great treasures emerged and remained on the grounds
Stable and firm like a diamond, I will now practice the all-pervasive concentration
“There are gods and humans Who delight in the distorted discipline of extremists
Inside the women’s quarters, jeweled shoots sprouted forth. Scented water, saturated with fragrant oils, flowed forth
In order to ripen these beings, I will now practice fierce hardship and discipline.
Lion cubs descended from the snow mountains
For six years he practiced the supreme concentration— The all-pervasive concentration
Without any conceptual thought, Immutable and mentally still, He practiced the all-pervasive concentration That merges with the element of space
He neither moved from the sun to the shade, Nor from the shade to the sun
Immutable like the central mountain, He practiced the all-pervasive concentration
They joyfully circled the sublime city of Kapilavastu and then rested by the gates without harming anyone
Five hundred young white elephants arrived
stroking King Śuddhodana’s feet with the tips of their trunks, and then settling down next to him
Divine children, wearing sashes,  were seen moving back and forth between the laps of the women in the retinue of King Śuddhodana’s queen
Nāga girls could be seen holding aloft various offerings, revealing the upper half of their bodies as they moved about in the sky
He did not protect himself against the wind and the rain, Nor mosquitoes, poisonous snakes, or bees
With a completely undisturbed behavior, He practiced the all-pervasive concentration
Not merely for his own sake Did he practice the all-pervasive concentration
Ten thousand celestial maidens were seen hovering in the sky, holding up peacock feathers
With compassion for others, He practiced for their sake as well
Ten thousand full vases appeared in a ring around the city of Kapilavastu
Ten thousand celestial maidens appeared with vases of scented water on their heads
Ten thousand celestial maidens appeared holding up parasols, flags, and banners
Many hundreds of thousands of celestial maidens appeared holding conch shells, drums, clay drums, and cymbals adorned with bells
The winds became still and ceased to blow
Yet village children and cow herders And those who gather wood and grass Thought that he was a demon made of dust And covered him in soil
All streams and rivers stopped their flow
They even covered him with impure substances And harmed him in many ways
The sun, the moon, the celestial chariots, the planets, and the stars all stood still
Yet immovable and calm, He practiced the all-pervasive concentration
The constellation of Puṣya appeared
King Śuddhodana’s residence became adorned with a net of jewels
All fires were extinguished
Neither getting up nor lying down, He did nothing to protect his body
He did not defecate nor did he urinate
When sounds were heard, he was neither startled, nor did he avert his gaze
His flesh and blood dried out So that the bones and tendons stuck out through his skin
His spine could be seen through his belly, Twisted like braided hair
The gods, demigods, yakṣas, gandharvas, and nāgas Who supported him, Made offerings to him day and night Because of seeing his qualities
“May we also quickly be like him!” Such aspirations did they make
The palace, temples, gateways, and doorways were decorated with tassels of jewels and gems
When the shade fell on him, he did not move into the sun
The doors to the storehouses of cloths and gems appeared wide open
Since his mind is like the sky, He practiced the all-pervasive concentration
The calls of crows, owls, vultures, wolves, and jackals ceased to be heard
Instead many delightful sounds were heard
Motivated by compassion for others, He sought to bring about vast benefits to the world
He did not practice for himself, Neither for pleasure nor to feel the taste of absorption
He overcame his opponents’ attacks
He outshone the feeble minds of extremists
All people stopped their work
Māra approached him and said, With soft and pleasant words
The ground became level without any bumps or hollows
To attain accomplishment and bliss, He remained calm and diligent
All crossroads, junctions, roads, and marketplaces became as even and smooth as the palm of a hand and were beautifully bestrewn with flower petals
There, for the sake of renunciation, The Bodhisattva persevered with continuous and stable strength
All pregnant women birthed their babies with comfort and ease
All the gods in the sāl forest revealed half their bodies from among the trees’ leaves and remained there, bowing
Such were the thirty-two omens that occurred
Then Māyādevī, due to the magnificence and strength of the Bodhisattva, knew that it was time for her to give birth
And it appears as though you’re on the verge of dying
Death has a thousand chances, While life has only one
“The path of renunciation brings only suffering And taming the mind is hard.
Why then do you practice renunciation
“One who always gives And performs fire offerings Will accumulate great merit
This is what Māra said When addressing the Bodhisattva
During the first watch of the night, she came to King Śuddhodana and spoke these words
“Lord, please listen to what is on my mind
For a long time now, I have thought about the pleasure grove
“For you have no intent That would match my merits, Māra. If you were interested in merit, You would rather speak like this
“ ‘Since the end of life is death, I do not concern myself with death
Wholly devoted to my religious practice, I shall never back down
If you will not be upset, displeased, or envious, I should quickly go to that pleasure grove
“You are also weary from austerities and diligently contemplating the Dharma
I myself have carried a pure being within me for a long time now
The sāl, that most wonderful of trees, is now in blossom
O Lord, it is therefore fitting for us to go to the pleasure grove
“Spring, that excellent season, is a joyous time for women
The bees are humming and the cuckoos singing
Fresh and sweet, the fragrance of flowers drifts through the air— Please issue an order, and let us go there right away!
The king heard Māyādevī’s words, and then, Delighted and elated, he spoke to his retinue
“Arrange my horses, elephants, and chariots
Decorate the excellent garden at Lumbinī
“Quick, prepare twenty thousand elephants, Dark blue like mountains or storm clouds
Ornament the lordly six-tusked elephants with bells attached to their flanks
Decorate them with gold and gems and cover them with lattices of gold
“ ‘If even the flow of rivers Can be dried out by the wind, Then what about the body and blood of the renunciant
Wouldn’t that be dried out as well
“ ‘When his blood has dried out, his flesh will wither
When his flesh has wasted away, His mind will become yet clearer
He will have more dedication, diligence, and absorption.
“Since I live like that, I have attained the highest perception, So I do not worry about my body and my life
Just look at the purity of my being
“Quick, harness twenty thousand royal steeds, Fast as the wind, strong and excellent steeds, With silvery snow-colored tails, manes that are beautifully plaited
And lattices of golden bells hung on their flanks
“I am dedicated and diligent; I have insight as well
In this world I see no one Capable of disturbing my diligence
“Better is death, the thief of the life force, Than living an unwholesome life
It is better to die in battle Than live defeated by the enemy
“A coward cannot defeat an army; Armies conquer and win respect
“Desire is your foremost army; Discontent comes next
Third is hunger and thirst; Craving is your fourth army
“This army of yours, Which overcomes this world and that of the gods
I will destroy it with knowledge, Just as water destroys a vessel of unbaked clay
As the Bodhisattva spoke these words, Māra, the evil one, felt very uncomfortable and sad
Having lost his confidence, he disappeared
“Have Lumbinī bestrewn with gold and jewels; Adorn all the trees with many types of cloths and jewels. Quick, plant many flowers, like in the gardens of the gods
Arrange all of this, and then swiftly report to me.
Hearing this, the retinue immediately arranged All the conveyances and ornamented Lumbinī
They then called out, “Victory! Victory! Long live the king
Your command is fulfilled and all is ready. Please look, O lord!
The sublime lord of men, with a joyous mind
Entered the palace and spoke thus to the women
“Those of you to whom I am dear and who would like to bring me joy
Follow my command and adorn yourselves
Monks, I continued to think
But there must be another path to awakening that can eradicate the future suffering of birth, old age, and death.
“With colorful clothes, beautiful and soft, And fragrant with enchanting perfume
Adorn your chests with necklaces of pearls
Today everyone should wear all their ornaments
“Bring hundreds of thousands of delightful instruments: Hand drums, flutes, lutes, clay drums, and cymbals
Hearing the melodious sound of these instruments, even the gods will be pleased
You make the goddesses similarly joyful
“In the supreme chariot, only Māyādevī shall sit
None of the ladies nor the men shall join her
This chariot shall be led by a host of bright young women
No one shall mention anything unpleasant or unfitting!
Māyādevī then left her palace and went to the door of the king. When she arrived, the divisions of horses, elephants, chariots, and foot soldiers All called out with a deafening roar, As loud as the waves on a great turbulent ocean
At this moment, auspiciously, a hundred thousand bells rang out
As he searched for the Dharma, he was insatiable
He taught the Dharma just as he had heard it
He was a master of generosity in bestowing the gift of the unexcelled great Dharma
The four precious trees were complete with flowers and leaves
Peacocks, cranes, and swans sounded their delightful calls
Parasols, flags, and banners of all sizes were hoisted
He actualized the Buddha and the Dharma and perfected the power of aspiration
For sentient beings he felt great compassion and kept their complete freedom foremost in his mind
The chariot was covered with a beautiful lattice of tinkling bells and divine cloth
From up in the heavens, celestial maidens looked down at the chariot
They called out in divine melodious tones, offering words of praise
When Māyādevī sat upon the lion throne
The earth of the trichiliocosm trembled in six ways
knowledge of demigods
knowledge of game animals, knowledge of bird sounds
logic
The gods waved cloths and scattered a rain of flowers
“Today at Lumbinī, a sublime being is to be born!
astrology
The Blessed One was staying in Śrāvastī at Jeta Grove, in the park of Anāthapiṇḍada
Along with these monks were , bodhisattvas, all of whom had only a single birth remaining and were adept in all the perfections of the bodhisattvas
Brahmā, going ahead, expelled all untamed creatures
Hundreds of thousands of gods joined their hands and bowed down
This concludes the twenty-seventh chapter, the epilogue
The king, with a joyful heart, surveyed what had been prepared
This completes the Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra, The Play in Full
Thinking, “This child must be the god of gods
When the four guardians, Brahmā, and the gods, led by Śakra
make such offerings, He will surely become a buddha
This was taught and translated by the Indian scholars Jinamitra, Dānaśīla, and Munivarma, and the translator-editor Yeshe De, who proofed and finalized the translation
For their heads would burst asunder or their lives be lost
Yet he, supreme among gods, can accept all offerings.
“Friends, in short, even if the lifespan of the Thus-Gone One were to last for an eon
and even if he were to praise this Dharma teaching uninterruptedly day and night
he would not be able to end his praise of this Dharma teaching
and his inspired speech would still continue
Monks, Māyādevī now set forth, surrounded and protected by , richly ornamented horse-drawn chariots
, richly ornamented elephant-drawn chariots
and , brave, heroic, and handsome foot soldiers wearing excellent and solid armor
She was escorted by , Śākya maidens
She was guarded by , elders, youths, and middle-aged men from King Śuddhodana’s Śākya clan
She was also surrounded by , women from King Śuddhodana’s retinue, who sang songs and played music, bells, and cymbals
‘Come here! Write this teaching down! Hold it! Pass it on! Reflect on it! Memorize it well!’ they shall attain eight great treasures
Every tree in that perfect grove had leaves, flowers, and fruits, even though it was out of season
Even the gods had done their best to decorate the forest
They had, in fact, made it appear like the gods’ Miśraka Garden
By satisfying bodies and minds, one’s voice will be like the voice of the cuckoo bird
When Māyādevī arrived at the Lumbinī Grove, she stepped down from her fine chariot
By uniting beings, one will have one’s say. By outshining all voices, one will have a voice like Brahmā
As human and divine maidens encircled her
she wandered from tree to tree and from grove to grove
She looked among all the trees and eventually arrived beneath a very special and exquisite fig tree
Its branches spread out
she took it with her in order to make memorials for veneration
full of lush leaves and clusters of blossoms
When the Bodhisattva emerged from the river, he wanted to sit down, and so he looked for a suitable place on the riverbank
and further adorned with numerous flowers from the realms of both humans and gods
Richly scented cloths of many colors were draped across its branches
Right then, a nāga girl who lived in the Nairañjanā River emerged out of the earth’s surface and offered the Bodhisattva a throne made of jewels
The Bodhisattva took his seat there and, while he was thinking fondly of the village girl Sujātā, he drank what he needed of the milk porridge made with honey
It was sparkling with the light of many gems and jewels
Its roots, trunk, branches, and leaves were all adorned with jewels
“I have found this dusty rag
so it would be good if I could find some water to wash it with.
At that very moment the gods hit the ground with their hands
and on that spot a lotus pond appeared
Still to this day, this pond is known as “The Pond Where the Hands Struck.
Its branches were long and spread out spaciously. The ground where the fig tree stood was smooth like the palm of a hand, beautiful and open, and it was full of dark blue grass, the color of a peacock’s neck
The earth was pleasant to the touch, like soft kācilindika cloth
This tree had supported the mothers of previous victorious ones
and it had been praised in the poetry of the gods
It was a tree to which the wholesome and peaceful gods of the pure realms would bow down and touch with their heads, including their topknots and diadems
The goddess lowered a branch and, as the Bodhisattva grasped it, he was lifted out of the pond
Once he was free, he remained under the shade of the kakubha tree, where he sewed the dusty rag into the robes of a monk
However, at this moment the Bodhisattva’s magnificence and power caused the fig tree itself to bow down and pay homage to him
Once again the Bodhisattva thought
In order to follow the worldly custom and to please the goddess of that tree, the Bodhisattva called out to her
Māyādevī stretched out her right arm, like a flash of lightning appearing in the middle of the sky, and grasped a branch of the tree
At that point a god from the pure realms, who was called Vimalaprabha
She auspiciously directed her gaze into the open sky and stretched her body
At both sides of the road, they had magically erected a railing made from the seven types of precious stones
At that point sixty thousand goddesses from the desire realm approached Māyādevī to assist and venerate her
The road was shaded, at the height of seven palm trees, with a jeweled latticework and adorned with divine parasols, flags, and banners
At a distance of an arrow’s flight, they had emanated a row of palm trees made of the seven types of precious stones and taller than the railing
Between all the palm trees, jewel garlands were strung
Such were the miracles that occurred while the Bodhisattva was in his mother’s womb
Now, as the ten months had been completed, he emerged from his mother’s right side, fully aware and mindful
In between each pair of palm trees, a lotus pon
Unborn and without origination, Unique and empty of inherent nature
was built, filled with scented water, lined with golden sand, and covered in blue, yellow, red, and white lotuses
In this way he was unstained by any impurities of the womb, which otherwise are said to stain everyone else
Eighty thousand divine maidens sprinkled the path with flowers of divine scent
Monks, at that time Śakra, lord of the gods, and Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, appeared before the Bodhisattva
On each of these jewel podiums were also five thousand divine maidens singing celestial songs
“Maitreya, this turning of the wheel of Dharma is merely a brief teaching that praises just a few of the qualities of the Thus-Gone One
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva proceeded on his way
Maitreya, to list them in an elaborate manner, the Thus-Gone One would need an eon or more. And still that would not be enough to list them all.
At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses
Which is profound, hard to behold, and subtle
“The wheel of Dharma has been turned
It is not understood by the extremists, Nor by the demons
He is a venerable teacher of the Dharma who never mistakes any words or syllables
He teaches the Dharma in a timely manner
He is the one who teaches the Dharma free from worldliness
Adorned with hundreds of thousands of auspicious signs, such was the road on which the Bodhisattva traveled on his way to the seat of awakening
emitting trillions of light rays, while the realms shook, music played from millions of instruments, a great rain with an abundance of flowers fell
millions of silken banners fluttered in the wind
millions of drums resounded as they were beaten
In front of each of the palm trees was a jewel podium on which eighty thousand divine maidens stood, proffering containers with powders of sandal and aloeswood, and holding up lighted incense burners with sandalwood
“Friends,” he said, “you should be aware of this
The Bodhisattva, the Great Being, has donned the great armor
Without forsaking his great vow, protected by his solid armor
The Bodhisattva stood on a large lotus and surveyed the four directions with his lion’s gaze, the gaze of a great being
he is undeterred and has perfected all the conduct of a bodhisattva
A parasol of precious gems and two yak-tail whisks also appeared from midair
“He is the one whose voice resounds like the voice of Brahmā
He is the one with the voice of a cuckoo bird
He has reached the further shore of all the perfections and become a master of all the grounds of a bodhisattva
He is perfectly pure in his aspirations of a bodhisattva and joins in the five spiritual faculties of all sentient beings
He has entered the secret locations of all the thus-gone ones and is beyond all paths of demonic activity
He is not dependent on others regarding the basis for acquiring merit
He is blessed by all thus-gone ones
He demonstrates the path to complete freedom for all sentient beings
He is a great captain who conquers the circle of Māra’s army
He is the single hero of the trichiliocosm
Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, and many hundreds of thousands of gods then bathed the Bodhisattva in perfumed water and scattered flower petals over him
“He has accomplished all the medicines of Dharma and is the great king of physicians, wearing a silken headband of salvation
He is the great Dharma king who shines the bright light of knowledge
He is a great meteor-like king who, like a magnificent lotus flower, is unstained by the eight worldly concerns
He never forgets the dhāraṇīs of any teaching
Wherever his feet touched the ground, a large lotus immediately sprung from the earth
He is like a great ocean, free from attachment and aversion
As soon as he was born, the Bodhisattva stepped onto the ground
He is immovable and unshakable like the great central mountain
As they remembered and recognized who he was, they were full of veneration for the Bodhisattva and wrapped him up in divine silk
The temple in which the Bodhisattva had dwelt while in his mother’s womb was carried off by Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, and the other gods of the Brahma realm up into their realm, where they enshrined the temple in a memorial and made it an object of worship
Thus the Bodhisattva was first received by the gods rather than by any humans
and thus he is like a great jewel
However, in the entire great trichiliocosm, the Bodhisattva did not see anyone like himself
At that point the Bodhisattva felt a lion-like fearlessness
He proceeds in order to perfectly accomplish the ten powers, the fourfold fearlessness, and the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha
His aim is to turn the great wheel of Dharma and utter the lion’s great roar
With the gift of Dharma, he will satisfy all sentient beings
He will purify the eye of Dharma of all sentient beings and annihilate all his opponents together with their doctrines
He goes to the seat of awakening to demonstrate the fulfillment of his previous vows and to gain a ruler’s complete mastery over all phenomena
free of anxiety or apprehension. Without any hesitation or wavering, he reminded himself of his good motivations. Because he had examined the minds of all sentient beings, he now knew their thoughts
Unsupported, he took seven steps toward the east and declared, “I will be the cause of all virtuous practices.
Friends, for these reasons you should pay homage to the Bodhisattva and joyfully assist him in every way possible!
Then at that point the all-powerful Brahmā spoke these verses
Wherever the Bodhisattva took a step, a lotus sprouted forth
He then took seven steps toward the south and said, “I am worthy of the offerings of gods and humans.
He then took seven steps toward the north and said, “I will be supreme among all sentient beings!
Has practiced wholesome conduct for a thousand eons and now sets out for the Bodhi tree
“He, by whose merits and glorious splendor the great path can be known— Love, compassion, joy, and equanimity, as well as the absorptions and the types of higher knowledg
You should make offerings to that sage as he practices to fulfill his aspirations
“I will subjugate Māra and his army
“Take refuge in him, and you will not meet or experience the fears of the lower realms or the lack of the freedoms
Instead you will find the happiness of desire-realm gods in the vast abode of Brahmā
He went through hardship for six years, and now he departs for the Bodhi tree
Well done! Let us all venerate this man with joy and devotion
“He is the king of the trichiliocosm, the best of masters, the royal master of Dharma
In the cities of Indra, Brahmā, the Sun, and the Moon, there is no equal to him
When he was born, one trillion worlds quaked in six different ways
Today he sets out for the supreme magnificent tree to conquer the armies of Māra
Finally he took seven steps uphill, lifted his gaze, and said, “All sentient beings will look up to me.
“The crown of his head I cannot see, nor can the others here in the Brahmā realm
His body, bearing the best of the excellent marks, is adorned with the thirty-two
As the Bodhisattva spoke in this way, his words were immediately heard throughout the entire great trichiliocosm
His speech is beautiful, sweet, and pleasant to hear, a voice melodious like that of Brahmā
His mind is calm and free from anger. Come, let’s pay him homage
Such was the nature of the foreknowledge that sprang from the ripening of the Bodhisattva’s previous actions
Whenever a bodhisattva takes birth into his final existence, and as he awakens to perfect and complete buddhahood, various miracles unfold
Monks, at that time all beings were so delighted that the hairs on their bodies shivered
There was also a terrifying quaking of the earth, which caused the hairs on their bodies to stand on end
“Intelligent ones who aim to transcend the perpetual bliss in the realms of Indra and Brahmā
The cymbals and musical instruments of gods and humans sounded without being played by anyone
Or those who wish to cut the net of the fettering vines of disturbing emotions
At that time all the trees in the great trichiliocosm—whether in season or not—blossomed and bore fruit
Deliciously scented breezes blew, delightful and coolin
In all directions there was no darkness, dust, smoke, or mist to be seen, and everything appeared bright and beautiful
Also, from the empty space above, the great melodious and profound sounds of the realm of Brahmā were heard
He covered this entire world of the great trichiliocosm in soft green grass, curled to the right in the pattern of a swastika, soft as the finest cloth, and pleasant to the touch
There was no longer any gravel or rocks, and instead the world was filled with jewels, pearls, cat’s-eye gems, conch shells, crystals, corals, gold, and silver
At that moment, all the great oceans had also become as peaceful as dry land, and all the beings who live in the waters had become free from any harm
All other bodhisattvas who are beyond the world of humans and gods also wished to venerate the Bodhisattva, and therefore they adorned the limitless buddha realms in the ten directions with an array of offerings
All these buddha realms, even though they were adorned in different ways, now appeared as one single buddha realm
Or those wishing to attain immortality without hearing about it from others, which is an auspicious solitary awakenin
If anyone desires awakening, they should pay homage, in the three realms, to this guide‌
“He has renounced the earth with its oceans, along with countless precious objects
All the space between the worlds had disappeared, as had the encircling black mountains and the smaller and greater perimeter walls
All these buddha realms could be seen permeated with the light streaming from the Bodhisattva
At the seat of awakening, there were sixteen gods who guarded the place
Their names were Utkhalin, Sūtkhalin, Prajāpati, Śūrabhala, Keyūrabala, Supratiṣṭhita, Mahindhara, Avabhāsakara, Vimala, Dharmeśvara, Dharmaketu, Siddhapātra, Apratihata­netra, Mahāvyūha, Śila­viśuddha­netra, and Padmaprabha
which filled the entire great trichiliocosm and brought pleasure and happiness, both physical and mental, to everyone that it touched
At the very moment when the Bodhisattva was born, all beings became filled with bliss
All types of attachment, anger, delusion, pride
It was these sixteen gods, all of whom had attained irreversible patience, who guarded the seat of awakening
In this way, the gods who guarded the seat of awakening magically manifested such displays at that place
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, they had adorned the seat of awakening
At a distance of eighty leagues, they had encircled the place with railings, built in seven rows
The illnesses of the sick were cured
The hungry and the thirsty were relieved of their hunger and thirst
Palm trees were also placed in seven circles, and a sevenfold lattice with bells of precious stones enfolded it
The drunk and intoxicated were freed from their intoxication
All of this was surrounded with seven threads made of precious materials
The mad had their sanity restored
The blind could see
The deaf could hear
The seat of awakening was covered with cloth made of gold from the Jambū River, a cloth studded with seven precious gems and woven with a golden thread
It was bestrewn with lotuses of gold from the Jambū River, scented with aromatic essences, and covered by a jewel canopy
All the beautiful and excellent trees that grow and are venerated in all the different worlds in the ten directions, including the worlds of gods and humans, now manifested at the seat of awakening
Likewise all the different species of flowers that grow in water as well as on land manifested there at the seat of awakening
Moreover, the bodhisattvas in all the various worlds in the ten directions now became visible at the seat of awakening, adorning the place with their immeasurable accumulations of merit and wisdom
As they saw the displays, they felt great respect and exclaimed with joy
“How great! What an inconceivable manifestation of meritorious ripening this is!
At the Bodhi tree itself there were four deities: Veṇu, Valgu, Sumanas, and Ojopati
The crippled had their capacities restored
The destitute gained wealth
The imprisoned were freed
All ailments and sufferings of those in the hell realms, starting with the Hell of Ultimate Torment, ceased at that moment
The suffering of those born into the animal realm, such as the fear of being eaten by one another, was also pacified
The newborn Bodhisattva had already practiced good conduct for countless trillions of eons, and he possessed great diligence and strength
As such, when he took his first seven steps, he had already attained the state of reality
Therefore all the buddhas, the blessed ones, in all the realms in the ten directions blessed the earth at that spot of vajra nature so that it would not be destroyed by his steps
Monks, such was the awesome strength of the newborn Bodhisattva’s first seven steps
At that time the entire world was filled with a bright light, and the sounds of singing and dancing were heard
showered down from innumerable clouds
All beings were filled with perfect joy
The light pacified all the lower realms and caused all unfortunate states to cease
All the painful feelings of beings in the lower realms came to a halt
Monks, as the Bodhisattva was walking toward the seat of awakening, rays of light streamed forth from his body
Venerable Ānanda now stood up from his seat
removed his robe from one shoulder, and kneeled, placing his right knee on the ground
He joined his palms in the direction of the Blessed One, bowed, and addressed these words to him
“The Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, is truly more amazing than anyone else
All beings with impaired faculties now recovered their senses
The Bodhisattva possessed incredible qualities, but how much more so the One Who Has Awakened to Perfect and Complete Buddhahood
Anyone who suffered from disease was healed
Anyone feeling discomfort attained happiness
All who were struck with fear found release
Anyone living in bondage was freed from his or her ties
Anyone suffering from poverty discovered wealth
O Blessed One, I therefore take refuge in Lord Buddha four times, five times, ten times, fifty times, a hundred times, or rather many hundreds of thousands of times!
Like unskilled children
they will be highly proud
This place, where the Bodhisattva was to take his seat with the intention of attaining full and complete awakening, had become the essence of indestructible diamond, harder than any diamond in the great trichiliocosm
All of this was surrounded with seven threads made of precious materials that formed the outer ring
Like the coral tree or the kovidāra tree, this was a tree that one could never tire of beholding
Jewel palm trees were also placed around it in seven circles
and a sevenfold lattice with bells of precious stones enfolded it
It was encircled by jewel platforms that were built in seven rows
‘Listen, all of you, just listen to this nonsense
and a corresponding circumference, very imposing. This was indeed a magnificent and beautiful tree
The Bodhisattva supposedly entered into his mother’s womb, where he mixed with impure fluids. And yet he is said to have had such enjoyments
Those who were starving had their stomachs filled
All the people tormented by disturbing emotions found release from their anguish
All the ones who were parched were relieved of their thirst
Pregnant women gave birth easily
Those who were old and weak gained perfect strength
At that moment all sentient beings were relieved of the harms inflicted by attachment, anger, ignorance, wrath, greed, cruelty, ill will, envy, and jealousy
At that moment no one experienced dying, moving to the next life, and taking birth
Moreover, it is said that when he was born, he emerged from his mother’s right side without being sullied by any stains of the womb. But how could this be possible?
At that moment everyone engendered love, altruism, and a feeling that all beings are each other’s mothers and fathers
“Such fools will not understand that the bodies of those who have engaged in excellent actions are not begotten from unclean fluids
All the way to the hell of Ultimate Torment, The hell beings presented a horrible sight
These beings had their suffering pacified And experienced feelings of happiness
The beings born as animals
Which harm each other in countless ways
Were touched by the light of the Lord, And, for their good, gave rise to a loving mind
Monks, such sublime beings enter into and abide in the womb in the finest manner
It is due to their love and compassion for sentient beings that bodhisattvas are born into the world of humans, since gods do not turn the wheel of Dharma
Why is this
Spirits, as many as there are in the world
Pained by hunger and thirst
Discovered food and drink Through the power of the Bodhisattva
All unfortunate states came to a halt
And the lower realms dried out
All beings gained happiness And were fulfilled with divine pleasure
Those without eyes and ears
“For so long he has recognized his own faults and never pointed out the faults of others who have stumbled
And all others with impaired faculties, Regained their full senses And obtained beautiful limbs
Attachment and anger And other disturbing emotions that harm beings— In that moment all these disturbing emotions were pacified, And beings were filled with happiness
“He is called the one who is like Vaiśravaṇa, the one who grants the treasury of the seven noble riches
The ones who had lost their minds regained their composure
Those living in poverty found wealth
Those stricken with sickness were healed
Those who were bound were freed
There was no miserliness nor animosity, No ill will or strife
All beings interacted in harmony, Their minds full of loving kindness
Just as a father and mother Cherish their only child, At that moment all beings felt Parental love for each other
The web of the Bodhisattva’s light rays Streamed out all around in the ten directions And illuminated an inconceivable number of realms, As numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges
The Black Mountains And the surrounding perimeter walls disappeared
The attendants at the seat of awakening Were a group of sixteen gods
Up to a distance of eighty leagues, They adorned the seat of awakening
“Lord, these bodhisattvas, the great beings, who reside in the ten directions of the world, would like to hear from you in person in order to learn how you turn the wheel of Dharma
“It will not occur to these foolish beings, such thieves of the Dharma, to think, ‘This being is inconceivable and we cannot judge him.
At that point the bodhisattva, the great being, Maitreya said to the Blessed One
Now may we swiftly become the best in this world; may we give to others the eye of Dharma.
Then they said, “Even we are able to follow in the footsteps of this Sage with all his glorious diligence and power
When the hundred million beings heard this answer from the buddhas
The Dharma wheel, which revolves three times, has been set in motion, so this is why we are silent.
Thus he, the Benefactor, attained spiritual heat and the most auspicious awakening
Even the wishes of others were fulfilled Through his actions in the past
The ripening of those actions Now produced such perfect results
“The Sage of the Śākyas, endowed with the ten powers, went to the Hill of the Fallen Sages at Vārāṇasī, where he turned the supreme wheel of Dharma
Its sweet and beautiful sound could be heard throughout the heavens
Why did you become silent? Please tell us right away!
“When we heard this voice, you stopped the Dharma talk that you were delivering by means of your ten powers
The buddhas replied, “In the past, for hundreds of lives this Buddha strove diligently toward awakening and did better than many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas
When gods and humans witnessed this display, They were filled with amazement
“How great is this manifestation of merit, Which results in such an auspicious juncture!
All great displays In all the limitless millions of realms Now manifested at this place By the power of the Bodhisattva
The gods, nāgas, yakṣas, Kiṃnaras, and mahoragas Now came to think of their celestial palaces As nothing more than charnel grounds
Without any effort, Whether physical, verbal, or mental
All the Bodhisattva’s goals, wishes, and intentions Were fully accomplished
The four deities at the seat of awakening Adorned the seat of awakening To make it even more supreme Than the heavenly coral trees
The displays at the seat of awakening Were created by these four deities. To describe their qualities in words Would be utterly impossible
“Holy Man, give the cloth to me. Then I will wash it.
Yet at the side of the pond was a large kakubha tree
“Whoever has no thought or concept has found the true way; Whoever has found the true way has no ignorance
Whoever has brought this ignorance to a halt Has exhausted all forms of existence for good
In this way these impertinent beings will abandon the Buddha’s teachings. Just consider how much nonvirtue they will accumulate!
Ānanda, these future people will also not believe in the Buddha’s miracles, let alone the miracles displayed by the Thus-Gone Bodhisattva
Ānanda, it is because beings would otherwise have been discouraged
thinking, ‘The Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the completely perfect Buddha is a god
Ānanda asked, “Blessed One! In the future will there really be such monks who reject excellent sūtras like this one, and who speak poorly of them?
“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One, “not only will there be those who reject the sūtras and speak poorly of them
“There is no place here for the heretics of other schools
Those beings who are fortunate enough to understand this teaching Are those who studied and were purified under previous buddhas.
When the wheel of Dharma was turned With its twelve aspects
Kauṇḍinya understood the meaning, And so the Three Jewels came to be
The Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha: These are the Three Jewels
“Monks, within this teaching that I had not heard previously, I have practiced the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. This I did by focusing intently on the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. In this way my wisdom, vision, understanding, intellect, intelligence, knowledge, and insight became manifest
“Suffering arises based on the aggregates; The water of craving makes it grow
He saw the Bodhisattva, shining with splendor like the central mountain
He was surrounded by millions of gods, demigods, Brahmā, Indra, and the yakṣas; Joyfully they venerated him and showed him the way
Kālika then stood up and, with the nāga daughters, looked in the four directions
“Quick, go get beautiful nāga flowers, fine and sweet-smelling cloths, pearl necklaces, Ornaments and bracelets, powders, and our finest incense
“For many thousands of eons, you have trained well and rested in the suchness of emptiness
You dispense the medicine of the Dharma and know the lives of sentient beings
It is clear that the One Who Practiced Good Conduct for Many Millions of Eons is walking toward the Bodhi tree
Even the rain of warm sand falling on my body feels cool
For a thousand eons you have nourished beings with your thunderous voice
Our minds are filled with joy, and our bodies feel at ease and soothed
“Yet today this house is bright with a beauty that resembles the sun
Neither do the light rays of Indra, Brahmā, or the demigods shine through
The pure light from fire, jewels, lightning, and the stars also do not penetrate this place
Even the far-reaching rays of the sun and moon do not penetrate this place
“Up to now, our isolated home has been filled with darkness as a result of our previous negative actions
there will also be monks who perform many negative deeds and leave aside their obligations as monks.
Please pacify their thirst with the downpour from the rain cloud of the eightfold path
Ānanda then asked, “Blessed One, please tell me how life will turn out for those wicked beings
What will happen as they move from one life to the next?
May your powers, faculties, and concentration make the harvest of liberation bountiful
The Blessed One replied
“Like a compassionate cloud, a lightning bolt of wisdom, and a wind of insight
The light of the Thus-Gone One illuminated hundreds of thousands of buddha realms
causing many hundreds of sons of the buddhas to arrive miraculously
Now all the intentions that you nurtured for a hundred eons have been fulfilled
So now please look upon those beings who are without a protector and turn the supreme wheel.
“Great Sage, please remember your earlier promise
“They will share the fate of those who deny the Buddha’s awakening and those who insult and defame the buddhas, the blessed ones, of the past, present, and future.
When Kālika, the king of the nāgas, saw how the light illumined his own abode, he spoke these verses in front of his retinue
Sage, as you sat below the holy tree, you then tamed Māra and his henchmen
Venerable Ānanda’s hairs stood on end as he exclaimed, “I pay homage to the Buddha!
and awakened to the peace and sacredness of supreme awakening. You felled the tree of disturbing emotions
He then said to the Blessed One
That is why this abode of mine is bright and adorned with this golden light
It is like seeing the stainless and faultless light of Kāśyapa, the Dharma king
Surely a being with supreme features, helpful activity, and wisdom light is here
“Blessed One, when I hear about the conduct of those wicked beings, it almost makes me faint!
“I see a light like that of Krakucchanda, or the brightness of Kanakamuni
Unfold the great victory banner of the Dharma
Blow the great conch of the Dharma
Beat the great drum of the Dharma!
The king of the nāgas became overjoyed and respectfully made offerings to the Supreme One in the world
With devotion he prostrated at the Sage’s feet and stood in front of him
The nāga daughters also joyfully and respectfully venerated the Sage
They scattered flowers, incense, and perfumes, and played music
“Guide! The best in the world! Wonderful to see your face, like the full moon
As I saw the omens foretelling the previous sages, I see the very same signs in you
Today you will conquer Māra’s army and attain your desired state
“This is why in the past you practiced discipline, generosity, and restraint, and gave up all possessions
‘I am the first and the best, I will free all beings from their suffering.
This is why you cultivated discipline, ethical conduct, love, compassion, and the power of forbearance
This is why you were diligent, steadfast, delighting in concentration, and letting your insight blaze
Today all your aspirations will be fulfilled and you shall become victorious
“Since other trees with their leaves, flowers, and fruits bow to the Bodhi tree
Since a thousand vases filled with water circumambulate you
Since hosts of apsarases, overjoyed, make affectionate sounds
Ānanda, one should never attempt to measure the thus-gone ones
Since flocks of swans and cranes playfully take to the sky And joyfully circle clockwise above the Sage, today you will become a worthy one
“Since hundreds of buddha realms are filled with beautiful golden light
Since the lower realms in their entirety come to a halt and the suffering of beings ceases
Since showers fall in the abodes of the sun and the moon, and a soft breeze blows
Today you will become a leader who delivers beings from birth and old age in the three realms
Why not? Because, Ānanda, the thus-gone ones are immeasurable, profound, vast, and difficult to judge
“Since the gods give up their delight in pleasure and come to venerate you
Since Brahmā and the gods of the Brahmapurohita class abandon the bliss of concentration
and the other ones with the title of ‘great lord,’ bowed their heads to the Thus-Gone One’s feet
“Ānanda, when some beings hear sūtras like this one, they become joyful, elated, and full of faith. Those beings obtain something wonderful
And likewise all the others in the three realms arrive here
Their lives become meaningful and their humanity serves a purpose
They all requested the Thus-Gone One to turn the wheel of Dharma with these words
Today you will become the king of physicians who delivers beings from birth and old age in the three realms
Their conduct is excellent and they take hold of what is truly essential
They are freed from the three lower realms
“Rare is the human condition and the arising of a buddha
And extremely rare it is that someone develops faith
It is rare to find freedom from the eight unfortunate states
They become heirs of the thus-gone ones and obtain all that they need
So listening to the Dharma is the most important activity
Their trust is meaningful and they will receive their fair share of the provisions of the kingdom
They will trust deeply in noble beings and cut through Māra’s snares
They will cross over the wastelands of saṃsāra and remove the thorns of misery
“For the last billion eons
You have never heard the Dharma
These beings appear in the world only rarely, and when here they are to be held as proper objects of generosity
This Dharma has been discovered today By one who renounces all mad carelessness
“Our Guide will turn the wheel of immortality, So come quickly, everyone
This voice now urges all of you gods, From the earth up until Brahmā, to come.
It rendered powerful demons powerless and eliminated opposing doctrines
It was hard to measure its profundity and depth
It was a voice praised by the lord of the gods and the lord of the demigods
His voice had a resonance like the voice of Brahmā, or the gushing of waves on the ocean, or the sound of rocks hitting against each other
“Ānanda, those beings do not possess any inferior forms of roots of virtue
It caused no harm but was true, clear, and genuine
Ānanda, those beings are not just companions who befriend me for a few lifetimes only
It sounded like a drum or a melodious chant
His voice was like the call of the cuckoo bird, the kunāla bird, and the partridge
And why is that? Because, Ānanda, some beings are pleased and delighted to hear me, but not to see me
It was a speech that delighted both the body and the mind and cleared away all attachment, anger, delusion, strife, and quarrels
Some, Ānanda, are pleased and delighted to see me, but not to hear me
Still others, Ānanda, are pleased and delighted both to see me and to hear me
Ānanda, whatever the case
when beings are pleased and delighted to see me or hear me, you can be certain that they are friends who have accompanied me for multiple lifetimes
It was enormous with a circumference of seven hundred miles
The Thus-Gone One sees them
and the Thus-Gone One will liberate them
They have the same qualities as the Thus-Gone One
They have gone for refuge in the Thus-Gone One
The Thus-Gone One has accepted them
and the gods adorned the sky above it with parasols, victory flags, banners, and canopies
The gods from the desire and form realms then offered to the Thus-Gone One eight million four hundred thousand lion thrones
Monks, at that time from all directions—east, south, west, and north, above and below—many millions of bodhisattvas who had made previous aspirations for this occasion came forth
“Ānanda, even during earlier times when I was practicing the conduct of a bodhisattva
All the powerful gods in this billionfold universe, such as Śakra, Brahmā, the world protectors
They all bowed down at the feet of the Thus-Gone One and requested him to turn the wheel of Dharma
He has come to Vārāṇasī And will turn the wheel of Dharma
others came to see me, desperate and bound by fear, begging me to protect them from their fears, which I did
“Brahmā and the other gods requested him To turn the wheel of equanimity
So now that I have awakened to perfect and complete buddhahood, I will certainly do the same
Ānanda, strive in faith
the Thus-Gone One urges you thus
Ānanda, the task before you has already been completed by the Thus-Gone One
The Thus-Gone One has pulled out the thorn of pride
It was with such words, spoken in verse, that the Bodhisattva addressed the grass seller Svastika
“Svastika, quick, hand me the grass
“Ānanda, if a person is willing to travel for hundreds of miles just to receive news of a friend and is delighted to hear that news
Today this grass will be very meaningful to me
then how about if they actually meet their friend
Whoever relies on me and generates the roots of virtue will be recognized by the future thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the completely perfect buddhas, who will think, ‘Those beings are the old friends of the thus-gone ones
They are also our friends.
“Why is that? Ānanda, it is because friends please and delight each other
Whoever is dear to one’s friend is also dear and delightful to oneself
Therefore, Ānanda, have trust and understand it to be so
Develop trust and think
‘I also entrust myself to the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the completely perfect buddhas  of the future
“Ānanda, think of this example: Consider a man who is strong and well-regarded but has only one son
Now, if that father has many friends
then even if he should pass away, the friends of the father will still accept the son and not reject him
Ānanda, in the same way, whoever has faith in me, I will accept as my friend
They will take refuge in me
The Thus-Gone One has many friends
Therefore, Ānanda, strive to have faith
That is what I ask of you!
Thus, monks, when the Bodhisattva was born
many trillions of goddesses resting in the center of the sky showered divine flowers, incense, garlands, scented oils, cloths, and jewels upon Māyādevī
Arrived at Lumbinī and spoke to Māyādevī
“Do not be displeased but filled with joy! We are your servants
“Please tell us what to do, what you wish to be done
We are your capable servants, with loving intentions
We beg you to be joyful and abandon all sorrow
Today, queen, you shall give birth with ease To the sublime physician who will overcome sickness and death
“The trees’ buds open, and the sāl trees blossom
Thousands of gods stand before you, bowing their arms
The earth and the sea tremble in six different ways
Thus your son will be known here and in heaven as the Transcendent One
“A pure light beautifies everything, glowing golden
Hundreds of fine instruments resound from the empty sky without being played
A hundred thousand pure, clean gods free from desire joyfully pay homage; Today the One Who Will Benefit the Entire World shall be born
Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, and other gods Stand by, joyfully and happily, with folded hands.
Śakra and Brahmā held out their hands, receiving the Sage
A hundred thousand realms trembled and were suffused with light
The beings of the three lower realms were joyful, their sufferings freed
A hundred thousand gods scattered flowers and waved banners
From the solid earth sprung beautiful lotuses, the nature of vajra
They appeared auspiciously where the Guide placed his wheel-marked feet
He took seven steps and spoke with a melodious voice like Brahmā’s
“I will be a perfect being, a sublime physician who cures old age and death!
Brahmā and Śakra, the supreme gods, hovered in the center of space
They bathed the body of the Guide with pure, clean, and fragrant water
Two nāga kings, dwelling in space, spouted forth two streams of cool and warm water
As well, one hundred thousand gods bathed the Guide’s body with fragrant water
The guardians of the world, with deep respect, held him in their fine hands
When the Guide of the World was born, all suffering and afflictions ceased
Upon the Victorious Guide of Men
The gods showered a cooling rain of flowers
Then the strong and diligent being Took seven steps
Adorned with many jewels, Sprouted forth from the earth
Thus, having taken seven steps
With the melodious voice of Brahmā, he proclaimed, “The sublime physician, dispeller of old age and death, Has now arrived!
Fearlessly he looked in all directions And then spoke meaningfully
“I am the leader of the world
Supreme in this world
“This is my last birth.
Saying this, the Guide of Men smiled
Śakra and the world protectors felt strong faith And bathed the benefactor of the world with the finest scented water
The nāga kings, too, followed suit
Bathing his body with streams of scented water
Ten billion other gods suspended in the sky Also cooled his self-arisen body with streams of delightful scented water
They held aloft vast white parasols and beautiful yak-tail fans
Hovering in space, the gods bathed the body of the leader of men
One man swiftly related the joyful news to Śuddhodana
“O King, great fortune! Your son has been born, adorned with signs
He will certainly be a universal monarch, the jewel of your family lineage
Uniting the victory banners of Jambūdvīpa under one umbrella, he will have no enemies.
Then a second man came and presented himself before Śuddhodana
“O King, great fortune! Now, just as the prince has been born into the Śākya clan
There were , sons born to the Śākya house
All are invincible, strong, and powerful.
Yet another man came and said, “O King, listen to my joyful news
Eight hundred children, headed by Chanda, have been born to the servants
Kaṇṭhaka’s mare birthed ten thousand foals, Perfect horses, glowing golden, with plaited manes and tails
“Twenty thousand fine elephants adorned with golden lattices Have quickly marched to Kapilavastu, trumpeting out their cries
Headed by Gopā, six thousand black-spotted calves have been born
Engendering compassion for the world
The Sage gave his consent
“Keeping his firm promise, He has come to the Deer Park at Vārāṇasī
As the supreme god is born, so are these other beings. How excellent for the kingdom
There he will turn the wheel That is wondrous, glorious, and unsurpassed
“The Lord practiced for a hundred billion eons
“Go, king, look upon all that is yours! Lord of shining merit
He first practiced austerities and hardships Before going to the center of the earth
“He conquered Māra and his army, And gained awakening for the sake of the world
“Leaving the Heaven of Joy
The Lord went to the mother’s womb
Took birth in the Lumbinī Grove
And was lifted up by the husband of Śacī
“With the gait of a lion
He took seven steps and, undistracted
‘I am the most excellent in the world.
Spoke with the voice of Brahmā
“In order to help all beings
He abandoned the four continents and took ordination
Then, from within the array of light, these verses rang out
and saw each other as parents and children
Then King  Śuddhodana arranged a great naming ceremony and announced, “This child’s name is Sarvārthasiddha.
wished each other well
so I will name him Sarvārthasiddha, Fulfiller of All Aims.
Well, immediately when my son was born, all of my aims were fulfilled
Thus all of King Śuddhodana’s intentions were perfectly fulfilled. Then the king wondered, “Now, what shall I name my young son
At that moment there was not a single being anywhere that felt hostile, frightened, or anxious
The entrances to five thousand treasures became visible as they broke forth from the earth
Also for the Bodhisattva’s enjoyment, five hundred parks sprang forth in the area surrounding the city
The five monks prostrated to the Thus-Gone One with their heads at his feet and then sat down before him
Monks, at that point the Thus-Gone One’s body began to emit light rays that filled this trichiliocosm with bright light
Through the power of the Bodhisattva and for his enjoyment, a bodhi tree grew at the center of the four billion regions, while a sandalwood-tree forest grew at the inner region
This light illuminated the inhabitants of the entire world who were steeped in evil and darkness
Monks, at the time of the Bodhisattva’s birth, a great show of generosity was instigated
Moreover, five hundred children of noble family were born
Ten thousand girls, headed by Yaśovatī, were also born
Now even those beings were bathed in light so bright that they immediately saw and acknowledged each other
as well as eight hundred female servants and five hundred male servants, headed by Chanda
Likewise ten thousand mares and ten thousand colts, headed by Kaṇṭhaka, were born
Finally five hundred female elephants and five hundred male elephants were born following the Bodhisattva’s birth. These births were all recorded in registers by King Śuddhodana and given to his young son for entertainment
As thousands of joyous gods and humans see the qualities of the newborn
They set out for perfect awakening beyond suffering And call out, ‘May all be successful!’ 
Monks, although the Bodhisattva had now been born, his mother’s right side was not torn or damaged but had returned to its usual state
Moreover, Trita’s wells manifested with flowing waters, and three ponds of scented oil sprang forth
Then five thousand celestial maidens came before the Bodhisattva’s mother, bringing fragrant oils perfumed with the scent of celestial perfumes
They wanted to know how the birth had gone and whether she was feeling weary
Likewise five thousand celestial maidens bearing unguents came before the Bodhisattva’s mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was weary
when the edge was up, the center was down
when the east was down, the west was up
when the west was up, the east was down
when the north was down, the south was up
Then five thousand celestial maidens bearing vases filled with water scented with celestial perfumes came before the Bodhisattva’s mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was weary
Next five thousand celestial maidens bearing divine children’s clothing came before the Bodhisattva’s mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was weary
when the north was up, the south was down
Then five thousand celestial maidens bearing divine children’s ornaments came before the Bodhisattva’s mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was weary
The world shook so violently that when the edge was down, the center was up
Finally five thousand celestial maidens singing and playing divine instruments came before the Bodhisattva’s mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was weary
It began to quiver, tremble, quake, wobble, thunder, and roar, each in three degrees of intensity
saying, “Oh my, there are other beings here! There really are!” Then the whole trichiliocosm began to shake in six different ways and exhibited eighteen great signs
Then the Thus-Gone One, out of respect to the thus-gone ones of the past
circumambulated the first three thrones and then sat down crossed-legged on the fourth throne like a fearless lion
Monks, at whichever place the previous thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, turned the wheel of Dharma, at that place there appeared one thousand jewel thrones, made of seven kinds of jewels
Monks, after the Thus-Gone One had been refreshed by his bath, he thought to himself
“Where did all the previous thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas, turn the wheel of Dharma?
Monks, right away the five monks bowed at the Thus-Gone One’s fee
and confessed their wrong behavior. In the Thus-Gone One’s presence,  they developed their recognition of him as their teacher, as well as their love, devotion, and respect for him
All of the extremist sages from Jambūdvīpa who possessed the five extraordinary abilities came flying through the sky and arrived before King Śuddhodana
Out of devotion they then gave the Thus-Gone One a refreshing and cleansing bath in a lotus pond with lotuses of many different colors
They called out, “May the king thrive!
Monks, as soon as the Thus-Gone One had uttered these words
every extremist symbol and banner that the five companions were wearing disappeared in an instant
Instead they each now found themselves dressed in the three robes of a mendicant with an alms bowl and their head shaven
Even their behavior was as if they had already been ordained for a hundred years
This truly was their “going forth”; this very ordination became the essence of monkhood
‘Our births have been exhausted
The religious life has been led
That which ought to be done has been done—and nothing else
Monks, the Thus-Gone One indeed sat on the seat that had been arranged
and the five companions, who tried to make  diverse, happy, and pleasing conversation with the Thus-Gone One, sat a little apart
“Monks, you should not address the Thus-Gone One as ‘venerable,
Monks, I have actualized immortality and the path that leads to immortality
He spoke with the strength of the lion’s roar, the neighing of a horse, the trumpeting of an elephant, and with a voice resounding like that of a nāga
His voice was like the clapping of a thundercloud, pervading all buddha realms in the ten directions
It roused all sentient beings in need of guidance
It was unconfused, harmless, and without hesitation
It was appropriate, logical, spoken at the right time, in a timely manner, and contained hundreds of thousands of teachings
It was smooth, unimpeded, and with uninterrupted eloquence
“Venerable Gautama, your senses are calm
and conformed with the teachings of all buddhas
did not ignore his audience, pleased all retinues
He spoke with a single voice, yet was heard in all languages
His voice caused all meanings to be known, produced all types of happiness, demonstrated the path to liberation, proclaimed the accumulations necessary for the path
Don’t help him by holding his robes or his offering bowl
Don’t offer him food or drink for refreshment, nor a place to rest his legs
We can, however, set up some spare seats and say
“The power of forbearance and the power of diligence, The power of concentration and the power of insight‌, The power of merit, the power of realization, and the power of liberation— Today I will accomplish those
The venerable Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya did not agree with this, but he did not voice his opposition, either
“The power of insight‌ and the power of means, The power of miracles and unattached love, The power of correct discernment and complete truth— Today I will accomplish those
“If today you grant me this grass, You shall reap the power of limitless merit
For you this is none other than a sign heralding That you will become an unsurpassed teacher!
Svastika, hearing these beautiful and sweet words spoken by the Guide, Became joyful, elated, and thrilled with delight
Taking a sheaf of soft, fresh, and tender grass, He stood before the Bodhisattva and spoke these words, his heart overflowing with joy
“If this grass can help you attain the supreme state of immortalit
The awakening, supremely peaceful, so hard to find, the path that previous buddhas traverse
“Sir, I do not have any means to pay the crossing fee.
Then please wait a moment, O Great Ocean of Qualities of Immeasurable Glory
I myself shall awaken first to the supreme state of immortality.
The Bodhisattva replied
Then he flew through the air from one shore to the other
“Svastika, without practicing disciplined conduct and austerities for many eons
You will not attain awakening by sitting on a seat of fine grass
Yet when an intelligent person is elevated through the tools of insight‌ and merit
You must come, listen, and apply yourself to the teaching, and then you will become stainless.
he told me that he did not have money to pay the fare
The Guide took a bundle of soft and perfect grass
As he departed with the stride of a lion and a swan, the earth shook
The multitudes of gods and nāgas joined their palms, rejoiced, and thought
“Today he will conquer the hordes of demons and gain immortality!
“I am on my way to Vārāṇasī. When I arrive in the city of Kāśi, I shall spread an incomparable light To shine in this world of the blind
Accordingly, they decided to decorate another eighty thousand bodhi trees
Some of the bodhi trees were made of flowers and were one hundred thousand leagues high
“I am on my way to Vārāṇasī. When I arrive in the city of Kāśi, I shall beat the great drum of nectar To be heard in this world of the deaf
Other bodhi trees were made of odoriferous substances and were two hundred thousand leagues high
Some bodhi trees were made of sandalwood and were three hundred thousand leagues high
Still other bodhi trees were made of cloth and were five hundred thousand leagues high
“I am on my way to Vārāṇasī. When I arrive in the city of Kāśi, I shall turn the wheel of Dharma That has never been turned in this world.
Some bodhi trees were made of jewels and were one million leagues high
Other bodhi trees were made of all sorts of jewels and were one trillion leagues high
At the root of each of these bodhi trees, they erected a suitable lion throne draped in various kinds of divine cloth
By some of the bodhi trees they also prepared a lotus throne, or a throne made of fragrant substances, or a throne made of various precious materials
The Bodhisattva  now rested evenly in the absorption known as playful array
He would not react against the teaching of Dharma.
As soon as the Bodhisattva began to rest in this absorption of playful array
immediately an identical bodhisattva appeared, with his body beautifully adorned with all the excellent marks and representations, sitting upon each of the lion thrones at the root of each of the bodhi trees
Monks, it then occurred to the Thus-Gone One, “Ārāḍa Kālāma is pure and has all the other qualities
At that point the bodhisattvas and the gods each perceived that the Bodhisattva was resting in equilibrium upon their particular lion throne and not on those set forth by the others
Monks, the Thus-Gone One again thought
“Now, where could there be another being who is pure and easy to train? Who would have all these qualities and not react against the teaching of Dharma?
The power of the Bodhisattva’s absorption of playful array produced similar perceptions in the beings in hell
those born as animals
To him I would have explained this Dharma for the first time, and he would not have turned against me.
those living in the realm of the lord of death
all gods and humans
and all other beings, regardless of their form of existence. All beings now witnessed the Bodhisattva sitting on the lion throne at the root of the Bodhi tree
“Lord, that is how it is. Bliss-Gone One, that is how it is. Rudraka, the son of Rāma, died just one week ago.
Nevertheless, in order to also satisfy the intellect of those who lacked dedication, the Bodhisattva picked up the bundle of grass
went to the Bodhi tree, and circumambulated it seven times
The Lord then arranged the grass so that the ends of the grass pointed inward and the roots pointed outward
In this way he arranged for himself a very fine seat of grass
like a hero
in a powerful way
in a steady way
like an elephant
like a lord
in a natural manner
like a wise person
like an unsurpassed person
like a special one
like an exalted one
like a famous one
like one full of praise
like a generous person
like a disciplined person
like a concentrated person
like an insightful being
in a wise manner
in a meritorious manner
like someone who has conquered the attacks of demons
and like someone who has perfected the accumulations. In this way he sat down on the grass seat and crossed his legs facing toward the east
He then straightened his back, collected himself one-pointedly, and formed this firm resolve
in a diligent way, in a forceful way
like a forbearing person, like a diligent person
At the same time Lalitavyūha made it so that the Bodhisattva, who was sitting at the seat of awakening, became visible to all sentient beings living in the five types of existences
Monks, as the Bodhisattva sat down at the seat of awakening
the gods of the six classes within the desire realm decided to protect the Bodhisattva from obstacles
These gods therefore took position in the eastern direction
Likewise the southern, western, and northern directions were taken over by other classes of gods
This concludes the nineteenth chapter, on approaching the seat of awakening
I will not move my body from this seat.
Yet until I attain awakening, so hard to find even through many eons
“On this seat my body may wither and rot, And my skin, my bones, and my flesh may dissolve
illuminating all the boundless and immeasurable buddha realms—the realms that filled the entire field of phenomena
Monks, when the Bodhisattva sat down at the seat of awakening, he began to emit a light known as inspiring the bodhisattvas. The light shone in all the ten directions
Then the Bodhisattva emanated other bodhisattvas in front of everyone
The forms of these bodhisattvas then sang this verse
“He is someone free from attachment, anger, stains and their habitual tendencies
Light shines from his body in the ten directions, outshining all other lights
For many eons he increased the accumulations of merit, absorption, and wisdom
Śākyamuni, the most illustrious of great sages, now beautifies all places.
He thus saw that sentient beings were grouped into three categories
saw sentient beings that were base, mediocre, and advanced; those that were high, low, and middling
“May all these beings who endure pain for so long, Including gods, renunciants, and priests, Be healthy and free of fever
At that point, this verse was heard from the jewel parasol
Now that you have surely reached the other shore
O Protector, please liberate sentient beings that have attained this opportunity
“Gods and humans have been following you for so long
May you train sentient beings that have long since strayed from the path
This offering is for him, the master of good qualities, who has gone to the Bodhi tree!
Is the benefactor endowed with the best marks, with strength like Nārāyaṇa
Yearning for nectar with the virtuous thought
They have longed to hear meanings unheard, Like the feeble long to be nourished
“Therefore we supplicate you, with your power so dynamic and benevolent
‘May the Dharma be proclaimed, the Dharma which is no less than Exactly what the Victorious One understands!
“In your previous existences you had the thought, ‘Once I myself have crossed, I will ferry others across!
At that point, this verse was heard from the jewel canopy
“He is a jewel mine, a jewel banner, and a delight to the three worlds
He is the best of gems, renowned as a jewel, who delights in the true Dharma
He has the diligence by which he will never be cut off from the Three Jewels
This is to venerate the One Who Is About to Attain Supreme Awakening.
In the northern direction
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he revealed within the courtyard the complete displays of qualities of all buddha realms contained in all the worlds in the ten directions
At that point, this verse was heard from each of the displays
“The enormity of his merit and wisdom has purified his body
His disciplined action, austerities, and truthful Dharma have purified his speech
His conscientiousness, devotion, love, and compassion have purified his mind
This is to venerate him, the Leader of the Śākyas, who has gone to the king of trees.
The cloud then resounded with this verse
“He, shining with the light of confidence in knowledge, spreads the cloud of Dharma all throughout the three realms
He, free from attachment, makes the sacred Dharma—the nectar that takes beings beyond suffering—fall like rain
He will cut the fettering vines of attachment and negative emotions, along with their habitual tendencies
And blossoming forth with concentration, miracles, powers, and strengths, he will grant to beings a fount of faith.
Then, in the northeastern direction
Each of these manifestations of bodhisattvas held up flower garlands from both the human and divine realms. They all bowed to the Bodhisattva and, as they offered the flower garlands, they sang this verse
“Who praised a million buddhas And respectfully developed great faith? Who speaks with a beautiful voice, like the melody of Brahmā
To him, who now has arrived at the seat of awakening, I bow.
“My path, going against the stream, is profound
It is difficult to see, Since those blinded by desire do not see it
In the quarter above
Monks, at these words the Thus-Gone One repeated to Great Top-Knotted Brahmā
Understood only by the clever and the wise, it is out of step with all worldly people and difficult to see
And these verses, O Brahmā, are my reply to you, time and again
Great Top-Knotted Brahmā once again became aware of this thought of the Thus-Gone One
and he went to see Śakra, lord of the gods
When he arrived, he told Śakra, lord of the god
At this sight the Bodhisattva left the road
and he went to the grass seller Svastika and spoke to him with sweet words
His words were authoritative, informative, and clear
Then the sages make a prediction and say, ‘You will later become a stainless victorious one.
In the western direction
“How come this jewel parasol appeared? Whose karmic result is this?
Indra, Brahmā, and the world protectors now said to each other
In the southern direction
Surrounded and escorted by an infinite number of bodhisattvas
he proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting
The gods in all directions,  together with the nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas, said to each other
“Who created this display of light?
Seeing this, some bodhisattvas asked each other, “Who created such displays?
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he sheltered the entire area with a single jewel canopy
In the southeastern direction
the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Guṇamati, who resided in the Guṇākarā world of the Thus-Gone One Guṇa­rāja­prabhāsa’s buddha realm. Surrounded and escorted by an infinite number of bodhisattvas, he proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he miraculously emanated within the sacred area a multistoried palace endowed with all perfect qualities. The members of Guṇamati’s retinue asked, “Who has created such a display?” The multistoried palace then resounded with this verse
“It is merely a trace of his qualities That the gods, demigods, yakṣas, and mahoragas will ever possess
With such traits he was born into a royal family of many qualities. Now this Ocean of Qualities sits under the branches of the Bodhi tree.
Then, in the southwestern direction
Then from these celestial pavilions, this verse was heard
he proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he manifested a cloud of gum benjamin and aloeswood above the sacred area and caused a rain of sandalwood dust to fall
the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Hema­jālālaṃkṛta, who resided in the Hema­jāla­pratichannā world of the Thus-Gone One Ratnacchatrābhyudgatāvabhāsa’s buddha realm. Surrounded and escorted by an infinite number of bodhisattvas
illuminated the area surrounding the fig tree with their divine beauty and their divine luminosity
the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Ratnacchattra­kūṭa­saṃdarśana, who resided in the world Ratnavyūhā of the Thus-Gone One Ratnārcis’ buddha realm
Surrounded and escorted by an infinite number of bodhisattvas
he proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting. As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he sheltered the entire area with a single jewel parasol
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he displayed lotuses made of gold from the Jambū River within the beryl maṇḍala
The entire Śākya clan gathered, and everyone called out with delight, practiced generosity,  engaged in merit, and satisfied the needs of , priests each day
Everyone felt full of joy and happiness, and no one made anyone afraid or caused anyone harm
This can also be expressed in verse
They gave anything that was desired to whoever desired it
Some offer a million necklaces; They arrive in the sky, loud like thunder
Some display flowers and palaces in the expanse of space
They arrive with jewel diadems adorning their hair
Some proclaim emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness
As they arrive on the ground, they roar like lions
Some scatter beautiful flowers never seen before
As they arrive, they roar like bulls
Some reveal their bodies in a thousand colors
As they arrive in space, they cry like peacocks
Some proclaim the garlands of qualities of the son of the Bliss-Gone Ones
As they arrive in space, they are like the full moon
Some, like the sun, send forth rays of light
Śakra and Brahmā also manifested themselves in the form of young priests within that gathering of priests and, sitting at the head of the line, they sang these verses of auspiciousness
As they arrive, they make all the abodes of Māra appear dark
and approached the Thus-Gone One
They bowed their heads to the feet of the Thus-Gone One
A light of merit has certainly appeared
“The blind can see again
Some who have gathered the accumulation of merit Arrive at the seat of awakening, bright as rainbows
The deaf can hear again
The insane have had their sanity restored
He will become an object of worship for the world
“Since, unharmed by negative emotions
And all flowing rivers are still
“Since all fires have died out
Some proffer the central mountain on the palms of their hands As they remain in midair, scattering flowers from baskets
Thus he will become the great leader
Some bring the four oceans on top of their heads
Yet they are without animosity toward one another
As they arrive, they scatter and sprinkle perfume on the ground
And gods can see humans
“Humans can see the gods
Some hold up various jewel staffs; As they arrive, they point out the Bodhisattva from afar
Some, like Brahmā, have peaceful forms; Their peaceful minds rest calmly and their concentration is firm
He will become worthy of veneration
Join their palms and bow down
Who are free of desire
As they arrive, the pores of their bodies resonate with the beautiful sounds Of limitless love, compassion, joy, and equanimity
“As the hundred gods living in the form realm
He will become the king of physicians
Some arrive like the god Indra; They come surrounded by millions of gods
At the Bodhi tree they join their palms And scatter jewels like the ones possessed by Indra
Some arrive like the guardians of the four directions, Surrounded by gandharvas, rākṣasas, and kiṃnaras
Like lightning, they bring down a rain of luminous flowers, And praise the heroic one with the voice of gandharvas and kiṃnaras
It is the exhaustion of craving
Some arrive with heavenly trees in bloom, With fruits, flowers, and perfect scents
Among the leaves, the upper bodies of the buddhas’ offspring are visible
“Since gentle fragrant breezes Perfumed with divine incense Pacify the illnesses of beings
“Since the world is calm And great lotuses have sprouted forth, Certainly this splendorous one Will be the protector of the world
“As sāl trees blossom And the earth is even, Certainly he will become omniscient, The recipient of offerings of all the world
The minds of beings are filled with love, It is certain, without a doubt, That he will become worthy of the offerings of ten million Brahmās
They bow to the center of the world and scatter flowers
Some arrive in bodies as big as the central mountain
And the earth sways gently
Standing in midair, they cast off their bodies
He will be one who sees the truth!
Monks, seven days after the Bodhisattva was born
Immediately they transform into fresh flower garlands
And cover the realms of the victorious ones in all the trichiliocosm
the time came for Māyādevī to pass away
it is out of step with all worldly people and difficult to see
Upon her death, she was born among the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
Monks, you may think that it was because of the Bodhisattva that Māyādevī died
It is the abandonment of all aggregates, the cessation of all formations
From their bodies many Dharma gates are heard
Causing millions of beings to abandon craving
Understood only by the clever and the wise
But you should not look upon things that way
They appear like maidens, well adorned with necklaces
and beyond the intellect
The gods who view them cannot get enough
Some arrive with indestructible, vajra-like bodies
hard to comprehend, inconceivable
They wade through the waters below
Monks, seven days after the bodhisattvas of the past were born, their mothers also died
Monks, in order to engender respect for the Dharma in the world
in order to increase the root of virtue by having Great Top-Knotted Brahmā repeatedly request the Dharma
In order to benefit, delight, and satisfy many sentient beings
They bring down a rain of scented and perfect jewel flowers
Monks, seven days earlier Māyādevī had gone in great pomp from the city of Kapilavastu to the pleasure grove. However, with a splendor one trillion times greater than that, the Bodhisattva now entered the city of Kapilavastu
When he entered, five thousand vases filled with scented water were carried ahead of him
Likewise five thousand maidens carrying fans made of peacock feathers walked ahead
Their sound goes out to millions of realms everywhere
and had the following thought
“The Teacher is poised to awaken today, and subsequently to attain immortality!
and because the Dharma is exceedingly profound, the Thus-Gone One once again went into the privacy of solitud
This concludes the twentieth chapter, on the displays at the seat of awakening
Five thousand maidens waving palm fronds preceded them, and farther ahead came five thousand maidens holding golden vases of scented water, who sprinkled this water upon the path
Indeed, once Great Top-Knotted Brahmā understood that this Thus-Gone One had silently acquiesced
the other bodhisattvas manifested many such displays at the seat of awakening
The Bodhisattva himself, however, caused all the displays that ornamented all the seats of awakening of the past
present, and future buddhas in all the buddha realms in the ten directions to become visible right there at the seat of awakening
Monks, as the Bodhisattva now sat at the seat of awakening, he thought to himself
he anointed the Thus-Gone One with divine sandalwood powder and divine aloeswood powder, became joyful and ecstatic
and then vanished that very instant
“Māra is the supreme lord who holds sway over the desire realm, the most powerful and evil demon
Then came five thousand maidens holding fine jewels and sweeping the path
There is no way that I could attain unsurpassed and complete awakening without his knowledge
So I will now arouse that evil Māra
Once I have conquered him, all the gods in the desire realm will also be restrained
Farther ahead walked five thousand maidens carrying beautiful cushions, and  five thousand priests carrying bells and ringing out sounds of auspiciousness
Moreover, there are some gods in Māra’s retinue who have previously created some basic goodness
When they witness my lion-like display, they will direct their minds toward unsurpassed and complete awakening.
Monks, in order to show kindness to the world of gods, humans, and nonhumans
In front of them there were five thousand beautifully decorated elephants
Monks, as soon as the Bodhisattva had this thought, a light known as the light which conquers all demonic congregations was emitted from the hair between his eyebrows
The light illuminated all demonic abodes in the entire great trichiliocosm, making them dark by comparison and causing them to shake
the Thus-Gone One looked upon this world with compassion and silently acquiesced to Great Top-Knotted Brahmā
Then came twenty thousand horses covered with golden ornaments and full of jewels
In fact the entire great trichiliocosm was bathed in an immense light
From this light a voice called out to Māra, the evil one
“Here is a pure being who has acted well for many eons
As Śuddhodana’s son he abandoned his kingdom
He appeared as a benefactor seeking immortality
He has arrived at the Bodhi tree, so you should now make an effort
“Himself having crossed, he causes others to cross
Himself liberated, he also liberates others
Having found relief, he gives relief to others
Having passed beyond suffering, he will cause others to transcend suffering
O King of Dharma, I beseech you
“He will empty the three lower realms totally, And fill the city of gods and humans
“Recruiting all the gods
In the world of Brahmā, in the world of gods
“He will empty your city, O evil kinsman; With your army powerless, you will be without an army and without allies
Or in the worlds of yakṣas, gandharvas, or human
Who will remove birth and death from the worlds
“There is no one but you, O Protector, Moon among Men
Monks, Māra, the evil one, was aroused by these verses and had a dream with thirty-two omens
What are these thirty-two? They are as follows
May you, O Lord, cleanse the sublime eye of Dharma For beings who are blind from birth
“May you open the gates to liberation! May you explain the inalienable way of Dharma
Alas, Blessed One, this world is really doomed
Following the Bodhisattva were eighty thousand chariots beautifully outfitted with lattices of golden bells, and with parasols, victory banners, and flags hoisted
Then came forty thousand imposing foot soldiers and heroes wearing strong armor
Uncountable billions of gods of the desire and form realms, hovering in the sky, made various types of offerings to the Bodhisattva and followed after him
The Bodhisattva himself rode in a chariot, which the gods of the desire realm had decorated with a great array of ornaments
Nor were the human maidens overwhelmed by the sight of the beautiful celestial maidens
Monks, in the city of Kapilavastu, five hundred Śākyas had constructed five hundred homes for the Bodhisattva
When the Bodhisattva entered the city
“Having accomplished the orb of supreme great wisdom
Radiating light rays throughout the ten directions
Your wisdom rays could bring lotus-like people to bloom
So then why today, Sun of Speech, do you remain indifferent
“Coaxing sentient beings with the wealth of the noble ones
You could soothe many tens of millions of creatures
“Sarvārthasiddha, please come here
God of Gods, please come here
Pure Being, please come here
May you ferry across all those wallowing in the ocean of existence
Sublime Captain, please come here
May you liberate all those afflicted with severe illness
Bringer of Pleasure, Joy, and Rapture, please come here
You Who Are Renowned as Being beyond Reproach, please come here
All-Seeing One, please come here
When he saw that they had gathered along with his armies, his retinue, his generals, and his gatekeepers, he addressed them with these verses
Peerless One beyond Equal, with your splendor, qualities
When Māra saw these omens, he became worried
May you light the great lamp of the Dharma
and body adorned with the major and minor signs, please come here!
He summoned  the demon captain Siṃhahanu And his sons and his retinue
May you erect the great sacrificial post of the Dharma
May you blow the conch shell of the genuine Dharma
“May you beat the kettledrum of the sublime Dharma
King Śuddhodana wanted to make everyone happy, so he took the Bodhisattva into all the houses
In this way it took four months before the Bodhisattva entered his actual residence, the palace known as Display of Gems
That you silently remain indifferent to the world
‘A being was born among the Śākyas adorned with perfect marks
May you quell those tormented by the fires of afflictions
He practiced severe austerities for six years
“May you teach the path to peace
“May you rain down the waters of Dharma, most sublime
It is not suitable, O Friend of the World
Joyous, auspicious, imperishable, and without sorrow
Such being the case, O Blessed One, please eloquently teach the Dharma
Please, O Bliss-Gone One, teach the Dharma!
Then Brahmā spoke these verses
There are intelligent beings of good disposition with the potential, fortune, and ability to comprehend the meaning of what the Blessed One says
Have compassion, O Protector, for those on the wrong path; They are helpless, since they are not traveling on the path to nirvāṇa
Five hundred Śākya women came to volunteer, saying, “I will care for the prince
“For immeasurable hundreds of thousands of eons
Please let me take care of the prince.
I emulated the previous victorious ones
The eldest male and female Śākyas then argued, “All of these women are impetuous young girls, who are vain and proud because of their beauty and youth. Such women are incapable of caring for the prince and his needs
However, the prince’s maternal aunt Mahāprajāpati Gautamī would be able to raise the prince so that he is happy and well
She will also be able to please King Śuddhodana.
Since everyone agreed with this suggestion
they encouraged Mahāprajāpati Gautamī to take on this task
And indeed Mahāprajāpati Gautamī raised the prince well
At that time thirty-two additional nurses were appointed to serve the Bodhisattva
Of these, eight would carry him
eight were nursemaids
eight were playmates
and eight were appointed to bathe him
King Śuddhodana then gathered all of the Śākyas for a council and asked
“Will this prince be a universal monarch or will he instead depart from here as a renunciant?
If you wish to please me, do not delay this
Quick, mobilize the four army divisions
We shall destroy that monk, alone at the king of trees
“Come on! Let us advance with a great army
When he attains immortality and reaches the cool state, He will empty all our abodes
“If the Bodhisattva becomes awakened, all by himself He will awaken billions of beings
“Although the world may be full of worthy ones and solitary buddhas, My force will remain unharmed when they pass beyond suffering
Yet if he alone becomes a victorious one and a Dharma king
Monks, at that time the Thus-Gone One radiated light from the center of his forehead, which illuminated the entire trichiliocosm with its brilliance
He would never allow the line of uncountable victorious ones to be broken.
Monks, at that point the son of Māra, the evil one, who was named Sārthavāha, addressed his father in these verses
“Father, why is your face so sad and pale
Your heart is thumping and your every limb is shaking
Come now, tell me quick, what did you hear or witness
Let us discover the truth and devise a plan.
With his pride vanished, Māra said: “Son, listen to me
I had a bad dream, extremely terrifying
If I were to tell everything now to the audience here, You would faint and fall to the ground.
However, for the one who is killed, there is detriment
If your dream conveys an omen of this kind
“One with a determined mind will win in battle
If we rely on firmness and correct action, victory will be ours
The evil kinsman then conferred with all of them
Then, by means of the Buddha’s power, Great Top-Knotted Brahmā, lord of the trichiliocosm, became aware of the Thus-Gone One’s notion
“An army may be vast, but if it is weak, A single powerful hero may win the battle
Even if the universe were filled with fireflies, They could be destroyed and eclipsed by a single sun
“Moreover: He who is proud and ignorant does not have much acumen
With his divine eye, he looked all over Jambūdvīpa and saw that a prince had been born to King Śuddhodana in the city of Kapilavastu. It was a prince who shone with the light of merit
who was worshiped by everyone
If he is opposed to a shrewd person, he will not be able to think effectively.
and whose body was beautifully adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being
Monks, Māra, the evil one, did not pay heed to Sārthavāha’s warning
Instead, he gathered all four divisions of his great and powerful army
He said to the young priest Naradatta
“Young priest, listen
It was a terrifying army, so brave in battle that it would make anyone’s hair stand on end
Having understood that the Blessed One was set on keeping the Dharma to himself without teaching it
A jewel has come into this world
he thought
In the city of Kapilavastu, in the household of King Śuddhodana, a prince has been born. He shines with the light of merit, is worshiped by everyone, and is beautifully adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being
Such an army had never been seen before, or even heard of, in the realms of gods and humans
The soldiers were able to transform their faces in a trillion ways
If he remains in his palace, he will become a universal monarch who commands the four armies
“I will most certainly approach and solicit the Thus-Gone One to turn the wheel of Dharma!
On their arms and legs slithered hundreds of thousands of snakes
and in their hands they brandished swords, bows, arrows, darts, lances, axes, tridents, clubs, staffs, bludgeons, lassos, cudgels, discuses, vajras, and spears
Their bodies were covered in finest cuirasses and armor
So right then Great Top-Knotted Brahmā addressed the other gods of the Brahma realms
Some had their heads, hands, or feet turned backward, or their eyes facing backward
Their heads, eyes, and faces were ablaze
He will be a victorious and pious Dharma king with the necessary strength to govern
He will also have seven precious possessions, which are the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious wife, the precious jewel, the precious steward, and the precious minister
Their bellies, hands, and feet were deformed, and their faces brimmed with vehement ardor
Their mouths, with protruding ugly fangs, appeared contorted in the extreme, and their thick and broad tongues, rough like a turtle’s neck or a straw mat, dangled from their mouths
“Friends! Even though the Thus-Gone One has awakened to unsurpassable, perfect and complete buddhahood, he is set on keeping the Dharma to himself without teaching it
Like the eyes of a black snake, which are flush with poison, their eyes were blazing red, as if on fire
Some of them were vomiting poisonous snakes
while others, like garuḍas emerging from the ocean, grasped these poisonous snakes in their hands and ate the
Alas! This world is doomed
In this way the entire world will be his kingdom
Alas, O friends, this world is really doomed
If, however, he leaves his home and goes forth as a renunciant, he will become a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a completely perfect buddha
Thus we must surely go and solicit the worthy one, the perfectly and completely awakened Thus-Gone One, to turn the wheel of Dharma.
He will become a teacher and a guide who is independent of others and renowned throughout the world
So come, let us go and see him.
Some had ugly hollow eyes, like wells
“It would only be suitable to bring forth this Dharma of mine If Brahmā were to fall at my feet
When he arrived, he concealed his magical powers and entered the city on foot
These beings all have faith in Brahmā
He went to the palace of King Śuddhodana and walked right up to the palace gates where, monks, he saw many hundreds of thousands of animals gathered
“With my infinite compassion for the whole world, I do not hesitate when others supplicate me
The sage Asita went to the gatekeeper and told him
Soft and supple, it looked perfectly youthful
Its nails were exquisite and copper colored
The hand’s fingers were connected by a web
And if there were intelligent beings of good disposition.
Supplicating me to explain the stainless and sublime Dharma
“Sir! Go and tell King Śuddhodana that a sage has come to see him.
Thus, when he supplicates, I will turn the wheel of Dharma
disturbance, and perturbation
King Śuddhodana had a seat prepared for the sage Asita and said to the gatekeeper
“Let the sage enter.
Just as a Magadhan brass cauldron, when struck with a wooden log, chimes and reverberates,  so did this great earth sound and reverberate when struck by the Bodhisattva with his hand
Then the earth goddess in this great trichiliocosm who is called Sthāvarā, along with her retinue of one billion earth goddesses, began to shake the entire great earth
May you rule in accord with the Dharma!
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then accepted the alms bowl from the great king Vaiśravaṇa, regarding him with compassion
May you live long
“Great King, may you be victorious! May you be victorious
The sage Asita went before King Śuddhodana and told him
The gatekeeper returned from the king’s quarters and told the sage Asita to enter the palace
King Śuddhodana first honored the sage by giving him water to bathe his feet and rinse his mouth
Having thus accepted it, he then spoke in verse to the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra
“Whoever gives an alms bowl to the Thus-Gone On
and he knew that these marks could only indicate one of two possibilities
Will never be bereft of mindfulness and insight
He saw that the Bodhisattva’s body bore the thirty-two marks of a great being
Then Māra, the evil one, spoke to his daughters
and circumambulated him. He then took the Bodhisattva on his lap and remained pensive
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then accepted the begging bowl from the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra, regarding him with compassion
“Girls, you must go now to the seat of awakening and examine the Bodhisattva. Does he have desires or not
He stood up from his seat, joined his palms, prostrated to the Bodhisattva’s feet
Is he deluded or intelligent
Having accepted it, he spoke in verse to the great king Virūḍhaka
Is he like a blind man, or does he know the country and seek advantage
And is he weak or strong?
When they heard these words, these divine maidens went to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was
Oh! An amazing being has been born in this world
They assembled in front of the Bodhisattva and began displaying the thirty-two ways of female trickery
What are these thirty-two ways? They are as follows
Some of the girls partially covered their faces
“Give a pristine begging bowl To the Thus-Gone One, pure in mind, And you will swiftly become pure in mind
Some showed off their firm and voluptuous breasts
Worthy of veneration in the world.
Some smiled at him and flashed their teeth
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then accepted the alms bowl from the great king Virūḍhaka, regarding him with compassion
Some lifted their arms, waving them in the air to reveal their armpits
Some flaunted their lips, red like bimba fruit
Having accepted it, he spoke to the great king Virūpākṣa in verse
he saw that his body was wonderfully adorned with the thirty-two marks and eighty signs of a great being. His body was superior even to that of Śakra, Brahmā, and the guardians of the world
Some looked at the Bodhisattva through half-closed eyes and then quickly closed their eyes
When the sage Asita looked at the Bodhisattva
Some showed off their half-covered breasts
“Give, with faultless intention and devotion, A faultless vessel to the Thus-Gone One, Who is faultless in discipline and conduct
And your merit of generosity will be faultless.
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then accepted the alms bowl from the great king Virūpākṣa, regarding him with compassion
Like the lord of elephants, he slowly walked about
King Śuddhodana carefully lifted Prince Sarvārthasiddha with both hands and carried him before the sage Asita
The earth trembled in six ways, And then this lion among men rose, with the movements of a lion
Monks, out of affection for the sage Asita, the Bodhisattva now showed signs of having awakened
This wise one, with insight into ultimate reality, Gazed at the supreme tree of awakening for seven nights
Great beings like him usually remain awake.
She made a great display of her myriad powers and then disappeared together with her following there and then
“Great King, a great being like this does not sleep long
When the wicked one and his army heard that sound from the earth
The sage replied
“Great Sage, the child is sleeping now. Please wait for a short while until he wakes.
“Since, in a previous existence, I offered alms bowls
Filling them with fruit and making them lovely
The king said
and then said this meaningful verse
“Great King, I have come to see the son who was born to you.
When he had accepted it, he transformed all four alms bowls into one through the power of his wish
The sage Asita replied to King Śuddhodana
And will spend his time happily at ease Until awakening to the state of cool repose.
Now Māra, the evil one, felt unhappy and full of suffering
And eventually reached the trunk of a fig tree
Some loosened their clothes to reveal their hips adorned with girdles
Some wore fine, transparent clothes that revealed their hips and their girdles
Some showed their arms, which had been rubbed with perfume
Some displayed their earrings anointed with perfume
Some covered their face with a veil and then suddenly revealed it
Some of them showed off their virgin bodies that had never given birth
At that time the two brothers Trapuṣa and Bhallika, With their caravan of merchants And carriages filled with riches, Reached a grove of sāl trees in full bloom
“Our voices are soft and our scent is delicious; Our faces look their best with diadems, earrings, and makeup
Instantly, through the Great Sage’s radiance
The wheels sunk into the earth up to their axles
Seeing such a situation
“Great King, if you look in our scriptures, you will see that the prince Sarvārthasiddha will not stay at home
The merchant caravan was terrified
Carrying swords, arrows, and spears, They inquired who was dwelling in the forest like a deer
They saw the Victorious One, who was like the sun in a cloudless sky And whose face was like an autumn moon
The reason is, Great King, that the prince Sarvārthasiddha bears the thirty-two marks of a great being
And what are these marks
Without hostility or pride
They bowed down, wondering who he was
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha has a crown protuberance
A deity said from the sky
That, Great King, is the first mark of a great being found on Prince Sarvārthasiddha
“He is a buddha acting for the welfare of the world
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha’s hair is deep blue like the neck of a peacock or kohl powder, and curls to the right
His forehead is even
Great King, at the place between Sarvārthasiddha’s eyebrows, there is a ringlet of hair the color of snow or silver
His eyes are of a deep blue color
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha has the voice of Brahmā
His experience of taste is unexcelled
The great sage Asita replied to the king
His tongue is very long and slender
“Great King, I am not crying for sake of the prince
His jaw is like that of a lion
and no misfortune will befall him
His shoulders are well-rounded
I cry for myself because
Monks, at that time the herd of cows belonging to the merchants Trapuṣa and Bhallika was grazing at a neighboring village
His chest is broad
His skin is smooth and golden
Great King, I am elderly, old, and decrepit
When standing up straight, his hands reach his knees
His torso is like that of a lion
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha’s arm span and height are identical, like the banyan tree
Each of his hairs grows individually, and their tips curl to the right and upward
His private parts are well sheathed
His thighs are well-rounded
His calves are like those of the black antelope, the king of deer
His fingers are long
His heels are broad
His arches are high
His palms and the soles of his feet are soft
His fingers and toes are webbed
Great King, on the palms of his long-fingered hands and on the soles of his long-toed feet, there are beautiful thousand-spoked wheels with both center and rim
There the cows were milked and yielded clarified butter
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha has even and well-placed feet
“Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha possesses these thirty-two marks of a great being
these are the marks found on the body of a bodhisattva
“Great King, the body of Prince Sarvārthasiddha is adorned with eighty minor marks
Because he has these signs, Prince Sarvārthasiddha will not stay at home, but will certainly develop renunciation and depart from his home
Great King, what are these eighty minor marks
“In the divine realm you, like Śakra, will be surrounded by divine maidens; In the Heaven Free from Strife, the Heaven Fully Free from Strife, and the Heaven of Joy, you will be praised by the best of immortals
His veins are not visible
His anklebones are not visible
His joints are not visible
His feet are even, rather than uneven
His heels are broad
“It is possible that someone can make drawings in the empty sky, Or catch the blowing wind with a lasso, Or make the bright sun and moon fall from the sky to the earth
They played music and sang, “Sit at the tree, O Hero, O Lion Who Conquers His Enemies
They offered garlands of pearls, crescent moons, parasols, flags, and banners, And showered him with flowers and powders of aloe, tagara, and sandalwood
Only wise noble ones and adepts can understand it
It is the complete and definitive apprehension of the abandonment of all aggregates
His lips are red like the bimba fruit
“A fool who offends against those who are faultless Shall himself meet with many troubles— Fear, suffering, calamities, misery, Lamentation, murder, and bondage.
His voice is not loud
His tongue is supple, soft, and copper colored
Māra replied
“I did not listen to the kind and helpful advice of my sons, And offended against a perfectly pure being
Therefore I now reap suffering, fear, misfortune, grief, ruin, Lamentation, loss of honor, and this miserable state.
“Quick, get up! You must depart without delay
For this is what happens to those who pay no heed to the words of the Master.
She took her vase with water and sprinkled the friend of darkness
his arms are long
The goddess in the tree felt compassion
He is excellently clean
For seven days they did not see each other, And when they finally did see their phantasmal forms, they said, “Great to see you alive.
The great army of demons, so utterly unshakable, Was now all gone, dispersed, and no more together
“Such suffering has befallen us, and there are no prospects for living.
And in this way they started to argue and fight with each other
the end of all sensations
the absolute truth, and freedom from a foundation
That which has no existence cannot be found
His body is soft
For one who knows the chain of causation and action
Hear about this truth, they develop confidence in it. “No Dharma at all exists here
Yet when sentient beings, whom previous victorious ones took under their care
“This meaning cannot be understood through words; Rather it is comprehended through reaching their limit
His body is not subject to fear or hesitancy
His kneecaps are broad, large, and well-developed
Monks, this was indeed how, during the first station of the night, the Bodhisattva actualized knowledge, removed darkness, and lit the light
In this manner, with his pristine divine eye beyond that of humans, the Bodhisattva saw sentient beings dying and being born, in all their beauty and ugliness, in favorable and unfavorable circumstances, degenerating and advancing, respectively, precisely in accordance with their actions
Like a sage, he is very pure in his conduct
He is exceedingly attractive
“Great King,  Prince Sarvārthasiddha moves with the serene gait of an elephant
the stride of a lion
and imperceptible like emptiness
the step of a great bull
the swoop of a swan
His steps always make beautiful circles to the right
As they engage in the actions associated with wrong views, once their bodies collapse and they die, they fall into bad migrations and are born among the hell realms
It is the exhaustion of craving and it is cessation free of desire. It is nirvāṇa
Harboring wrong views, they revile the noble ones
“Alas! Sentient beings engage in negative physical, verbal, and mental conduct
If I were to teach this truth to others, they would not understand it
His waist is slight like the curve of a bow
His body is free of any blemishes or dark spots
Teaching the truth would tire me out and be wrongly contested, and it would be futile
Great King,  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has rounded canines
His canines are sharp and well spaced
His nose is elegantly high
And further I accurately understood the precise identity of formations, the source of formations, the cessation of formations, and the path leading to their cessation
I understood where exactly all ignorance without exception vanishes and disappears
I accurately understood the identity of ignorance, the source of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the path leading to its cessation
His sense organs are clearly apparent
Great King,  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has a perfect tuft of hair between his brows
May we all, rejoicing, aspire to omniscience! As we attain the sublime and peerless awakening that all buddhas praise
“Here with the plowshare of trenchant insight, I uprooted all the root afflictions Along with their latent formations, Which yield suffering and anguish
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha has all of these eighty marks
“Great King, these eighty marks that Prince Sarvārthasiddha bears mean that Prince Sarvārthasiddha will not remain in his home
but will certainly leave the palace in order to live the life of a renunciant.
When King Śuddhodana heard the sage Asita’s prophecy about the prince, he rejoiced and felt satisfied, elated, joyful, and blissful
He rose from his seat, prostrated at the feet of the Bodhisattva, and spoke this verse
“All the gods prostrate to you
The sages give you offerings
And the entire world worships you
So I will also offer you my homage.
If you want to assuage your own afflictions, Feed this cultivated body and mind!
Then the great sage Asita returned to his own abode by magically flying through the air
“For seven days and nights, This embodiment of compassion has not consumed food or drink
Once there, the great sage Asita told the young priest
“Naradatta, when you hear that a buddha has appeared in this world
When they heard that sweet speech
you must go immediately to see him and take ordination with that teacher
They bowed down to the Victorious One and circumambulated him
Pleased, they decided with their companions To feed the Victorious One
This will have a long-lasting purpose and bring you benefit and happiness.
On this topic, it is said
Seeing the hosts of gods, suspended in space calling out, “Buddha!
The divine sage Asita, who lived on the mountain slopes, was filled with joy
“What is this word Buddha, which brings such joy to all beings
It fills my body with pleasure, my mind with joy, and brings supreme peace
“Is he a god, a demigod, a garuḍa, a kiṃnara, this Buddha? That word, which I never heard before, brings joy and trust.
He looked with divine vision over the ten directions, mountains, earth, and oceans
And looking again saw many amazing sights on the earth, mountains, and oceans
Once he had eaten, he tossed the bowl far into the sky
A divine king called Subrahman Retrieved the supreme jewel bowl, And is still now performing worship with it In the Brahma realm, together with his companions
“This beautiful light glows brilliantly, bringing physical bliss
On that occasion, the Thus-Gone One delighted the merchants Trapuṣa and Bhallika tremendously with these verses
As coral shoots spring forth on the mountaintops
Out of compassion for the two brothers
The trees burst into blossom and are laden with fruits— It is clear that a sublime jewel will soon appear in the three realms
And because he was aware of their previous intent to set out toward awakening
The Teacher accepted and ate the food
We beg that you eat this well-prepared meal!
“Venerable One, please accept and receive us
Carrying honey and the jewel bowl
They approached the trunk of the fig tree and said to the teacher
“The earth appears even and stainless like the palm of a hand
Collected the cream from the top, And respectfully prepared a meal
They combined without exception All the milk of one thousand cows
The gods joyfully wave banners in midair
Marvelous gems float in the abode of the ocean’s nāga king— Certainly a victorious jewel, a source of the doctrine, will appear in Jambūdvīpa
This is due to the meritorious actions Of this great sage.
Once Śikhaṇḍī had inspired the merchants, He returned to his own abode. Trapuṣa and the others Were all elated
“The lower realms are pacified, suffering removed, and beings find joy
“That your cows yielded clarified butter Is very auspicious, and occurred under an auspicious constellation
Hosts of devas move about the sky with delight As the pleasing and melodious songs of the gods resound
The Thus-Gone One who reached awakening Should be offered this food
Once he has eaten, he will turn the wheel of Dharma
These are certainly signs that here in the three realms, a jewel will appear.
Were I to teach it, no one would understand
“In the past you made the aspiration
He spoke the following verses to the merchants
Here in Jambūdvīpa, the sage Asita looked with the divine eye To the city of Kapilavastu, King Śuddhodana’s sublime city
So I will silently remain in the forest
Amazed, he went quickly with his disciple And arrived at the gate of Kapilavastu, the king’s supreme city
Thus I will remain silent and keep this truth in my heart.
Where he saw many trillions of living beings thronging
“Like a garland around your neck
May there be glory at your right hand
May there be glory at your left hand
And may there be glory surrounding you
At that time he uttered these verses
“May the merchants who pursue wealth And travel throughout the ten directions Attain great profit, And may that bring them happiness
He asked the gatekeeper to quickly say that a sage was at the gate
The gatekeeper hurriedly entered the palace and told the king
“Your Majesty, there is an old sage, a great ascetic, at the palace gates
That supreme sage asks to enter the king’s palace
Completely free of discursive, conceptual movement
Great King, shall I let him in or not? Please let me know.
The king made a seat for the sage and said, “Go and bring him here.
When the sage Asita heard the doorman’s words, he was happy and joyful
Like a thirsty man wishes for cool water, or one tormented by hunger hopes for food
The sublime sage was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing this excellent being
He joyously exclaimed, “King, may you be victorious and live long!
“I have discovered the supremely sublime and astonishing absolute
With these pleasing words and with calm mind and senses, he took his seat
The king respectfully addressed the sage with these words
“Please tell me, sage, why have you come to the royal palace?
“A son was born to you, supreme, transcendent, and splendorous, Ornamented by thirty-two excellent signs, and with the power of Nārāyaṇa
Your Majesty, I would be delighted to see your son, Sarvārthasiddha
That is why I have come here, O King. I have no other wish.
“Should you, for some reason, Need to travel east
“Excellent, you are welcome. Tired or not, I am delighted to see you
And may you return with great profit
The Boon-Granting Prince is sleeping, so this is not the time to see him
May you not incur evil! May all deities protect you
“May the quarters be safe for you
Wait a while and you will see the Perfect One, Who is like a stainless full moon adorned with a crown of stars.
May it too especially protect you With health and well-being
When the Supreme Guide awoke, glowing like the full moon, The king took that blazing being, whose light outshone the sun, onto his lap
The sage Asita saw his beautiful feet, ornamented by the mark of wheels
unobserved
It is the abode of all yakṣas and bhūtas
Has many peaks, and is pleasant to behold
May it too protect you with health and well-being
“May the quarters be safe for you
May you not incur evil
May all deities protect you
And may you return wealthy
“The twenty-eight constellations
Seven dwelling in each of the four directions
The thirty-two goddesses
Eight dwelling in each of the four directions
“The eight renunciates, the eight priests
The eight towns throughout the lands
And the eight gods, together with their Śakras
May they all protect you
“May you have good fortune going
May you have good fortune returning
May you have the good fortune of beholding your kinfolk
May you have the good fortune of being beheld by your kinfolk
“Lovingly cared for by numerous yakṣas with their Śakras And by the worthy ones
May you travel happily everywhere And obtain the auspicious nectar
You must immediately take ordination and follow the Able One, and then you shall attain nirvāṇa.
When this prince awakens as a buddha and turns the wheel of Dharma
The sage was delighted and spoke to his nephew, “Listen to my instructions
“Supreme Leader of All Beings in the Three Realms, I prostrate to you!
“Powerful One, the gods worship you, the sages praise you
He stood up, joined his palms, and prostrated at the prince’s feet
Hearing the sage’s prophecy, the king was delighted and overjoyed
“Yet, since he will not desire sense pleasures, he will certainly become a buddha.
Either he will be a universal monarch, or he will be a buddha, supreme on this earth
May they especially protect you With health and well-being! “In a section of the west, there is a mountain called Aṣṭaṃga; The sun and the moon also reside there
Thus he has only one of two destinies, and no third choice
May that mountain give you wealth And protect you with health and well-being
Your Majesty, his stainless body is marked by thirty-two excellent signs
“May the quarters be safe for you! May you not incur evil! May you be protected by all deities, And may you return wealthy
They went for refuge in the Buddha and the Dharma
“And because I will not see this delightful sight, I cry
Renowned worldly protectors, Reside in the north
When they heard the Victorious One’s prophecy
The two brothers were elated and supremely pleased. Together with their companions
This prince will be a buddha, revered by the world, who will teach the genuine doctrine
The infinitely many bodhisattvas that were prophesied later Cannot possibly turn back from awakening
I myself am old and infirm, and thus I grieve for myself
“There is no misfortune or obstacle for your son, Sarvārthasiddha
“O Sage, why do you weep? Tell me the truth, what good or evil do you see?
Does the sage Asita see some obstacle for my Sarvārthasiddha
This was the first prophecy made  By the Victorious One, the Guide of the World
The supreme king became afraid and asked, “Why does the priest weep
“Through this virtuous deed, You will become victorious ones known as Madhusaṃbhava!
Then lauded their offerings as fortuitous, saying
Terribly sad in body and mind, the sage shed tears and sighed deeply
The child would be a powerful universal monarch or a buddha, supreme in the world
The Peerless Guide, Lord of the World
Skilled in the Vedas and commentaries, the sage shook his head as he saw two possibilities
May your lives be preserved for one hundred autumns!
He saw the child with the strength of Nārāyaṇa, ornamented by supreme marks
The learned sage held the child and gazed upon him, deep in thought
Especially protect you With health and well-being! “In a section of the north, There are eight goddesses
“You have very good fortune to have a son like this
He will satisfy the world, with its gods and humans, through the doctrine.
The great sage then left Kapilavastu and returned to his hermitage
May they always protect you! “Their lord and king Is Kubera, borne by men. May this lord of all yakṣas, Together with Maṇibhadra, protect you! “May his many sons, wise and mighty, All ninety-one of whom are called Indra
He will soon awaken to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood
“In a section of the west, There are eight goddesses
Born into the family of King Ikṣvāku, he has come to the world of humans
“May his many sons, wise and mighty, All ninety-one of whom are called Indra, Especially protect you With health and well-being
Since he has his mind set on deliverance, he will uproot birth, old age, and death. He is wellborn and will bring beings to awakening
He uproots the strength of the demons
He bears the crowning banner of great wisdom
May they protect you With health and well-being
He conquers the enemy’s army and has a joyful and excellent mind without stains
“He is adorned with the marks of a hundred merits and is full of a determined resolve
He has appeared out of the roots of virtue that were brought about by previous buddhas
the Sāmkhya philosophical system, the Yoga philosophical system, ceremonies, the art of courtesans, the Vaiśeṣika philosophical system, economics, ethics, hydraulics
He strives for the benefit of all beings and is shielded by the armor of diligence
ritual science and its related lexicon, revealed scripture, ancient stories, history, the Vedas, grammar, etymologies, phonetics, metrics and composition, rules for conducting rituals
During the sixth week, the Thus-Gone One proceeded from the nāga king Mucilinda’s domain to a banyan tree of a goat herder
They had two bullocks called Sujāta and Kīrti
These two bulls had no fear of being waylaid, and thus they could be employed where no other bullocks would pass
Wherever there was a threat, they would stand as though fastened to stakes
Monks, as soon as the Bodhisattva was born, the god Maheśvara called out to the gods of the pure abodes
coiled his body around that of the Thus-Gone One seven times, and shielded him with his hoods
there were numerous gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, as well as  Śakra and Brahmā and the guardians of the world, who were eager to make offerings to the Bodhisattva. They arrived calling out in joyous voices
they too coiled their bodies seven times around the body of the Thus-Gone One and shielded him with their hoods
From the east as well, several more nāga kings arrived. Worried that the cold and wind would harm the Blessed One’s body
“Friends, there is a bodhisattva, a great being, who has excellently and diligently practiced purification, generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, knowledge, methods, studies, conduct, ascetic practices, and austerities for countless trillions of eons
Once he has left home, will we see him sitting under the great king of trees
The other gods who are overcome by their pride will see us paying homage to the Bodhisattva, and they will cast aside their pride, haughtiness, and arrogance
They will also go to pay homage, service, and respect to the Bodhisattva
This will bring lasting purpose, benefit, and happiness to those gods, until they attain immortality
The might and prosperity of King Śuddhodana will become renowned
Let us make a true prophecy about the Bodhisattva, and then return.
After the god Maheśvara had said this
I will establish them in peace and happiness without disease.’ Saying this, you have always trained in forbearance
Deliver beings from the ocean of existence, And establish them in peace and happiness without disease.
The gatekeeper informed the king of their arrival
and Maheśvara entered the palace with the king’s permission
He prostrated, touching his head to the Bodhisattva’s feet
drew his robe over one shoulder, and circled the Bodhisattva many hundreds of thousands of times. He then took the Bodhisattva onto his lap and spoke these joyful words to King Śuddhodana
“Great King, you should be supremely delighted
The reason
“ ‘I will give beings who are veiled by the darkness of delusion and ignorance A vision of many hundred doors to the Dharma
The four rivers carry beings away
Quick, rescue those beings that have no guide, Through the power of your diligence and the strength of your discipline
Great King, is that the Bodhisattva’s body is beautifully ornamented with the major and minor marks of a great being, and he outshines the world of gods, humans, and demigods with his color, magnificence, renown, and glory
Great King, it is therefore certain that the Bodhisattva will awaken to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood.
“ ‘I will establish on the noble path Those beings that have confused faculties and suffer from monkey-like thoughts.
O Gentle One, to accomplish that, You have trained in concentration that expels disturbing emotions
I will give them eyes that can see reality.’ Saying this, you have meditated on knowledge
“Remember your previous actions! To those beings who are veiled by the darkness of delusion and ignorance
You must give the excellent light of sacred knowledge
Monks, in this way the god Maheśvara, together with the many gods of the pure realms, made offerings to the Bodhisattva and showed him great respect
The eye of Dharma, which is stainless and impeccable.
He could not avoid thinking about the Dharma
Monks, this was because for so long the Bodhisattva had paid his respects to the Dharma and to those who teach the Dharma
From the innermost core of his being, he strove toward the Dharma, wished for the Dharma, and his only delight was in the Dharma
On this topic, it is said
Learning of the birth of He Who Has Crossed the Ocean of Qualities, Maheśvara, overjoyed, spoke to the gods
“For many millions of eons, it is so rare even to hear of this
So come, let us go and worship the Lord of Men.
“Here I reached the end of all crying, Wailing, anguish, and lamentation, Once I attained The absorption and qualities born of wisdom
Thus all the twelve thousand pure gods, beautifully ornamented with jeweled crowns, Excellently comported, and with their lovely hair flowing, Quickly traveled to the supreme city of Kapilavastu And stood before the king’s gate
They spoke politely to the gatekeeper
“Go to the palace and make our arrival known to the king.
“Here I triumphed over all the streams of tormenting anguish, With their tributaries and bends Of conceit and negligence, Once I attained the absorption in harmony with truth
The gatekeeper went inside as they asked
Joined his palms, and spoke to the king
“Your Majesty, may you always be victorious and live long
Pure luminescent beings with great merit stand by your door
Also swans, peacocks, parrots, cuckoos, and wild ducks Call out at the time of dawn
Beautifully ornamented with jeweled crowns and excellent conduct. Their faces are like the full moon; their luster is pure like that of the clear moon
“King, wherever they go, they cast no shadow
When they walk, their steps make no sound
When they step on the earth, they raise no dust
And beings never tire of gazing upon them
“Their bodies radiate great clear light
Their words are beautiful; those of humans cannot compare
Their speech is profound, soft, and melodious
These are not humans; I think they must be gods
He sits on a lion throne on the central mountain
“They wait respectfully, each of them holding in his hands The choicest flowers, garlands, unguents, and silk
The king, hearing these words, was delighted and said
“Go invite them all into the palace
The qualities and behavior you have described
Such miracles are not made by humans.
The gatekeeper joined his palms and spoke to the gods
“The king invites you all to come inside.
The gods with garlands in their arms were overjoyed And entered the king’s palace, which was similar to the god realm
“Here I destroyed manifold forms of pride And arrogance too, so that they exist no more
Seeing these supreme gods enter his palace
The king rose from his seat and joined his palms
“It would not be right if I did not share my plans with the great king Śuddhodana and simply left home without his permission
“These thrones with jeweled legs have been arranged here
Please, with your great benevolence, kindly take your seats.
Then, without pride or haughtiness, the gods took their seats
“King, please listen to our reason for coming here
As soon as the Bodhisattva stepped foot on the palace floor, the entire palace became illuminated with light
A child, whose body is pure and who has great merits, has been born to you
The king woke up and, when he saw the light, he promptly asked his chamberlain, “Did the sun rise
We wish to see his honored person
It is such a beautiful light!
“The trichiliocosm has become as indestructible and firm as a vajra
His chamberlain replied
“We know the significance of excellent marks; We know what they mean, their course and their application
“No, my lord, it is still the middle of the night.
He continued: “My lord, the light of the sun causes trees and walls to cast shadows
It torments and overheats the body
Thus, sublime king, do not feel sad; We wish to see the one who has these many marks
He becomes a doctor and dispenses many medicines, Curing billions of beings of their many diseases
The king, surrounded by the women of the palace, was filled with joy
strewed it with flowers, covered it with canopies of various dyed fabrics, and then offered it to the Thus-Gone One. Thereafter they praised him with these verses
He further sees many beings struck with illness; Their health and splendor is gone, and their strength is weak
And he took the prince, blazing like a fire, on his lap
The supreme gods, with flowing hair, approached; Just when they emerged from the door, the whole trichiliocosm trembled
When the supreme gods saw the Leader’s feet and nails, Copper colored, stainless, pure, and majestic
‘Even should my skin, flesh, bones, and marrow shrivel up right here
Those gods with their flowing hair quickly stood and prostrated
In his dream he further sees rivers overflowing And many billions of beings swept away
Placing their heads at the feet of the one with stainless brilliance
Building a boat he frees himself and can save others; He takes them to the best of shores, the one that is free from fear and suffering
I will not rise from this place without reaching awakening.
He climbs an abhorrent and revolting mountain of excrement, Yet he succeeds and remains free from stains
Because of these marks and the glory that they show, As well as the splendor of merit and the unseen crown of his head
You sat on the seat of awakening by virtue of your vajra-hard position when you said
They pay homage to you, Supreme Biped
But you are neither proud nor overwhelmed.
And also because of the light that shines from the tuft of hair on his forehead
Next the four great kings, together with the gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, went to the place where the Thus-Gone One was
When they arrived, they paid homage to him. Hundreds of thousands of gods surrounded him, holding garlands and bouquets of abhimuktaka flowers, campaka flowers, jasmine flowers, nutmeg blossoms, and dhānuṣkāri flowers. Hundreds of thousands of celestial maidens surrounded him, singing divine songs
Thereafter they all praised the Thus-Gone One with these fitting verse
Seeing the sage crying, shedding tears and sobbing, the king became afraid and distressed, and he very quickly inquired of the great sage
Resounds throughout all the worlds
As the sage saw this, tears streamed down his face and he sat there sobbing
It surpasses the voice of all who can speak
“When your melodious speech
It is certain that he will conquer Māra and find awakening
A voice so sweet and beloved among gods and humans
“It quells the afflictions of attachment, anger, and delusion
It engenders pristine joy within nonhumans
The gods praised the prince, saying, “He is free from the darkness of disturbing emotions; He is full of qualities and is able to see things, just as they are
This jewel among men has finally appeared— The one who has conquered the enemies of birth, old age, death, and disturbing emotions
We pay homage with our heads bowed! “We witness at the seat of awakening The magnificent displays performed by the gods
“Stirred by objects of desire and imagination, three fires are born, Setting the three existences ablaze and causing deep torment
“In your intelligence, you hold wisdom instructions to be supreme and convey them throughout the three existences
Yet you, a heroic cloud of Dharma, will aid the tormented by filling the trichiliocosm With a rain of the nectar of immortality to calm the suffering of negative emotions
To you, Sage of the Śākyas, bull among men, honored by gods and humans, we pay homage
“With a loving voice and soft, compassionate speech
A teacher who can instruct the audiences of gods and humans in need of instruction
You will call out with the delightful strains of Brahmā’s voice
Whose mind is gentle, composed, with subdued sense faculties, and great calmness
“Consummate Guide, whose melodious speech relates what is true and untrue
Heard in all three realms and by all beings
To you whose extraordinary wisdom has directly manifested, we bow down
Blessed One, quickly call out with the great speech of a buddha
“You will conquer the evil hordes of extremists with mistaken views, Who are caught up in worldly desire and who remain on the peak of existence
With your brilliance and illuminating insight, you are replete with radiance and glory
Hearing your doctrine of emptiness and interdependent causality
They will scatter like jackals before a lion
The luster of Śakra and Brahmā—none of it shines in the presence of your splendor
“You clear away the obscuration of ignorance, the haze of the great disturbing emotions; You appear and manifest for the sake of beings
You, the shining light of wisdom, the light rays of insight, May you dispel the great darkness of all beings with your gaze
“Sunlight, moonlight, stars, firelight, and the luster of jewels
For this reason, you are the sublime physician and guide who courses upon the earth
“When such an amazing pure being as this appears, Gods and humans acquire a tremendous boon
the result is never-ending Until the attainment of supreme awakening
“Under the sway of carelessness and overcome by delusion, I was blind in the past, covered with a veil of wrong views. Such views made me grasp at the notion of a self And perpetuate the experience of sensations, all due to not knowing the Dharma
This precious being, who grants awakening
Will cut the path to the lower realms and open the paths of the gods!
The gods strewed a rain of divine flowers over Kapilavastu
When a donation is given to him
Before departing joyfully up through the sky
This concludes the seventh chapter, on the birth
All of them were offered to the Bodhisattva by their parents to serve and honor him
King Śuddhodana also gave twenty thousand girls to the Bodhisattva to serve and honor him
His friends, his ministers, his  kinfolk, and his blood relatives also offered twenty thousand girls to serve and honor the Bodhisattva
Finally the members of ministerial assemblies also offered twenty thousand girls to serve and honor the Bodhisattva
He is a sublime object of veneration
“He yields the fruit of immortality
Monks, at that time the male and female elders of the Śākya clan gathered and said to King Śuddhodana
“King, please pay heed
Is worthy of reverence throughout the three worlds As a field for those seeking merit
“It is my resolve to board that ship and cross the ocean of cyclic existence. Then I will ferry innumerable beings across this ocean, This sea of suffering so hard to cross with its waves of anger, Monsters of passion, and maelstroms of enmity
The prince should now worship in the temple.
King Śuddhodana replied
“Yes, it would be excellent for him to worship in this way. Therefore, let the city be decorated
Ornament the streets, crossroads, intersections, and marketplaces
So why do you give me the order for leaving?” The Bodhisattva replied
Ornament the gates of this excellent city
“The time for what, my Lord?” The Bodhisattva replied
“This god of gods
Revered even by the gods
He has also triumphed over the demon of the gods— Thus he has no anguish
And likewise over the lord of death and the demon of afflictions
“He has triumphed over the demon of the aggregate
He has benefited tens of millions of sentient beings And thus swiftly attained awakening
“Through his insight, learning, and accumulations, Developed over the course of tens of millions of eons
Play the most pleasant instruments, cymbals, and drums
Assemble all the local lords and gather the merchants, householders, ministers, gatekeepers, and all the local people
Through the merit of praising you, may we become like you, the lion of speech.
Prepare chariots for the girls
Procure brimming vases
Gather the priests who are experts in recitation
Ornately decorate the temples.
Monks, everyone followed the commands issued by the king
Then King Śuddhodana went to his home and spoke to Mahāprajāpati Gautamī, saying
“The prince is to pray in the temple. Ornament him well.
He revered the best of sages And is therefore honored now himself
Mahāprajāpati Gautamī replied, “Of course,” and dressed the prince lavishly
While the prince was being dressed, with a slight smile and no hint of annoyance, he spoke these pleasant words to his maternal aunt
“Mother, where are you taking me?” She replied
In the form of a supreme being, he is praised in infinite ways
“Son, I am taking you to the temple.
“Through his concentration, higher knowledge, and wisdom Enacted over many tens of millions of eons
He drove away his opponents And thus triumphed over Māra’s army
The prince then smiled, laughed, and spoke these verses to his maternal aunt
“Through the strength and intensity of his valor Over many tens of millions of eons
“Free from the darkness of ignorance, he destroys old age, death, and the afflictions; He will become the self-arisen victor, famous on earth and in heaven
He embraced suffering And therefore shines like gold
“Through wearing the strong armor of forbearance For many tens of millions of eons
Friends, Prince Siddhārtha has become a monk
He outshines Śakra and Brahmā
“When I was born, this trichiliocosm trembled
“Through practicing discipline, vows, and austerities For many tens of millions of eons While seeking awakening
Śakra, Brahmā, the demigods, the mahoragas,  Sūrya, and Candra, as well as Vaiśravaṇa and Kumāra, All bowed their heads to my feet and paid homage to me
the afflictions were rattled
the splinter was removed
the knot was untied
they began to search for him in the spring, summer, and winter palaces, and in his private rooms and apartments. Unable to find him, they all began to wail like fish hawks
“What other god is there who is superior to me, Who my mother takes me to worship today
the flag of pride was brought down
the flag of righteousness was lifted
latent formations were uprooted
I am superior to all the gods; I am the God of Gods
the suchness of phenomena became known
the absolute was comprehended
the realm of phenomena was understood
“In all the parks, the leaves, flowers, and fruits are gone
There is no other god like me, so how could anyone be superior
the nature of sentient beings was ascertained
those oriented toward reality were approved of
those oriented toward mistakenness were disapproved of
“Still, mother, I will follow worldly customs; When beings see my miraculous displays, they will be pleased. It will inspire them with great respect
And gods and humans will know that I am the God of Gods.
Monks, when the Thus-Gone One reached complete awakening in this manner
These words of amazement, delight, and joy resounded all the way up to the Highest Heaven
He will establish them in the realm of phenomena, which is blissful, peaceful, deathless, and free from fear, suffering,  harm, and stain.
The brilliant white necklaces of pearl have faded and collected dust
All the worlds were flooded with bright light, including even the dark spaces between them that were riddled with evil
“It may indeed be that this boy is superior in knowledge of scripts, but he should also be tested and distinguish himself in knowledge of mathematics.
Monks, indeed, the very moment that the Bodhisattva attained omniscience, all beings throughout all the worlds in the ten directions instantly became ecstatic
Monks, the Thus-Gone One abided on the seat of awakening for the first seven days, reflecting, “Here I have brought an end to the suffering of birth, old age, and death, which has been happening since time immemorial.
So the greatest mathematician among the Śākyas, a man called Arjuna, an adept in knowledge of calculation, was appointed judge and told
“You are to determine who among the boys here is superior in knowledge of numbers.
First the Bodhisattva proposed a mathematical problem
One of the Śākya boys tried to calculate it, but he could not solve it
Next another Śākya boy, then two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred—up to five hundred of them—together tried to calculate the problem, but they could not solve it
Next the Bodhisattva said
“Now you propose a mathematical problem, and I will calculate it.
Monks, then the gods said
One of the Śākya boys proposed a mathematical problem to the Bodhisattva, but the boy could not confound the Bodhisattva’s calculations
Next two of the Śākya boys, then three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fift
up to five hundred of them—together proposed a mathematical problem, but they could not confound the Bodhisattva’s calculations
Finally the Bodhisattva said
“Enough with this dispute
All of you should convene and propose a mathematical problem for me
Then I will calculate it.
Accordingly five hundred Śākya boy
in unison proposed an unprecedented problem, and still the Bodhisattva calculated it without any consternation
In this way all the Śākya boys met their match while the Bodhisattva remained undefeated
Impurities have been extinguished
The outflows have dried up and flow no longer
The path, now ended, I travel no longer
The gods thus strewed the Thus-Gone One with celestial flowers
“What must be absent to avoid everything down to formations to manifest
Monks, once the main streets, crossroads, intersections, and markets had been richly ornamented, with praises and benedictions of all kinds posted around the city, a richly ornamented chariot was prepared for the prince in the inner courtyard. With all auspicious circumstances having been arranged in this manner, King Śuddhodana lifted the prince onto his lap
What must be prevented to eliminate formations?
Preventing ignorance prevents formations
At that time a hundred thousand gods led the Bodhisattva’s chariot
By preventing formations, consciousness is prevented
Many hundreds of millions of gods and maidens scattered flowers from the sky above and played cymbals
and so on, until birth is prevented, thus putting an end to old age and death, anguish, lamentation, pain, despair, and torment
Birth is eliminated by preventing existence.” The Bodhisattva then considered
It then occurred to him, “When there is no ignorance, formations do not form
The thought then occurred to him, “When there is no existence, birth does not take place
the defilement of ignorance
and the defilement of beliefs
and where exactly these defilements vanish and disappear without leaving any residue
Monks, King Śuddhodana, accompanied by the great royal procession, splendor, and ceremony, brought the prince to the temple
As soon as the Bodhisattva placed his right foot in the temple
From the sky, gods called out these verses
Then, while his mind—purified and cleansed, lucid, free of basic and subsidiary afflictions, supple, flexible, and immovable—was immersed in this way
Right then a hundred thousand gods and humans cried out in amazement and delight
an eon of both destruction and formation
the insentient  statues of the gods, such as Śiva, Skanda, Nārāyaṇa, Kubera, Candra, Sūrya, Vaiśravaṇa, Śakra, Brahmā, and the guardians of the world, all stood up from their seats and prostrated at the Bodhisattva’s feet
First those Śākya boys who were skilled in the rules of writing competed with the Bodhisattva in the art of scripts
The fine city of Kapilavastu trembled in six ways
A rain of divine flowers fell
and a hundred thousand divine instruments sounded without even being played
Then the various statues in the temple all returned to their seats and spoke these verses
The great ocean, the nāga king’s abode, would never bow down to a puddle
this lifespan, stayed for this duration, and experienced these kinds of pleasure and pain
“Mount Meru, the greatest and best of mountains, would never bow down to a mustard seed
After falling from there, I was born here. After falling from there, I was born here…
The teacher Viśmāmitra was appointed judge by the Śākyas, and he announced, “You are to determine who among these  boys is superior, whether in penmanship or in the knowledge of scripts.
The brilliant sun and moon would never bow down before a firefly
Then, because the teacher Viśmāmitra had witnessed firsthand the Bodhisattva’s knowledge of scripts, he smiled and said these verses
So how could the Noble One, with merit and wisdom, bow down before the gods
“In that place I had this name, this surname, this family, this caste, this diet
“This pure being has reached perfection In all the scripts, as many as there are in all the worlds, Whether it be the world of humans, the world of gods, The world of demigods, or the world of gandharvas
Then hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of cries of amazement and waved their banners
“The gods and humans of this trichiliocosm Are like mustard seeds, puddles, and fireflies, and yet filled with pride
Today this is aptly called Elephant Gorge
A deep pit formed where the elephant landed
a quadrillion lifetimes, then several billion, several tens of billions, several trillions, and several quadrillions of lifetimes
all the way up to the lifetimes in an eon of destruction, an eon of formation
Then, while still on his chariot, the prince extended one foot to the ground, and with his big toe he took hold of the elephant and hurled it a mile outside the city, over seven walls and seven moats
If the world bows to He Who Is like Mount Meru, the Ocean, the Sun, and the Moon— The self-arisen sublime one of this world—then they would attain heaven and nirvāṇa.
King Śuddhodana, the Śākya elders, and a big crowd also arrived there, eager to compare the differences in artistic skill between the Bodhisattva and the other Śākya boys
when the Bodhisattva entered the temple
three million two hundred thousand gods gave rise to the intention to attain unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening
The great mathematician Arjuna was amazed and said these verses
“When this fine intellect was questioned
Monks, these are the circumstances and causes related to the Bodhisattva’s equanimity as he was brought to the temple
His knowledge was so very quick That all five hundred Śākya boys Were surpassed on the path of calculation
He thus settled into the third meditative concentration, which is unconnected with joy
“With such insight, wisdom, Intellect, and mindfulness, This ocean of knowledge Even today learns and trains further in calculation.
The noble ones call such a person  the impartial one dwelling on pleasure that is imbued with mindfulness
The whole Śākya assembly was shocked and amazed, and they all said in unison
“O Prince Sarvārthasiddha, you have won, you have won!
Through disenchantment with joy, he remained impartial, maintained mindfulness and introspection, and experienced physical pleasure
All of them stood up from their seats, and with palms joined paid homage to the Bodhisattva. Then they addressed King Śuddhodana
The king replied, “Very well, then do it.
At that time King Śuddhodana had five hundred types of ornaments made by five hundred Śākyas
“Great King, you are so fortunate to have a son whose eloquent self-confidence is so swift, nimble, subtle, and potent in the face of questions.
King Śuddhodana then said to the Bodhisattva
“Son, can you match the ways of calculation with the great mathematician Arjuna, an expert in the knowledge of numbers?
The great mathematician Arjuna then asked the Bodhisattva
The Bodhisattva replied
“One hundred times ten million is called a billion (ayuta)
One hundred times one billion is called one hundred billion (niyuta)
One hundred times one hundred billion is called one quadrillion (kañkara)
One hundred quadrillions is called one sextillion (vivara)
“King, please ornament the prince.
One hundred sextillions is called a nonillion (akṣobhya)
One hundred nonillions is called  a vivāha
One hundred vivāhas is called an utsañga
One hundred utsañgas is called a bahula
One hundred bahulas is called a nāgabala
One hundred nāgabalas is called a tiṭilambha
At dawn, as the sun rose, the Bodhisattva entered the park known as Stainless Array
“How then,” asked Arjuna, “should one commence that calculation?
where Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī took him onto her lap
Eighty thousand women welcomed the Bodhisattva and gazed at his countenance
“Child, do you know how to calculate the number called ten million to the hundredth power?” “Yes, I do,” said the Bodhisattva
They fled like birds seeing a forest fire
“I can, Your Majesty,” responded the Bodhisattva. “Then calculate away!” commanded the king
Five thousand priests also arrived and  gazed at the Bodhisattva’s countenance
One hundred tiṭilambhas is called a vyavasthāna­prajñapti
One hundred vyavasthāna­prajñaptis is called a hetuhila
Then the ornaments that had been commissioned by the gracious king of the Śākyas were fastened onto the Bodhisattva’s body
One hundred hetuhilas is called a karaphū
One hundred karaphūs is called a hetvindriya
One hundred hetvindriyas is called a samāptalambha
One hundred samāptalambhas is called a gaṇanāgati
One hundred gaṇanāgatis is called a niravadya
One hundred niravadyas is called a mudrābala
One hundred mudrābalas is called a sarvabala
As soon as the ornaments were placed on the Bodhisattva’s body, the radiance of his body eclipsed their luster
One hundred sarvabalas is called a visaṃjñāgati
One hundred visaṃjñāgatis is called a sarvasaṃjña
One hundred sarvasaṃjñas is called a vibhūtaṃgamā
One hundred vibhūtaṃgamās is called a tallakṣaṇa
Frightened and disheartened, they all fled
They did not glitter or gleam, and they lost all their shine
“If one uses tallakṣaṇa as the basic unit of calculation, it is feasible to calculate the size of Mount Meru, the king of mountains
Beyond that is the number called dhvajāgravatī
They were just like a lump of coal that is placed next to gold from the Jambū River—it also does not glitter, gleam, or shine
In the same way, when the ornaments were struck by the light radiating from the Bodhisattva’s body, they lost all their glitter, gleam, and shine
And thus it was that any ornament that was placed on the Bodhisattva’s body lost its luster
Yet none of them can be found in his body, nor in his mind
like a lump of soot thrown before gold from the Jambū River
If one uses dhvajāgravatī as the basic unit of calculation, it is possible to solve the calculation for all the grains of sand in the river Ganges
Beyond that is the number called dhvajāgra­niśā­maṇī
Just as mud and dust cannot be found in the heavens
Next is the number called vāhanaprajñapti
Then the goddess of the pleasure grove, Vimala, revealed her vast body before the king and the group of Śākyas, and spoke these verses to them
“His body, speech, and mind are pristine
Then comes the number called iṅgā
And he is filled with love for sentient beings
“Even if the entire trichiliocosm with its cities and towns Were filled with stainless and beautiful gold
Beyond that is the number called kuruṭu
Then comes the number called kuruṭāvi
Then comes the number called sarvanikṣepā
With this count serving as the basic unit of calculation, it is possible to calculate the number of grains of sand in ten Ganges rivers
A single coin of gold from the Jambū River would steal its splendor, Leaving the other gold bereft of glory and brilliance
Beyond that is the number called agrasārā
With this figure as the basic unit of calculation, it is possible to solve the calculation equal to the number of grains of sand in one billion Ganges rivers
“Finally comes the number called application to the smallest particles (paramāṇu­rajaḥ­praveśānugata)
With the exception of a thus-gone one, a bodhisattva who dwells at the sublime seat of awakening
or a bodhisattva who is about to be initiated into all Dharmas, there is no other bein
It would not shine or gleam, but lose its beauty and glow
Before the Blissful Protector, it would appear just like soot
who understands this number, with the exception of me and perhaps one like me, namely a bodhisattva in his final existence who has departed from the household.
Then Arjuna asked
“Child, how would you enumerate the number application to the smallest particles?
Seven small particles is one water particle
Seven water particles is one airborne dust particle
“He is brimming with hundreds of qualities, adorned by his own magnificence
The Bodhisattva answered, “Seven of the smallest particles is one small particle
Not beautified by ornaments, his body is perfectly stainless
Seven airborne dust particles is one dust particle on a hare
Seven dust particles on a hare is one dust particle on a sheep
Seven dust particles on a sheep is one dust particle on a cow
The glows of the sun and moon, the stars, jewels, fire, Śakra, and Brahmā are no longer bright in front of his intense glory
Seven dust particles on a cow is one louse egg
Seven lice eggs is one mustard seed
Seven mustard seeds is one barley grain
Seven barley grains is one finger joint
“I could, with playful ease, Get hold of all the water in the four oceans
Twelve finger joints is one thumb tip to one index fingertip
Two measures of one thumb tip to one index fingertip is one cubit
“His body is adorned with signs, the result of previous virtue, So why would he need ordinary ornaments made by someone else
Four cubits is one bow
One thousand bows is considered one earshot in Magadha
Four times shouting-distance is one league
Who among you knows the total number of smallest particles in a league?” “Well,” said Arjuna
And it may be that the oceans dry up
“Chanda was born at the same time as the son of the kingdom
“I am uncertain about this. So, child, how much more so will the others, who are of weaker intellect, be confused
Child, please explain how many of the smallest particles make up a league.
Give these beautiful spotless jewels to him, the servant.
It is also possible that the sun and moon will fall from the sky
And it may be that the earth will one day melt away
Reflecting that the Śākya clan would flourish and become supreme
“Yet it is impossible that the one who has set out To benefit the world with a firm resolve Should rise from the foot of the great tree Before he attains awakening.
From the left side, Dīrgha­bāhu­garvita said
The Bodhisattva explained, “A league contains  billion nonillions,  quintillions,  billion,  million,  thousand smallest particles
“Right here before you, I could use my bare hands To grind to dust The sun, the moon, and the stars
Such is the sum of smallest particles in a league
“Moreover: It can happen that all mountains quake
There are seven thousand leagues here in Jambudvīpa, eight thousand leagues in the western continent of Godānīya, nine thousand leagues in the eastern continent of Videha, and ten thousand leagues in the northern continent of Kuru
“Moreover, there are one billion worlds of four continents, such as this world, and one billion oceans
There are also one billion surrounding mountain ranges and one billion outer ranges
Likewise there are one billion Mount Merus, the kings of mountains
When you shoot your weapons, they turn into flowers
“There are one billion god realms belonging to the four great kings
There are one billion Heavens of the Thirty-Three
one billion Heavens Free from Strife
one billion Heavens of Joy
one billion Heavens of Delighting in Emanations
Father, I will get hold of this monk And throw him to the end of the oceans
and one billion Heavens of Making Use of Others’ Emanations
“There are also one billion Brahma Realms
“Father, may this army stand firm! Do not be aggrieved
one billion realms of the High Priests of Brahmā
one billion realms of Brahmā’s Entourage
I will uproot the Bodhi tree And scatter it everywhere with my hands.
one billion realms of Great Brahmā
“Yet even thousands of beings like you
As many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges
Would be unable to move a single hair On that wise Bodhisattva.
From the left side, Bhayaṃkara said
one billion realms of Limited Light
one billion realms of Limitless Light
“Father, for one who is set in the midst of a great army, What is the use of excessive fear
one billion realms of the Luminous Heaven
one billion realms of the Heaven of Limited Virtue
one billion realms of the Heaven of Limitless Virtue
one billion realms of the Heaven of Perfected Virtue
ne billion realms of the Cloudless Heaven
one billion realms of the Heaven of Increased Merit
one billion realms of the Heaven of Great Fruition
one billion realms of the Heaven of Concept-Free Beings
one billion realms of the Unlofty Heaven
one billion realms of the Heaven of No Hardship
one billion realms of the Sublime Heaven
one billion realms of the Gorgeous Heaven
“In width and breadth, each world system contains leagues measuring in the hundreds, thousands, ten millions, billions, hundred billions, and so on, all the way up to the measure of an agrasārā
and one billion realms of the Gods of the Highest Heaven. All of this is called a great trichiliocosm
The Śākyas were delighted and amazed
They each kept just a single garment for themselves and offered the remaining garments and jewelry to the Bodhisattva
entire assembly of Śākyas were surprised and delighted, and they felt great appreciation and joy
When the Bodhisattva demonstrated this display of calculation, the great mathematician Arjuna and th
A number of smallest particles even more incalculable than that are those contained in a great trichiliocosm.
There is also a corresponding measure of the smallest particles. The number of these particles can indeed be calculated but, since it is unfathomable, it is called incalculable
Then the great mathematician Arjuna uttered the following verses
“One hundred times ten million is a billion
Likewise it is for one hundred billion and one quadrillion
This concludes the ninth chapter, on the ornaments
he was taken to school. He went there amid hundreds of thousands of auspicious signs, and he was surrounded and attended by tens of thousands of boys
along with ten thousand carts filled with hard food, soft food, and condiments, and ten thousand carts filled with gold coins and gems
These were distributed in the streets and road junctions, and the entrances to the markets of the city of Kapilavastu
At the same time a symphony of eight hundred thousand cymbals was sounded, and a heavy rain of flowers fell
Hundreds of thousands of girls, adorned with all kinds of jewelry, perched themselves on the balconies, turrets, arches, windows,  upper stories, and roofs of the homes
Gazing at the Bodhisattva, they tossed flowers
They sent rains with thunder, released bolts of lightning,  caused a rain of hot iron sands, gathered black clouds, and made storms arise
From the center of the sky, gods called out the following verse
“The Bodhisattva perfectly understands, with a single movement of his mind, All the primary and subsidiary mental states, conceptions, and opinions That belong to all beings throughout the three times without exception, Whether they be inferior or superior, narrow or broad.
In the sky above, gods sang these verses
“With the qualities of disciplined conduct and austerity And the strength of his forbearance, discipline, and love, developed over millions of eons
He is a leader with a body and mind that are supple in action
With such an array as this, the Bodhisattva was taken to school
And so you now witness the superiority of his swiftness
As soon as the Bodhisattva arrived in school
“You see this most excellent being here in this city
But instantaneously he is moving throughout the ten directions
Paying homage to infinite victorious ones, With a plethora of jewels and gold, in infinite worlds
“Yet you are totally unaware of his comings and goings; Such is the extent of his miraculous powers
So why should his skills here provoke wonder
He is without equal, and you should feel respect for him.
With his performances, the Bodhisattva uniquely distinguished himself
The Śākyas then said
“The prince should also be tested in terms of his strength.
At that time the Bodhisattva stood to one side while the five hundred Śākya youths wrestled among themselves
Then thirty-two Śākya youths stayed on to confront the Bodhisattva in wrestling
A god from the Heaven of Joy called Śubhāṅga saw the schoolmaster collapsed on the ground and
grabbing him with his right hand, raised him up
His stride was that of the single lord of the great trichiliocosm
the spontaneous stride that cannot be overpowered
the stride that actualizes the attainment of omniscient wisdom
Suspended in the sky, Śubhāṅga then spoke the following verses to King Śuddhodana and the crowd
“Whatever topics of knowledge are circulating in this world of humans— Numbers, scripts, mathematics, the permutations of the elements
the stride of mindfulness and insight
And all the immeasurable mundane techniques of craftsmanship— This child already learned these things many tens of millions of eons ago
the stride that leads to a happy rebirth
the stride that pacifies old age and death
At that point all the trees in this world of the great trichiliocosm bent their crowns toward the seat of awakening
All the children who had been born on that very day now slept with their heads toward the seat of awakening
Likewise all the mountains that exist in this world of the great trichiliocosm, such as Mount Meru, bowed toward the seat of awakening
All the way from the Nairañjanā River to the seat of awakening, the road had been beautified for a stretch of several miles by the gods of the desire realm
and the stride that proceeds from a stable and indestructible diamond-like intention
He had a stride that destroys all lower realms and all miserable existences, a stride that brings happiness to all beings
a stride that points out the path to liberation, a stride that renders powerless the strength of demons
“In seven days the prince will demonstrate his prowess in the arts
Thus everyone skilled in the arts is to assemble then!
a stride that suppresses evil opponents with their doctrines, a stride that removes the cataract of darkness and disturbing emotions
and a stride that undoes the workings of cyclic existence. He walked with a gait that outshines Śakra, Brahmā, Maheśvara, and the world protectors
the stride that proceeds from previous wholesome actions
the stride that walks upon stainless lotuses
“Nonetheless he acts solely in harmony with people
the stride that leads sentient beings to happy rebirths through contact with the light rays that emerge from the web between his fingers
He walked with the stride of someone whose feet level off the terrain, be it sloping up or sloping down
the stride that makes the earth resound, and the stride that crushes the king of the mountains
the stride of he whose fingers are connected through a web and who has copper-colored nails
the stride that leaves an impression of a thousand-spoked wheel on the ground
The Well-Instructed One thus came to school for the sake of instruction, In order to mature many children for the Highest Vehicle And to bring a myriad other beings to immortality
“He knows the way of the path of the transcendent four truths
He is adept in how things arise based on causes, And how the cessation and termination of conditioned existence leads to the calm state
When he knows all that, how could he not know the subject of scripts
the stride that floats above the surface
“There is no master superior to him throughout the three worlds
the stride of Nārāyaṇa
the stride of the king of elephants
the stride of the king of swans
It was the stride of a lion
and a stride free from attachment
Among all gods and humans, he alone is foremost
a stride free from anger, a stride free from delusion
All of you do not know even the names of the scripts That he has learned before, many tens of millions of eons ago
“This pure being knows in a single instant The manifold, diverse thoughts of beings
When he knows such invisible and formless things, Why mention the visible forms of scripts?
When he had spoken these verses, the god honored the Bodhisattva with celestial flowers and immediately thereafter disappeared
The nannies and the entourage of maids were asked to stay at the school, while the remaining Śākyas, headed by Śuddhodana, departed
The Bodhisattva took up a writing board made of sandalwood
It was decorated with flecks of divine gold of prime quality and studded with precious gems on all sides
He then addressed the master Viśvāmitra
O master, will you be teaching me
When seven days had passed, a group of Śākya boys five hundred strong assembled
Ahead of everyone else, the boy Devadatta arrived from the city
He saw that a large white elephant was being brought to the city for the Bodhisattva to ride
It was a graceful stride, a stainless stride, a beautiful stride
Intoxicated with jealousy, and drunk with pride about his Śākya family line as well as his own strength
he grabbed hold of the elephant by its trunk with his left hand and killed it with his right hand in a single stroke
Right then the boy Sundarananda arrived
Monks, when the Bodhisattva bathed in the Nairañjanā River and enjoyed a meal, his physical strength came back to him
Seeing that an elephant had been killed at the city gate, he asked, “Who killed it?
To Sujātā and the gods he offers a teaching that benefits them greatly
Grabbing hold of the elephant by the tail
With a triumphant gait, he now began the walk toward the great Bodhi tree. This tree was the king of trees and was found at a place characterized by sixteen unique features
he dragged it outside the city gate
Later the Bodhisattva arrived riding a chariot and noticed the dead elephant
the stride of the previous buddha-lions
When he inquired who had killed the animal, he was told that it was Devadatta. The Bodhisattva said, “That was not good of Devadatta
Who dragged the elephant outside the city gate?
“Gods and humans with little merit look for wisdom in mistaken ways
Being in a weakened state, they are unable to attain nectar-like awakening
Yet if I eat solid and excellent food, I will regain my physical strength
Then I can go to the king of trees to attain omniscient awakening under its branches.
The village girl Sujātā, who has done much good in the past, Continuously makes offerings, thinking, “May this guide complete his discipline!
Master, which of those sixty-four scripts will you teach me?
When she hears the request of the gods, she brings milk porridge with honey
She goes to the river and happily sits on the banks of the Nairañjanā
When it decays, the entire city will fill with a horrible stench.
For one thousand eons the Bodhisattva practiced discipline, and his faculties are at peace
The crowd told him, “It was Devadatta.” Sundarananda said, “That was not right of Devadatta.
He goes to the Nairañjanā surrounded by hosts of gods and nāgas as well as sages
He makes the crossing and bathes with thoughts aimed at liberating others
The Sage, pure and stainless, washes himself in the river out of love for the world
Trillions of gods joyfully descend into the river and infuse the waters With perfumes and scented powders so the Sacred Being can bathe
When the Stainless Bodhisattva has bathed and rests serene on the shore, Thousands of gods rejoice and take the bathing water as an object for venerating the Pure Being
A god offers him saffron robes of beautiful stainless cloth
Dressed in these suitable robes, the Blessed One rests on the banks of the river
A nāga girl joyfully and devotedly erects a splendid throne On which the guide of the universe peacefully sits
The schoolmaster Viśvāmitra was amazed, and he smiled
Sujātā fills a golden bowl with food and offers it to the Mindful One
She prostrates at his feet, saying joyfully, “Great Guide, please enjoy this!
The Mindful One eats as much as necessary and then throws the bowl in the river
Setting aside pride, conceit, and arrogance, he replied with the following verses
The highest god, the destroyer of cities, carries it off, saying, “I will venerate it!
The very moment the Victorious One consumes solid and excellent food
“May your daughter be given to my son!
His body regains its former strength, magnificence, and splendor
Daṇḍapāṇi replied
“The noble boy has grown up in the palace in ease and comfort
As soon as the bowl hit the water, the nāga king Sāgara, full of devotion and great respect, came to fetch the bowl and bring it to his kingdom, thinking, “This is worthy of veneration!
Yet our family rule is such that a girl can only be granted to someone who is skilled in the arts, and not to a man who lacks these skills
Then, sitting cross-legged and upright, the Bodhisattva practiced concentration, Immersed in the virtue of the four concentrations
The prince is not skilled in the arts since he does not know the maneuvers of swordsmanship, archery, combat, or wrestling
Gathered some grass, and spread out a seat for himself
How can I give away my daughter to someone who lacks such skills?
The Bodhisattva heard the story as well
He went to King Śuddhodana and asked
“Your Majesty, what’s wrong? Why are you sitting here so depressed?
But the king just responded
The Bodhisattva then asked
“O King, is there anyone in this city who can compete with me in the arts?
King Śuddhodana, with a smile on his face, asked the Bodhisattva in return
When King Śuddhodana heard this, he sent the councilor-priest before Daṇḍapāṇi Śākya with the request
The king was informed of this reply and thought
On this topic, it is said
The ministers thus told them, “Quiet down! Quiet down!” “Why?” asked the boys. The ministers responded
“Even though the orb of the sun has shifted, the shade of his tree does not leave Prince Siddhārtha—who has the highest and most sublime marks of virtue and is as brilliant as the sky—while he practices concentration, motionless as a mountain.
At that point some of the other boys, who were carrying their seats, made a commotion
“This makes two times that I have been opposed with such a commonsensical rule
When I said, ‘Why don’t the Śākya boys come to attend upon the boy?
I was told, ‘Why should we attend upon an indolent?’ And now this.” The king sat and reflected thus
“My son, are you capable of demonstrating any athletic prowess?” The prince responded, “I surely am,  Your Majesty
So please assemble everyone who is skilled in the arts
“If it’s gold that you seek, I will shower down a rain of gold
He will conquer the entire earth without the use of violence or weapons, and then he will rule  according to the Dharma
In that way the line of our universal monarchy will not be cut, and we will be irreproachably respected by all the kings of the realm.
A king receives veneration surrounded by a crowd of people
When a bodhisattva obtains a sizable entourage, He leads trillions of sentient beings to the deathless state
“The wise bodhisattvas who came before me
She should not be attracted to alcohol, tastes, sounds, or fragrances; She should be free of greed and covetousness, satisfied with her fortune
archery
fencing
“Adhering to truth, she should be steady and unwavering; Not puffed up, she should dress with modesty
Always engaging in righteousness, she should be unimpressed with flashy displays; She should always be pure in body, speech, and mind
Monks, due to the strength of the Bodhisattva’s merit and the power of his insight, his body instantaneously changed as soon as he took in solid foods. In one moment his body regained its previous beautiful lotus-like luster
calculations, astrology
“She should not be excessively slothful or indolent, nor full of foolish pride; Circumspect, she should always be engaged in good deeds
She should regard her in-laws with the affection reserved for teachers, And be as loving to the servants and maids as she is to herself
arithmetic
writing
crafts
After six years of austerities, the Blessed One thinks
such as his skills in arts
She should be without any pride or willfulness, like a servant
“I may have the strength of concentration and supernatural knowledge
But if I go to the king of trees in order to awaken to omniscience under its branches While I am this emaciated, that would not be kind toward beings in the future
The nāga girl carried off the magnificent throne in order to make a memorial out of it and venerate it
“Blessed One, there is an extensive collection of discourses on the Dharma that bears the name Lalitavistara (The Play in Full)
“She should be as adept as a courtesan in knowing the arts of love
To this day the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three hold an annual Festival of the Bowl
When he was done with his meal, he threw the golden bowl into the water without any feelings of attachment
and then stood to one side, supplicating him with the following words
They prostrated to the Blessed One, placing their heads at his feet
She then told one of her servants, a woman named Uttarā
“Uttarā, go and fetch the priest
I will stay here and look after this milk porridge with honey.
“Very well, my lady,” answered Uttarā, who then did as she was told
She went off in the eastern direction, but there she met only the Bodhisattva
She then went south, but there as well she met the Bodhisattva
Then she went west and north, but in those places as well she encountered the Bodhisattva
She should be the last to go to sleep and the first to rise; She should lovingly obey, and be as guileless as a mother
Find me, O father, a wife like this!
Maheśvara
Nanda, Sunanda
Candana
The Bodhisattva accepted these meals, but he also gradually began to go on alms rounds in the local village. In this way he regained his previous luster, appearance, and strength
Mahita
Praśānta
Monks, when King Śuddhodana heard those verses
Through the power of the Buddha, they recalled the blessed buddhas of innumerable and incalculable eons, remembering the qualities of the buddha realms of each blessed buddha, as well as the retinue that surrounded the buddhas and the teachings they gave
Struck by the light of wisdom free from attachment, which arouses the memory of the buddhas of times past, the gods of the pure realms were inspired by these verses and immediately arose from their tranquil absorptions
Because the prince is not after family or caste; rather he is interested in her qualities alone.
On that occasion, he spoke the following verses
not base or cowardly
“Whether she is a girl of royal caste or priestly caste, Merchant caste or servant caste— Report to me whichever girl Possesses these qualities
It must be fearless
This family must have many men and women
Therefore I shall begin to eat solid food again. That way I can regain my physical strength
Monks, the family priest went out to the city of Kapilavastu carrying the written verses, and wandered from house to house looking carefully, searching for a girl with such qualities
and this path would not lead to awakening
However, he did not see such a girl
future beings would not be disposed favorably toward me
If I were to proceed toward the seat of awakening merely by the power of my supernatural knowledge but with my body so critically weak
The girl grabbed hold of the priest’s feet and asked
“O great priest, what is your aim?
“Yet this path cannot be realized by someone who has grown so weak
Again I thought
And so a conviction was born in me: ‘This is the path to awakening!’ 
I rejoiced as I attained the first level of concentration, which is free from desires and negativities, endued with good qualities, reflective, investigative, and full of joy born out of discrimination. I rejoiced as I attained the levels of concentration up to the fourth
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva arose from the seat where he had practiced discipline and hardship for the past six years
“The son of Śuddhodana is sublimely handsome
Replete with thirty-two auspicious marks, he has splendorous qualities
well-known by all, and renowned for their great power
Monks, at that point the Bodhisattva thought to himself
“There are monks and priests in the past
The girl read the verses out loud, then she revealed a smile and spoke in verse to the priest
the future, and the present who cause themselves harm
These marital unions must be between people who are both pure
They experience intense suffering from unbearable heat and go through very unpleasant experiences. In this way they suffer greatly.
“O priest, since I have all of these suitable qualities
May this handsome and gentle prince be my husband
If he consents, there should be no delay
Or I will end up with an inferior, ordinary man.
and marital unions between individuals who are pure
with excellent marital unions in the past
The councilor went before King Śuddhodana and told him what had happened
“I have seen, O King, a girl who would be suitable for the boy.
It must have excellent marital unions
The king asked
“Who does she belong to?” The councilor replied
“Your Majesty, she is the daughter of the Śākya Daṇḍapāṇi.” King Śuddhodana thought to himself
“The boy is unparalleled and inclined toward virtue
Fear is said to be sixth
Your doubt is army number seven
Most girls have no qualities, yet they think of themselves very highly
It must be of a good caste and good clan
I will have some pleasing items made and let the boy distribute them to all the girls
I will choose for the prince whichever girl his eyes linger upon.
It must not be petty or prone to violence
Anger and hypocrisy come eighth
“This family must be noble and it must be known by all
“Fifth is dullness and stupor
What are these sixty-four qualities
“In seven days the prince will give a public showing
He will give pleasing goods to the girls, so all the girls should gather together in the assembly hall at that time.
“But your complexion has faded and is almost gone
Monks, after seven days had passed, the Bodhisattva went to the assembly hall and took his seat on a splendid throne
Then later you will have no regrets
As a living being, you can do that
King Śuddhodana had put some spies in place and ordered them, “Report to me if the boy’s eyes linger upon any particular girl!
Monks, then the girls in the city of Kapilavastu, as many as there were, all came to the assembly hall where the Bodhisattva was seated in order to see him and lay claim to the gifts being offered
Alive, you can practice the Dharma
Monks, then the Bodhisattva gave the pleasing items to the girls according to the order of their arrival
“Life is better for the living
“Friends, the family into which a bodhisattva takes his final birth must have sixty-four excellent qualities
Yet a hero can defeat an army; O Māra, I will easily defeat you
Looking upon the great assembly of bodhisattvas and the great assembly of gods, the Bodhisattva then addressed the gathering
“Sublime Being, what sublime qualities must a precious family have for a bodhisattva to take his final birth there?
With palms joined, they all went before the Bodhisattva and asked him
Yet, although Māra tried his best to harm the Bodhisattva, he never found an opportunity
As it became apparent that it would be impossible to harm the Bodhisattva, Māra, sad and dejected, finally left. It is also expressed in this way
There is a pleasant wilderness With forest thickets full of herbs To the east of Urubilvā, Where the Nairañjanā River flows
“Come, my friends. Let us go before the Bodhisattva himself and ask him what sublime qualities a precious family must have in order for a bodhisattva to take his final birth there.” “Excellent!” they replied
It must not be greedy, but disciplined
It must be wise and watched over by ministers
This family must be creative and thereby enjoy worldly pleasures
It is for their sake that the One with Excellent Intellect Practiced the all-pervasive concentration
This concludes the seventeenth chapter, on practicing austerities
This family should be steadfast in its friendships and safeguard the lives of all the beings throughout the animal kingdom
The girls, however, could not bear the Bodhisattva’s splendor and brilliance and, as soon as they received the gifts, they quickly departed
They must have gratitude and know how to conduct themselves appropriately
Then the daughter of Daṇḍapāṇi Śākya, the Śākya girl named Gopā, surrounded and escorted by an entourage of female servants, came into the assembly hall where the Bodhisattva was seated
She approached the Bodhisattva and stood to one side, staring at him with unblinking eyes
They must not be moved by ambition, anger, ignorance, or fear
When the Bodhisattva had finished distributing all the gifts, she went up to him and, with a smile on her face, said to him
They must be afraid of engaging in negative deeds
They must not dwell in ignorance
This family must be benevolent and industrious
It must be inspired to give, be generous
The people who were positioned as spies came before King Śuddhodana and reported the event, saying
and remember the kindness of others. They must be physically strong, with great power and strength, indeed supreme strength
They must make offerings to the sages, to the gods, and to stūpas, and also pay homage to their ancestors
Rather we should adorn the prince.
“It is not right to strip the prince of his adornments
They must not hold grudges
“This family must be renowned throughout the ten directions and have a vast retinue
There are one thousand two hundred billion gods and humans That are guided in the Three Vehicles
It must not be divided
“Am I, Prince, worthy of this?” she asked
In order to bring benefit to mankind, He practiced the all-pervasive concentration
It must be peerless
But you certainly have come very late.” He then took off his ring, which was worth several hundreds of thousands of silver coins, and gave it to her
This family must be the most senior and the most illustrious among all families
It is difficult to find even over many eons
“I am not ignoring you
The actions and deeds that were described by Kāśyapa Were now being demonstrated
This awakening was the same as the awakening of Krakucchanda
They must have great stores of treasure and grain
Sitting cross-legged On bare ground
When five sages were coursing through the sky
He demonstrated the method of subsisting on A single berry, sesame seed, or rice grain
They could not move beyond the top of the rose apple tree
They must have a great deal of gold, and many jewels, gems, pearls, lapis lazuli, conches, crystals, corals, fine gold, silver, and many other riches and belongings
Thwarted, they relinquished pride and conceit, And all of them were drawn to investigate
Cutting off all movements of the breath, Immutable, he showed his strength
They must have many elephants, horses, camels, oxen, and sheep
It must be a family of universal monarchs. It must be aided, in great measure, by the root virtues accumulated in the pas
Surprised, they joined their hands at their heads And paid homage, bowing down to his feet with palms joined
They descended and settled on the ground, Where they saw the Bodhisattva, the Son of the Śākyas, As he sat cross-legged at the trunk of the rose apple tree, practicing concentration, Shining and brilliant like the glow of gold from the Jāmbū River
In his final existence, a bodhisattva must be conceived in the womb of a woman with all of these excellent qualities
Yet immovable and calm
“At the time of the five degenerations, When lowly people devoted themselves to non-Dharma
“Friends, a bodhisattva is not conceived in his mother’s womb while the moon is waning
I was born in this world, Where people endowed with leisure practice Dharma
“The world is full of extremists, Who act out of curiosity or for the sake of good luck
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva displayed true wonders to the world
A bodhisattva in his final existence must be conceived during a full moon. On the fifteenth day of the waxing moon, and in conjunction with the constellation Puṣya
“Where can a family with the qualities described by this holy being be found?” Pondering this question, they then thought
“The seat of the Śākyas is wealthy, prosperous, agreeable, and pleasant
It has bountiful harvests and is teeming with people
Its king, Śuddhodana, descends from pure families on both his mother’s and father’s side. His wife as well is pure
His deeds are not swayed by the afflictions, and he bears excellent physical characteristics
Extremely wise and endowed with brilliant merit
Indeed he is a Dharma king who guides according to the Dharma
The hot season, the winter, and the great clouds, storms, rain, and lightning of autumn  all assailed the body of the Bodhisattva
He rules over all the lands of the Śākya clan and is honored and revered by all the merchants, householders, ministers, and people in his court
and does not hold negative views
He never lay down on his belly, side, or back
He believes in karm
He has incalculable wealth and treasures and innumerable precious jewels
the king comes from an illustrious family and is descended from a line of universal monarchs
“The city of Kapilavastu is the abode of sentient beings who have generated basic virtues
to teach the qualities of great wisdom
All those who are born there are equal in fortune to the king
and to distinguish the levels of absorption
The wife of King Śuddhodana is Māyādevī, the daughter of Suprabuddhā, a ruler of the Śākya clan. She is wealthy and youthful. Indeed she is in the prime of life. She has an excellent figure and has not given birth
The gods in the sky showered down a rain of flowers and called out these verses
She has no sons or daughters
With a beautiful form
Merely by his touch, they fell to the ground
as pleasing to the eye as a finely drawn picture
In this way the Bodhisattva spent six years, during which time his body became increasingly feeble, weak, and emaciated
she is bedecked with jewelry like a celestial maiden
Then hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joy
free from the faults of womankind
She speaks the truth
Those who passed by the Bodhisattva, such as village boys or girls, ox herders, cow herders, grass collectors, wood collectors, and those looking for dung, all thought he was a demon made of dust. They made fun of him and sprinkled him with dust
However, as soon as the Bodhisattva touched them, they were unable to withstand his splendor, brilliance, physical strength, and stamina
Exhilarated, they all assailed the Bodhisattva
Then the Bodhisattva said, “Enough of this quarrel. You should now all join up and confront me in wrestling.
Her limbs are firm and gently curved like the arch of a rainbow
But as soon as the Bodhisattva merely touched the two boys, they were unable to withstand the Bodhisattva’s power and brilliance, and they collapsed on the ground
First Nanda and Ānanda approached the Bodhisattva to wrestle with him
Her nose is well formed with a beautiful complexion
Her eyes are as pure as the petals of a newly blossomed lotus flower
and her skin is as soft as kācilindika cloth
The movement of her limbs is gentle
Monks, I then thought to myself, “There are some monks and priests who believe that they are purified by abstaining from eating food
carefully guarding her limbs, eyes, and mind
rather she is patient and of good character
She has little attachment, anger, and ignorance
“Oh my, the mendicant Gautama has turned black! Have you seen, he’s so dark! The mendicant Gautama has the color of the madgura fish
and not prone to idle or frivolous chatte
“Even if all the myriad beings in the ten directions Became like mighty wrestlers inclined to foul play And converged on this bull among men, His mere touch would bring them to the ground
Like an old stable for horses or elephants where the two sides have caved in and made the inside rafters visible
Monks, as I now began living on just a single juniper berry, never taking a second, my body became extremely weak and emaciated
Monks, my limbs and joints began to resemble the knots of the āsītakī plant or the kālā plant
My rib cage resembled the sides of a crab
In this way the Bodhisattva, fighting alone, was the winner
In that way it is similar to space, and therefore it is described as such
Always smiling
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva displayed true wonders to the worldly ones
Daṇḍapāṇi struck the drum target eight times shouting-distance away and pierced it, but he also could not shoot any farther than that
Devadatta struck the drum target four times shouting-distance away, but he also could not shoot any farther
Ānanda struck his drum target twice shouting-distance away, but he could not shoot any farther
He did so in order to shatter the proud satisfaction of extreme practitioners, to vanquish the opponents’ attacks
Behind the drum he set up seven palm trees, and beyond that he set up an iron image of a wild boar
Finally the Bodhisattva placed an iron drum ten times shouting-distance away as his target
Her hair, as black as a bee, frames a fine forehead and a beautiful brow
Daṇḍapāṇi placed an iron drum eight times shouting-distance away as his target
Her head, ears, and nose are perfectly symmetrical
to attract the gods, and to correct nihilists and eternalists, who disregard karmic action
Then Sundarananda placed an iron drum six times shouting-distance away as his target
He also did so in order to declare the results of merit, to teach the results of wisdom
Next Devadatta placed an iron drum four times shouting-distance away as his target
to distinguish the levels of concentration
First Ānanda placed an iron drum  twice shouting-distance away as his target
to demonstrate the power and strength of the body
Under the most excellent lord of trees, he will vanquish this friend of darkness And peacefully attain unexcelled awakening.
“Māyādevī is reserved, free of anger, pride, conceit, and arrogance
“Through the strength of his love, he will vanquish Māra— That mighty, foul-playing wrestler—along with his bannered forces of footmen and cavalry
She does not get indignant or jealous
rather what she says is timely
and she gives generously
She is disciplined and devoted to her husband
unconcerned with other men
Every part of her body is beautiful and free of faults
“King, is there any other bow here in the city that I can string or that can withstand my physical strength?
“Yes, my son, there is.” replied the king
“Where is it?” asked the boy
“Son,” the king answered, “your grandfather was called Siṃhahanu
He had a bow that is now being honored in the temple with incense and flower garlands
No one since him has been able to string the bow, let alone draw it.
The Bodhisattva said
“King Śuddhodana belongs to a royal family
The Śākya clan alone was seen to be free of faults
Then the bow was placed before the Śākya Daṇḍapāṇi, who mustered all his bodily strength and endurance and tried to string the bow, but could not
Finally the bow was placed before the Bodhisattva
He picked it up and, sitting on his seat in the cross-legged position, he held it with his left hand and strung it with a single fingertip of his right hand
Previously no student, master, solitary buddha, or bodhisattva who had taken up such conduct had ever entered this absorption
All the major royal families and royal lines Were found to be flawed. Considering this
While he was stringing the bow, a sound resonated throughout the entire city of Kapilavastu
Looking throughout all Jambudvīpa
All the townspeople became agitated and asked one another where the sound came from
Some said, “The sound is surely from Prince Sarvārthasiddha, who has strung his grandfather’s bow.
Then hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joy
And where are the father and mother with pure qualities?
“What family is known to be pure And fitting for the Bodhisattva to take birth in
Seated there, they entertained this thought
All the while the images of Śakra, lord of the gods, and those of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three were reflected within the temple
Thus nowhere else were the Bodhisattva’s enjoyments as perfectly pure as in the womb of his mother
Monks, when Śakra, lord of the gods, and the other gods wished to depart, the Bodhisattva, who knew full well their thoughts
Bodhisattvas of great renown and gods Equal in fortune to himself gathered around the Sage
extended his right hand as a farewell greeting
As he retracted his hand, there was no harm done to his mother
At that time Śakra, lord of the gods, and the other gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three reflected, “We have been dismissed by the Bodhisattva.
Then they circled around the Bodhisattva and his mother three times before departing
Monks, noontime passed, and it was now evening when Brahmā
lord of the Sahā World, surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of gods, approached the Bodhisattva carrying a drop of the vital force of the divine realms
They came to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration, and also to listen to the Dharma
Monks, the Bodhisattva knew that Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, was arriving together with his retinue, and again he raised his golden-colored right hand
He cordially greeted Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, and those gods of the pure realms, and pointed out their seats to them
“They believe that they become pure by reciting oṃ, vaṣaṭ, svadhā, svāhā, the benedictions, collected praises, or invocations; by repeating mantras or dhāraṇīs; or by practicing meditation
They use burning chaff and coals and tandoor ovens. They walk on glowing rocks, scorching fire, or scalding water. Some go to a sacred riverbank and die there. They follow the course of such practices
Monks, again it was not possible  for Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, to resist the Bodhisattva’s command
Thus Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, as well as the other gods of the pure realms, settled on those seats that had been arranged
She is also skilled in all the arts
Since her form is like a magical emanation, the word māyā, meaning ‘magically emanated,’ was included in her name
her form is superior even when compared with other beautiful women. Indeed she is without peer
She is attractive to others, with faultless eyes. Alluring to the mind and pleasing to the eye
The palms of her hands and the soles of her feet are like liquid lac
Monks, from everywhere, such as the east, the south, the west, the north
above and below, many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva
came to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration, and also to listen to the Dharma and correctly proclaim that Dharma
and calves like an antelope’s
Once they had arrived, the Bodhisattva’s body began emitting light, which manifested into lion thrones
She has thighs that are as well proportioned as an elephant’s trunk
The Bodhisattva then indicated to the bodhisattvas to take their seat on these thrones
Finally the Bodhisattva let his hand rest while maintaining mindfulness and carefulness
and it is perfect for someone of noble family who is wholly dedicated to renunciation
As he retracted his hand with mindfulness and carefulness, there was no harm done to his mother
Monks, when Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, and those gods of the pure realms wished to depart, the Bodhisattva, who knew full well their thoughts, extended his right hand as a farewell greeting
When the Bodhisattva knew that they were settled, he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed them, inspired them, and delighted them
In whichever direction the Bodhisattva would extend his hand, the mother of the Bodhisattva would turn to face that way
Her hips are smooth, wide, round, and firm. Her body is as firm as a vajra
Then the gods reflected, “The Bodhisattva is having a heartwarming conversation with us.” And each one of them thought, “The Bodhisattva is speaking directly to me; to me alone he extends a friendly welcome.
a waist curved like the arch of a bow, perfect sides, and a deep navel
She has sloping shoulders, tapering arms
and teeth as white as jasmine and sumana flowers
She is attractive, with lips as red as the bimba fruit, a tapered neck bedecked with jewelry
He descends from a pure line of monarchs
Wealthy, prosperous, and free from conflicts
A holy being, he is righteous and has gained respect
“All the other beings in the city of Kapilavastu Are righteous and pure in mind
The city is filled with gardens, groves, and palaces
The beautiful city of Kapilavastu is the most suitable birthplace
“All its inhabitants are mighty and powerful
With the strength of two or even three elephants
They have perfected their training in archery and weapons And do not harm others, even to protect their own lives
“King Śuddhodana’s wife is supreme Among one thousand other sublime women
Enchanting in appearance, like a magical emanation
This made the Bodhisattva very delighted, and he thought to himself
“What an amazing place! It is so pleasant
He witnessed its pure water and beautiful bathing areas and saw how trees and groves adorned the riverbank and the surrounding village
On the way he passed by the Nairañjanā River
Any being, whether a god or a human, Could never see enough of Māyā
“She harbors no attachment or hatred
For she has abstained from sexual activity for thirty-two months
She has fulfilled her vow, given to her by the king
in doing so I have become capable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is much supreme to the highest human teaching.
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva remained in Gaya at the peak of Mount Gaya for as long as he pleased before he proceeded by foot to the village Senāpati near Urubilvā
Never frowning and always with a smile on her face
“With a good conscience and a sense of modesty, she observes the Dharma
She is free of pride and conceit, and not prone to overexuberance
Just as she has no envy and is free of guile and artifice
She delights in giving and is always loving in her thoughts
“Believing in karma and abandoning misguided deeds
She is gentle and tender, and her speech honest and mellifluous. Neither harsh nor abrasive, she is extremely tranquil
This was the third example that he had never thought or heard of that came to the Bodhisattva’s mind
She adheres to what is true, controlled in body and mind
Monks, then the Bodhisattva thought to himself
“I have also separated my body from the objects of desire
She is free from the multitude of faults That are commonly found in women the whole world over
“Indeed Māyādevī is without rival, For no other woman in the realm of humans can match her, Nor so in the realm of gandharvas, or even in the heavenly realms
She is worthy of being the mother of the Great Sage
“For five hundred lifetimes
she alone Has been the mother of the Bodhisattva
Just as King Śuddhodana has been his father
She thus has all the qualities of a worthy mother
“As disciplined as an ascetic, she follows a strict code of conduct, And while following her own conduct
“Wherever she may be, whether sitting or standing, Lying down or in motion
in doing so they do become capable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is much supreme to the highest human teaching.
Monks, in the early morning the four great kings and the twenty-eight great commanders of the yakṣas together with five hundred yakṣas arrived to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration, and also to listen to the Dharma
Hearing these words, all the gods in the Heaven of Joy, along with the assembly of goddesses, gathered together in the great celestial palace
“Come, gather here,” he said. “Come listen to the Bodhisattva’s final teaching on the Dharma, a recollection of the Dharma entitled ‘The Application of Passing.’ 
The Bodhisattva had come to this great celestial palace where he now addressed all the gods of the Heaven of Joy
Monks, while the Bodhisattva was seeing the family of his birth
This concludes the third chapter, on the purity of the family
Proclaimed the sublime Māyā to be the mother, Saying, “She is fit to give birth to the joy of the Śākya family.
With these words of praise, the gods And bodhisattvas, with their vast knowledge
At that time the Bodhisattva, who was aware of their arrival, extended his right hand and pointed out their seats
The guardians of the world and the other guests sat down on the arranged seats
The four great kings understood the greeting and thought, “We have been dismissed by the Bodhisattva.
Then they circled around the Bodhisattva and his mother three times before departing
As he retracted his hand, there was no harm done to his mother
No woman would be able to carry The supreme man of Jambudvīpa.
“Other than Devī, who is endowed with the most supreme of qualities And has the strength of ten thousand elephants
Thus, since these two are endowed with supreme qualities, One will be the son, and one is worthy to be the mother
“In this way Māyā is a suitable vessel; In this way the Holy Being is supremely beautiful
The king’s vast empire increases in prosperity. Unmatched by the neighboring kings, The ruler’s renown and fame also continue to increase
“Due to the virtuous deeds of Māyādevī
They all look upon her as a mother or a daughter, For she follows the right conduct and is endowed with noble qualities
“No being, whether god, demigod, or human, Is able to look upon her with a lustful mind
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva became very skilled at initiating delightful salutations as he dwelt in his mother’s womb
those places Become filled with the brilliant light Given off by her dedication to virtuous deeds
in doing so they do become capable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is superior to human teaching
There was no one, whether god, nāga, yakṣa, human, or nonhuman, who was ever able to greet the Bodhisattva first with a delightful salutation
Instead the Bodhisattva would initiate the salutations, and afterward the mother of the Bodhisattva would joyfully welcome the guests
Although they do harm themselves and torment their bodies and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of suffering as if being burned
When the morning had passe
and the noon hour arrived, Śakra, the lord of the gods
along with the most eminent gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, came to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration, and also to listen to the Dharma
The Bodhisattva, who saw them coming from a distance
There the Bodhisattva blessed the surrounding area, which was as vast as the entire world with its four great continents
“Friends,” he said, “look upon the body of the Bodhisattva, adorned as it is with the signs of a hundred merits
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva sat upon a grand lion throne with these qualities and spoke to the great gathering of gods
This throne came about due to the force of the ripening of merit amassed through the perfections carried out over billions upon billions of eons, indeed incalculable eons
extended his golden-colored right hand and, to the delight of Śakra, lord of the gods, and the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, pointed out their seats
Billions upon billions of bodhisattvas surrounded it, and billions upon billions of buddhas from the ten directions, infinite in number, focused their attention on it
while hundreds of thousands of Śakras offered prostrations, and hundreds of thousands of Brahmās bowed down before the throne
proclaiming hundreds of thousands of sublime qualities
Hundreds of thousands of guardians of the world stood watch
Hundreds of thousands of goddesses sang, danced, and played instruments
When the Bodhisattva knew that they were settled, he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed them, inspired them, and delighted them
and it was ornamented with many hundreds of thousands of silk tassels and garlands
In whichever direction the Bodhisattva would extend his hand, the mother of the Bodhisattva would turn to face that way
Then the gods reflected, “The Bodhisattva is having a heartwarming conversation with us.
Hanging from it were many hundreds of thousands of silk streamers
And each one of them thought, “The Bodhisattva is speaking directly to me; to me alone he extends a friendly welcome.
and it was covered with many hundreds of thousands of nets made of precious jewels
the throne radiated the sounds of hundreds of thousands of jeweled bells
and giving off the sound of strings from jeweled chimes. Delightful to behold
draped with nets of priceless gems
Scented with the fragrant smells of various celestial perfumes and the finest of incense
and piles of cushions covered in celestial cloth sat upon it
The Bodhisattva was seated upon a lion throne that was utterly resplendent as a result of the ripening of his merit. The base of the throne was bedecked with various precious jewels
The area was so splendid, so beautiful to behold, so filled with ornaments, and so enchanting that all the gods of the desire and form realms came to think that their own homes seemed like charnel grounds in comparison
Look upon those innumerable and uncountable  bodhisattvas who dwell in the ten directions, in the east, south, west, and north, above, below, and all around, and who are now in the sublime realm of the Heaven of Joy
They are all approaching their final existence and, surrounded by an assembly of gods, they each delight the gods with the appearance of their passing, demonstrating the gateway to the light of Dharma
Observing them, they faced the Bodhisattva, joined their palms, and bowed down before him
Mental restraint is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
The mother of the Bodhisattva could also see the Bodhisattva within her womb
In the same way that a lightning bolt illumines everything as it emerges from a mass of clouds
for with it covetousness, malice, and misguided views are abandoned
Verbal restraint is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for with it the four verbal faults are relinquished
Physical restraint is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for with it the three physical faults are purified
Contentment is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for with it the mind becomes pure
Supreme joy is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for with it the body becomes extremely pliable
Inspiration is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for with it the mind is divested of impurities
There are  gateways to the light of the Dharma, and they must be taught without fail to a gathering of gods by a bodhisattva at the time of his passing
“Friends, please listen to the gateways to the light of the Dharma that delight the gods, which these bodhisattvas teach the gods by the way in which they pass away
The Bodhisattva then addressed the great assembly of gods with the following words
And in their doorways and windows
As the king hears these reports
Prostrating with their entire bodies, they exclaimed, “How wondrous! The blessings of the Bodhisattva are indeed inconceivable, for we can see all these bodhisattvas by merely directing our gaze.
He is overjoyed and comes to his balcony
There he sees the Perfect Being, the Bodhisattva, Who shines with beauty like well-refined gold
for it leads one to not condemn others

Once there I took up residence at Pāṇḍava, the king of mountains, where I stayed on its slope alone in solitude without any company. At that time many trillions of gods protected me
One morning I dressed in the skirt and robes of a mendicant and
holding my offering bowl, I went into the city of Rājagṛha through the Gate of Warm Water and started my alms round

Thousands of women stand on their roof
So now both of us should assume patronage of the students.
After he made that offer, Ārāḍa Kālāma honored me with exquisite offering
and installed me as a teacher in residence, who would share his duties with him
It would not bring total freedom from suffering for either of us
The elimination of attachment and aversion is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for it eliminates judgmental thoughts
So now I must depart and search for a better practice.
“ ‘Kaṇṭhaka, because of your meritorious deed, You will be magically reborn in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
Expertise concerning the aggregates is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for it leads to thorough understanding of suffering
There was not a place to be found Not walked upon by the millions of gods, who said
They all gave Kaṇṭhaka strength As they sang to him in the most delightful and touching way
Equality of the elements is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for it leads to the relinquishment of the source of suffering
Withdrawal of the senses is a gateway to the light of the Dharma, for it leads one to meditate on the path
“ ‘Kaṇṭhaka, carry the guide of this world! Be swift and don’t feel sad
At the time that the Guide, the Lion of Men, passes away And descends from the supreme realm of the Heaven of Joy, He proclaims these words to the gods
“Gopā, do not shed any more tears! Be happy and rejoice
It is the nature of things that a great bodhisattva is born into the human world
“Gopā, one should never shed tears over people Who do such excellent deeds
Before long you will witness the best among men attaining awakening. You will see him honored and served by the immortals
Having renounced his home, he attains perfect and complete awakening and turns the wheel of Dharma
But I have no ability, fortitude, and strength.
“Abandon all forms of mindlessness! “The multitude of divine pleasures
All wonderful things conjured up by the mind, All of this is caused by virtuous actions
“Your kinfolk, the best of people, may beat me and ask
‘Chanda, where have you taken the virtuous Bodhisattva?
and others shed tears, wiping their faces with their garments
Some slapped their thighs with their hands, and others beat their chests
Some slapped their arms with their hands, and others beat their heads
When these four goddesses knew that the Bodhisattva had entered the womb of his mother, they kept a constant guard over him
In addition, when Śakra, lord of the gods, discovered that the Bodhisattva had entered the womb of his mother, he brought along five hundred gods to constantly follow the Bodhisattva
The body of a bodhisattva who has entered the womb of his mother develops certain features
worthy of all gods’ worship
For example, it is like a great fire burning on a mountaintop during the darkest night, visible from a league or even five leagues away
The body of the Bodhisattva as he entered the womb of his mother was just this way
It was radiant, well formed, handsome, and pleasing to see
As he sat with crossed legs inside that peaked structure, he was exceedingly beautiful. He appeared to have a golden hue, shining like refined gold adorned with precious beryl
“Please recall the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, And do not slip into heedlessness
Those who delight in study, discipline, and generosity Are endowed with patience and gentleness
Engage in wholesome activities
For actions done well bring no torment
“Therefore be harmonious with one another; Act with a loving and benevolent mind
“The pleasure brought about by the qualities Of desirable things is as unsatisfying as drinking salt water
But those with noble pristine knowledge That transcends the world are satisfied
Moreover, within the precious structure that delighted the Bodhisattva, a set of garments appeared, known as the ornament of a hundred thousand
With his pure, stainless, and sublime mind
he perfected millions of qualities
“He is a refuge for the frightened
and a lamp for the blind
Apart from a bodhisattva in his final existence, no other being anywhere could ever receive such garments
He is a place of rest for the persecuted
In fact all possible sublime and perfect forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures were present within that peaked structure
“Until I have attained precious awakening, The supreme level of immortality beyond old age and dying
“Once you develop respect for me, Apply yourselves earnestly to practicing The teachings that you have heard
he gave medicine to the sick
And you will inevitably attain boundless joy. “All desirable things are impermanent and unstable
fulfilled the wishes of those who had aspirations, and never abandoned those who came to him for refuge
Nothing is eternal, not even the eons.  Everything is like a mirage or an illusion
And as fleeting as lightning or a water bubble
“No longer will I behold the assembly of divine siddhas Who make offerings to you day and night
Nor will I be able to smell any longer the divine scents
When the Bodhisattva was practicing the conduct of a bodhisattva for extended periods in the past
What were the previous actions that prepared the Bodhisattva for digesting this drop of vital energy
After exhausting your previous stores of merit
If you, who conquers emotions, abandons this palace tonight
There is only unhappiness and suffering there
Do not fall back into the three lower realm
“This palace, if abandoned by you, Will be like a withered and used garland
“In the realm of the conditioned, there are no allies, No friends, no relatives, and no retinue
It will seem like an empty stage. When you are gone, all magnificence and splendor will disappear
taming Māra and his army, and awakening to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood
“When shall we see him accessing the ten powers of the thus-gone ones, the four types of fearlessness of the thus-gone ones, and the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha
A fire is born in dependence on conditions. It is born, fulfills its purpose, and quickly ceases. “In this way some scholars investigate: ‘Where does this come from and where does it proceed?
“Remember your previous actions! Charioteer, do not forget to bring this noble wealth To those who are depressed, poor, and suffering
The great Brahmā placed this drop into a beautiful vessel of beryl and offered it to the Bodhisattva
The Bodhisattva accepted the gift and, out of affection for the great Brahmā, he drank it
He taught the Dharma without seeking rewards
Regarding the Dharma, he never held back anything as a teacher
He was without any stinginess when it came to teaching the Dharma
He practiced the Dharma that he taught
He was brave in making the Dharma manifest
He found his home in the Dharma
his protection in the Dharma, and his refuge in the Dharma
Only then would he cater to his own needs. It was as a result of this activity that the great Brahmā offered the Bodhisattva this drop of nectar
His point of reference was the Dharma, and his ultimate resort was the Dharma
Within that temple all the most excellent and exquisite pleasures and amusements came together, manifesting due to the maturation of the Bodhisattva’s previous actions
Monks, the Bodhisattva demonstrated, with a playful mastery of his great skillful means, the actions conforming to the wishes of his entire retinue of consorts
“Whatever miraculous powers you see in me
He was acting in conformity with the bodhisattvas of the past who, while being beyond the world, acted in worldly ways
Since the Bodhisattva had long ago realized the shortcomings of desire, he now demonstrated sensual enjoyment, without himself wanting it, simply in order to ripen others
And whatever eloquence, wisdom, and qualities I may have
By the unique power of the accumulation of merit, gathered through limitless roots of virtue, he demonstrated the qualities of the ruler of the world
Monks, in that way the Bodhisattva taught this Dharma discourse to the large congregation of gods
This concludes the fourth chapter, on the gateways to the light of the Dharma
should come And listen to the true Dharma.
You, who have pure minds
“When I attain awakening And shower down the teaching that leads to immortality
If you do not abide by this teaching, Then it is not the fault of the teaching
and eliminating the darkness and obscuring film of ignorance
“Freed from pride, arrogance, and conceit, Always flexible, upright, and honest
He demonstrated a complete enjoyment of the delightful forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures that went far beyond anything known to gods and humans in terms of quality and extent
Dedicate yourself to reaching the transcendence of sufferin
And apply yourself to realizing the path
He demonstrated a mastery of mind, which was free from attachment to any of his delightful maidens of pleasure
“Disperse all the darkness and turbidity of ignorance With the lamp of knowledge
He ripened those who were now in his company as friends, due to the power of their previous aspirations and their accumulated roots of virtue
As such he was able to stay among the consorts without ever being disturbed by the stains of worldly emotions
He would become a conqueror, a righteous Dharma king. Such a king would have the seven treasures
Using the vajra of wisdom
While watching for the time to ripen the potential in those who were around him, the Bodhisattva kept his former promise acutely in mind
“What need is there to say many things? It is in your interest to follow this teaching
the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious jewel, the precious wife, the precious steward, and the precious minister
“Therefore, having now obtained freedom, A spiritual guide, and a conducive environment
And having met with the superior teaching of Dharma, You should pacify attachment and the other afflictions
“Recall all the suffering you have experienced Circling through cyclic existence until now
If you fall prey to distortions, Nirvāṇa and freedom from attachment will not be achieved
“Do not simply follow what other people say
Monks, from the very beginning the Bodhisattva had already understood the many shortcomings of cyclic existence
With all his heart, he stopped striving after compounded phenomena, as well as all kinds of grasping and clinging
Instead he now only felt interest in the Buddhadharma
He turned toward the state of nirvāṇa and turned his back on saṃsāra
“For the welfare, benefit, and love of sentient beings
You should emulate me with your discipline, study
Conscientiousness, generosity
Restraint, and self-control
All of this is caused by virtuous deeds Arising from study, discipline, and conscientiousness
And practice what you teach
“For you will not be able to accomplish the auspicious teachings By the mere sound of your voice and speech. Please adopt the right conduc
Tear the net of error, with its latencies
Thus it was that the Bodhisattva enthroned the bodhisattva Maitreya in the Heaven of Joy
He was never sad
and skilled in the art of attracting others
saturated with great compassion
He was filled with love
To this, the Bodhisattva replied to the great retinue of gods, “The bodhisattva Maitreya will teach you the Dharma.
He had compassion for the world and wanted to help
Hearing that, the gods of the Heaven of Joy wept and embraced the feet of the Bodhisattva
They said, “Virtuous One, without you, this Heaven of Joy will  lose its splendor.
In the past when I practiced the conduct of a bodhisattva
He broke free from the evil shackles of Māra
extricated himself from the prison of cyclic existence
and directed his attention to nirvāṇa
“Lord, you cut off your own flesh
This shower of celestial flowers Is the fruition of that generosity
You gave up your dear sons and daughters
Today we bring forth a great offering to you. “In the past, for billions of eons
You have purified the mode of all phenomena
You have appeared through virtue gathered over a long time
“You previously accumulated virtuous actions
He strove to be of help, both for himself and for others, and was a hero in unexcelled persistence
He wished to be of service to the world and to assist the world
He wished happiness and the peace of accomplishment for the world
Hundreds of millions of gods lifted and carried that great mansion using their hands, shoulders, and the crowns of their heads
the Bodhisattva kept his former promise acutely in mind
“Will we ever witness the Bodhisattva—this sacred, supreme, and pure being—leave home as an act of renunciation
Trillions of divine and human musical instruments played sweet sounds without even being touched or played
Full of respect and devotion, they joined their palms and bowed before him. Standing expectantly in his presence, they asked with concern
and saw each other as parents and children
Then the whole billionfold world system shook in six ways and exhibited eighteen great signs
It began to quiver, tremble, quake, move, make sound, and roar, each in three degrees of intensity
“You, virtuous one, shall awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood after me.
Who has attained complete mastery of all types of power
With a delightful voice he spoke
Thereafter Śakra, lord of the gods, arrived together with the gods from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, bringing divine flowers, perfumes, garlands, ointments, scented powders, garments, parasols, victory banners, flags, earrings, and adornments
he would first joyfully welcome them, and then his mother would do the same
At other times when people came to see the Bodhisattva, be they women or men, boys or girls
Yet before he enters his mother’s womb, a temple of precious materials is manifested on the right side of the mother’s womb
When the Bodhisattva knew that they were settled, he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed them
As such Queen Māyā saw the arrival of an elephant in her dream
The body of a bodhisattva in his last existence is free from the four stages  of embryonic development. Instead he appears seated, with all his limbs, organs, and characteristics fully formed
Then as a bodhisattva transmigrates from the Heaven of Joy, he remains seated in a cross-legged position in that tiered chamber
Likewise the sufferings experienced by beings in the realm of the lord of death, such as hunger and thirst, were also pacified
Likewise, while the Bodhisattva was residing in the womb of his mother, the glory, brilliance, and color of the Bodhisattva illuminated the south, the west, and the north, below and above. In fact all the ten directions were bathed in light for several miles in each direction
He is called the one who has conquered the great darkness of ignorance
the one who is not stained by worldly concerns, the protector of the world
This wheel is inexpressible because it is beyond all paths of audible words. “It is limitless. It is without example because it is beyond exemplification. It is like the sky; it does not cease, yet neither is it permanent
Therefore, Lord, please be kind enough to explain what kind of wheel is the wheel of Dharma, which has been turned by the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Buddha.
a wheel of cessation, and a wheel that engages with the enlightened mind of the thus-gone ones
they developed the power of love and entered into supreme and auspicious awakening
Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha’s eyelashes are like those of a bull
Seven of his body parts are well-rounded
He has forty teeth.  He has even teeth
His teeth are without gaps between them
His teeth are perfectly white
Great king, marks of this type are not found on the body of a universal monarch
The Thus-Gone One replied: “I am a worthy one of the world; I am the unsurpassed teacher
The Thus-Gone One replied: “The victorious ones should be known to be like me, Who has exhausted all faults
When Kubera arrived, he also began to circumambulate the city of Kapilavastu. Then he settled in the northern direction, from where he had arrived, and paid homage to the Bodhisattva
I have conquered all evil dharmas; Therefore, my friend, I am indeed a victorious one.
The mendicant then asked, “Venerable Gautama, where will you go now?” The Thus-Gone One replied
This concludes the twenty-fifth chapter, on exhortation
The great king Kubera arrived from the north with several trillion yakṣas holding in their hands precious jewels of the type called starlight. They also carried oil lamps and lighted lanterns. They held in their hands various weapons, such as bows and arrows, swords, spears, lances with two and three points, discuses, one-pointed pikes, and javelins, and they were armed with strong armor and helmets
The great king Virūpākṣa arrived from the west with several trillion nāgas holding in their hands various necklaces made of pearls and different types of precious gems
They sent forth a gentle breeze from a rain of flowers and perfumed powders that emitted beautiful scents. When Virūpākṣa arrived, he also circumambulated the city of Kapilavastu. Stopping in the west, from where he had arrived, he paid homage to the Bodhisattva
When he arrived there, he began to circumambulate the city of Kapilavastu. Then he settled together with his retinue in the space above, in the same direction from which he had come, and began to pay homage to the Bodhisattva
Preserve them! They will become honored as sacred objects
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then thought
“These four devoted great kings are giving me four stone alms bowls
But four are too many for me
Yet if I were to accept only one, the other three would be upset
So I will take all four alms bowls and transform them into one.
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then extended his right hand and spoke to the great king Vaiśravaṇa in verse
“Offer an alms bowl to the Bliss-Gone One! You will become a vessel of the Supreme Vehicle
By offering an alms bowl to the likes of me
You will never be bereft of mindfulness and intelligence.
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then accepted the alms bowl from the great king Vaiśravaṇa, regarding him with compassion
“It would not be appropriate for me to take these alms with my hands. What vessel did the previous perfect and complete awakened ones use to accept alms?” Right then the answer dawned on him
“Your feet are covered with wheels And shine with the brilliance of stainless, thousand-petaled lotuses
and the intelligent ones disparage them. Yet the ignorant embrace them, and the immature rely on them.
Later, when we are old, We can practice disciplined conduct and austerities!
Their skin, flesh, and blood had dried out, and their ears, noses, hands, feet, eyes, or heads were cut
Afterward the Bodhisattva felt tired and wanted to step out of the pond
one earth god called out to the sky gods
As I stood there, bent over with my left leg stretched out and my right hand reaching down in order to pick up the rag
“Could you please allow me to follow you so that I can obtain the instructions for your path of absorption?
So please stay in my kingdom and enjoy yourself.
“It seems that Brahmā himself is doing alms rounds in our city
“You have served and paid respect To the One Who Benefits Beings; Thus you will find supreme and inconceivable attainment
When you assist the protector of this world, You are free from the dangers of the lower realms and difficult rebirths.
They resound with the tinkling of tiny bejeweled bells on latticed draperies
“The noble Kaṇṭhaka, at a mere sign, Carried the protector of this world across the sky
Why did you not tell us That our benefactor was leaving
“Alas, my dear one with a beautiful nose, beautiful eyebrows, And the stainless circling hair between your brows
When Gopā saw Chanda and the noble horse
“Chanda, now explain to me truly, right here
he felt sad and asked
Everyone thought that the young prince was still asleep in his bed
The gods of the pure realms then thought
Next he meditated the fact that his own body was just like theirs
“Immaculate One, Faultless One, let me go with you, Wherever you wish to depart for
and so he truly saw the shortcomings of the physical body
“Oh no, what shall I do now? Who can help? To whom should I turn
“You have been encouraged by the god Sañcodaka
Then he let go of his attachment toward the body
destroying his perception of it as being attractive and instead seeing it as repulsive
At this moment the gods who were watching from the sky uttered cries of joy and rained down flowers, exclaiming
Do you not see them, my Lord? Where will you go
“Listen, Chanda
Like a deep abyss, they are abandoned entirely by wise people
These childish beings are wounded because of seeking a taste
“However, Your Majesty, this light is lovely and pleasant
It is soothing, auspicious, and does not burn
Their heads and bodies do not match; Such is the army of soldiers approaching
“Use all your female trickery and keep persevering with the young prince so that when his mind becomes attached to you, he will not want to leave for the sake of ordination!
At the quarters of the consorts he directed everyone to  continuously sing and play music, and not to stop for even a moment. “You must apply all your skills in pleasure and games!” he told them
The rain of the sublime teaching will refresh those who are tormented by the flames of desire, anger, and stupidity
Even your father, mother, friends, and relatives Are not free from old age, nor is any other class of people.
The Bodhisattva then remarked: “Charioteer, how sad! Childish and ignorant beings do not see old age, Proud and crazed as they are in youth
I will go back now—quick, turn my chariot around
If I shall also be old, how can I enjoy myself and play games?
So the Bodhisattva turned his fine chariot around and returned to the city
“He will lead onto the straight path to nirvāṇa those beings who are veiled by a variety of mistaken views and who have entered mistaken paths
He will free from bondage those who are trapped in the cage and prison of saṃsāra and who are bound by the fetters of disturbing emotions
In those beings who are blinded by darkness, clouded vision, and the cataract of ignorance, he will engender the eye of insight
For those beings who are wounded by the thorn of disturbing emotions, he will pull out that thorn
Great King, an uḍumbara flower sometimes, though rarely, blooms in the world
he saw on the road a dead man who had reached his end. The corpse was lying on a stretcher, covered by a cotton cloth
Great King, in the same way, rarely, once in many millions of years, a blessed buddha is born in the world
And so, monks, once again the Bodhisattva turned his beautiful chariot around and returned to the city
And this great prince will certainly awaken to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood
However, monks, sometime later, while the Bodhisattva was setting out for the parks through the western city gate, accompanied by a large parade
It was surrounded by a group of relatives who wailed, cried, and lamented
Yet I shall not live to see this jewel of the Buddha
Would have a positive view of playful games?
The Bodhisattva then exclaimed: “Health is just like a play in a dream
What wise person, having witnessed Such unbearable terrors of disease
He has no protection, refuge, or sanctuary, and nowhere to go.
The splendor of his former health is gone and his strength has been lost
The charioteer replied: “Your Highness, that man is seriously ill; Confronted by the terrors of disease, he is now on the brink of death
He is lying in his own excrement, in a revolting state.
He is so skinny, his belly is in convulsions, and he suffers
His senses are weak, he is crippled, and he breathes so heavily
“Charioteer, the body of this poor man is covered in sores and discolored
When the Bodhisattva saw this man, he turned to the charioteer and asked him the following, even though he already knew the answer
and he was breathing only with the greatest difficulty
As they followed the deceased, they pulled out their hair, threw dust on their heads, beat their chests, and lamented loudly
When he saw this, the Bodhisattva turned to the charioteer and asked him the following, even though he already knew the answer
The charioteer replied: “Your Highness, this man has died in Jambudvīpa
Never again shall he see his parents, wife, or children. He must abandon his possessions, his house, his friends, and his relatives
And proceed to the next world, where he shall never see his relatives again.
How sad that the life of a wise man does not last long
How sad that scholars are attached to pleasure
“Even if there were no old age, sickness, or death
The five aggregates would still be ridden with great suffering
What then about old age, sickness, and death, which always occur together? Well then! Turn around—I will think about how to be liberated from this state.
And so, monks, once again the Bodhisattva turned his fine chariot around and returned to the city
Monks, sometime later, while the Bodhisattva was setting out for the parks through the northern city gate
The Bodhisattva saw the mendicant and noticed that he was peaceful
He was self-controlled and restrained. He had pure conduct, and his eyes didn’t wander but looked down ahead at a distance of six feet. His behavior was beautiful and exquisite, as was the way he walked

When he said the letter kṣa, out came the statement: ‘Reaching the end of letters, all phenomena are ineffable (kṣara­paryantābhilāpya sarvadharma).’ 
Through the power of the Perfect Bodhisattva, Such words emerged from the instruments
As all these wanton women heard these words, they learned them, And directed their aspirations for awakening to the Perfect Being
“She should be young and beautiful, but without vanity; She should be loving like a sister
Thus, while the schoolmaster taught the children the alphabet, there emerged innumerable hundreds of thousands of excellent Dharma teachings due to the Bodhisattva’s power
Monks, while the Bodhisattva remained in this way among his retinue of consorts, he matured , women along with many hundreds of thousands of assembled gods for the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening
Fond of renunciation, she should be generous and disciplined toward priests and ascetics
You have ripened many gods and humans
they saw a child blazing with glory and splendor, and they thought, “Who is this seated here
“While acting in conformity with the world
Could it be Vaiśravaṇa, lord of wealth
You have acted in accordance with the world
In order to teach the retinue of consorts
After seeing the village, he entered a park at the edge of the fields
The Bodhisattva wandered around there in complete solitude
Could it be the mighty Kṛṣṇa, or perhaps the divine moon, or the thousand-rayed sun
Or is it Māra, lord of sense pleasures, or perhaps the lord of the mahoragas? Could it be Śakra, the vajra holder? Or is it perhaps Rudra, or the lord of kumbhāṇḍas
Or will it turn out to be a universal monarch?” Then they spoke the following verse
“This youth appears far more beautiful than Vaiśravaṇa
So is he Rāhu, an image of the vajra holder, the sun, or the moon
Or maybe he is an image of the supreme lord of sense pleasures, or Rudra, or Kṛṣṇa? Or perhaps he is a perfect Buddha, adorned with glorious physical signs?
When it was time for the Bodhisattva to leave home
Then the goddess of the grove addressed the sages with the following verse
“All the splendor of Vaiśravaṇa and the thousand-eyed one
All the splendor of the four guardians of the world and the lord of the demigods, All the splendor of Brahmā, lord of the world, and Kṛṣṇa, Is minuscule in comparison to that of the son of the Śākyas.
Once the sages heard the goddess’s words, they descended to the ground
There they saw the Bodhisattva practicing concentration, his body immovable and blazing with a mass of light
Reflecting on the Bodhisattva, they praised him with verses
One of the sages said
“In a world tormented by the fire of afflictions, This lake has appeared
He will discover the Dharma That will soothe beings.
Another sage said: “In a world benighted with ignorance, This torch has appeared
He will discover the Dharma That will illuminate beings.
Then the third sage remarked
He will discover the Dharma That will ferry beings across.
He will discover a Dharma That will free beings.
Finally the last sage said: “To those afflicted with old age and sickness, The best of doctors has come
He will discover a Dharma That frees from birth and death.
Once the sages had praised the Bodhisattva with these verses, they circumambulated him three times and returned to the sky
King Śuddhodana did not see the Bodhisattva. Displeased with his absence, he said
“Where has the child gone? I do not see him.
I have witnessed it firsthand. He will be victorious.” The Śākyas said
A great many people ran around  searching for the boy
Finally one of the ministers saw the Bodhisattva seated cross-legged, practicing concentration in the shade of a rose apple tree
“Your Majesty, look! This child is practicing concentration In the shade of the rose apple tree
He saw the Bodhisattva blazing with glory and splendo
King Śuddhodana went over to the rose apple tree
He, whom gods, nāga kings, gandharvas, and yakṣas revere, is in the park, concentrating
This wise, supreme man has a moon-like face with the beauty of a blooming lotus
Conceptions of permanence and impermanence
“It is the Śākya prince, descendant of the best of kings, who shines like the dawn
Dwelling in that grove was a goddess, who sang this verse to the sages
Monks, when the young child had grown a little older
There were also eight thousand goddesses, who were adorned with loose hanging jewelry and carried bhadraṃkara gems. They went ahead of the Bodhisattva, cleansing his way
“Even if this entire earth were filled with gold from Jambudvīpa, The light radiating from the pores of the Glorious Guide would outshine it
Then the sage stood up, joined his palms, and prostrated to the prince’s feet
Self and lack of self, pleasure and pain
I vanquished the three causal conceptions
“Here, through witnessing causality
His arches are high
I completely released All the fetters of existence Through the power of my knowledge
“Here, once I attained the threefold liberation
They had completed all the aspirations of the bodhisattvas
understood and realized all discriminating knowledges of the bodhisattvas, an
gained mastery over all the absorptions of the bodhisattvas
They enjoyed all the superknowledges of the bodhisattvas and had attained all the dhāraṇīs and all the confidence of the bodhisattvas
They had obtained all the powers of the bodhisattvas an
dwelt with all the patience of the bodhisattvas
Indeed each of them had completed all the bodhisattva grounds
At that time the Blessed One dwelt in the city of Śrāvastī
where he was revered by his fourfold retinue, as well as by kings, princes, royal ministers, vassal kings, and attendants. Likewise his followers among the military, the priests, the merchants, the householders, and the royal court revered him. Both city dwellers and those who lived in the countryside, as well as the adherents of extremist philosophies, ascetics, priests, logicians, and wandering hermits, also revered him. He was treated as their master and showed great respect. Presented with offerings
As the Blessed One’s fame spread throughout the world, he became known by various names and epithets, such as the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly and Completely Awakened One, He Who Is Both Wise and Virtuous, the Bliss-Gone One, the Knower of the World, the Peerless Guide Who Tames Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Men, and the Blessed Buddha
Endowed with the fivefold vision
the Blessed One taught the inhabitants of this and other worlds, each with its gods, Māra, Brahmā, monks, nuns, and priests. To all these beings, gods and humans alike, he taught what he himself had realized, and what he had thereby actualized and accomplished
Go before the Peaceful One, the One Who Is Liberated
the One Who Is Peerless in Illuminating the Dharma
Who dispels darkness and shows the sublime way With peaceful conduct and knowledge infinite in scope
With supreme devotion, go, all of you, Befor
From the mass of light that radiated from the Thus-Gone One, the following verses of exhortation arose
Come commune with the Sage, the Lion of the Śākyas. Sublime, supremely brilliant, and pure, The light of wisdom he radiates dispels darkness. Peaceful in form, his mind is virtuous and tranquil
An ocean of wisdom, with power both vast and pure
That night, just as people went to bed, the gods of the pure realm
Īśvara
Praśānta­vinīteśvara, and many other gods of the pure realms
With their brilliant colors, they illuminated the entirety of Jeta Grove with a divine light
This teaching illuminates the basic virtues of the bodhisattvas, showing how the Bodhisattva descended from the sublime palace in the Heaven of Joy, intentionally entered the womb, and sojourned in the womb
It shows the power of the place where he was born to a noble family, and how he surpassed others through all the superior special qualities that he demonstrated through his actions as a youth
eats of physical strength, and wrestling, demonstrating his superiority to all other beings in these areas
It explains the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the other innumerable qualities of a thus-gone one
Blessed One, please teach this now to benefit the multitude of beings. Teach it to bring them happiness. Teach it out of compassion for the world
to benefit a great multitude of beings, gods and humans alike
Out of compassion for these gods, and indeed for the entire world including the gods, the Blessed One remained silent, thereby offering his consent
Seeing that this silence indicated the Blessed One’s consent, the gods were overjoyed and content
they prostrated at his feet and circled him three times, scattering sandalwood powder, aloeswood powder, and māndārava flowers
Then they vanished
The Blessed One then continued to recount the events of the previous evening, up to the point where the gods disappeared
Bowing before the Blessed One with palms joined, the bodhisattvas and great listeners then made the following request
Comfortable and free from afflictions
There were millions of gods
Likewise he had perfected each and every quality of awakening: the applications of mindfulness, the thorough relinquishments, the bases of miraculous power, the faculties, the powers, the branches of awakening, and the path
Sublime signs and marks, indicating his boundless accumulation of merit and wisdom, beautifully adorned the body of the Bodhisattva
the applications of mindfulness, the thorough relinquishments
the precious quality of skillful means, and merit
The Bodhisattva was the great captain of the vessel of the Dharma, which he had perfectly accomplishe
light rays of knowledge radiated from the orb of his liberation and concentration, dispelling the light of the swarms of extremists, who are like fireflies
Having a stem of great compassion deeply rooted in the mind of awakening, this lotus was born of superior intention
there was no darkness within him; he perfectly embodied all that is wholesome
causing the lilies among humans and gods to bloom
The Great Bodhisattva was followed by a fourfold retinue, like the moon by the four continents, and he was endowed with the jewels of the seven branches of awakening
His acts of generosity were done well, as were his previous endeavors and his superior deeds
Ascertaining the basic virtues
perfect the forty kinds of liberation
and erect the forty kinds of right interest
Its enchanting, even grounds were covered with golden canopies and filled with various trees, such as mountain ebonies, campakas, trumpet vines, orchids, muchalindas, mahāmuchalindas, aśokas, banyans, persimmon trees, narras, karṇikāras, kesaras, sāls, and coral trees
In every direction there were flowered canopies, overflowing with jyotiṣ, mālikas, barasikas, taraṇīs, sumanas, bali, kotaranis, and other sweet-smelling flowers. Likewise there were danukari flowers, celestial flowers, blue lotuses, pink lotuses, water lilies, and white lotuses
eliminating pride, conceit, arrogance, aggression, rage, and anger, and bringing about happiness, well-being, joy, and mindfulness on a vast scale
The Bodhisattva dwelt comfortably in this great celestial palace
where a discourse on the genuine Dharma emerged amid a symphony of , musical instruments. From their sound, the following verses of inspiration arose, telling of the many virtuous deeds that the Bodhisattva carried out in times past
Rain down upon Jambudvīpa
Reach awakening through your austerities
Many gods of the realm of form, Who have transcended the realm of desire, Are all rejoicing in you, saying
You with sublime wisdom, you whose line is great indeed
Cast your gaze upon the great family with whom you will live. Observe the precious, exalted family among whom you will take birth,  For this is where you will manifest the conduct of a bodhisattva
Yet here at this grove, we are weak. Whose force dissolves our magical powers?
Even among gods we go unhindered, high above the realm of yakṣas and gandharvas
Like grasshoppers fallen into a forest fire
When he said the letter o, out came the statement: ‘The stream has been forded (oghottara)
When he said the letter ai, out came the statement: ‘The noble path is virtuous (airyāpathaḥ śreyāniti).
When he said the letter e, out came the statement: ‘Faults come from desire (eṣaṇā­samutthāna­doṣa).
“Here I have realized the nectar
When he said the letter ū, out came the statement: ‘The world is of little substance (ūnasattvaṃ jagat).
With the hairs on their bodies bristling with anger, they spoke the following verse
When he said the letter u, out came the statement: ‘The world is rife with misfortune (upa­drava­bahulaṃ jagat).
Right then five extremist sages
When he said the letter ī, out came the statement: ‘The world is riddled with plague (ītibahulaṃ jagat).
When he said the letter i, out came the statement: ‘The vast development of the senses (indriyavaipulya).
Which brings an end to old age, death, anguish, and pain For the benefit of the world
Undiscovered by any other exponent
When he said the letter ā, out came the statement: ‘Beneficial to self and others (ātmaparahita).
who had miraculous powers and the five superknowledges, were flying through the sky toward the north. Yet as they flew above this grove, they suddenly could not go any farther, and it felt as if they were being pushed back
“When he said the letter a, out came the statement: ‘Every composite phenomenon is impermanent (anityaḥ sarva­saṃ­skāraḥ).
Thus he settled into the fourth meditative concentration: perfectly pristine with impartiality and mindfulness, unconnected with pleasure or pain
the Sarva­sāra­saṃgrahaṇī script, or the Sarva­bhūta­ruta­grahaṇī script
He had already relinquished suffering and, as he now abandoned the feeling of comfort, both mental pleasure and displeasure vanished
“Once he awakens to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood, he will liberate many billions of beings, bringing them across the ocean of saṃsāra and establishing them in immortality
This is why, Great King, I cry and sigh so sadly
He had settled into the third meditative concentration, which is without joy: “impartial, aware, and abiding at ease,” as the noble ones describe it
As he was strolling through the park, he saw a beautiful and pleasant rose apple tree
and he decided to sit down cross-legged under its shade
Without any attachment to joy, he remained in equanimity with mindfulness and introspection and experienced physical pleasure. Aware and cognizant, he felt physically at ease
Seated there, the Bodhisattva attained a one-pointed state of mind
which is free of factors connected with evil deeds and nonvirtues
It is accompanied by thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and pleasure born of discernment
He then settled into the first meditative concentration
He then brought about the cessation of thoughts and analysis and became perfectly quiet
As his mind became concentrated, he settled into the second meditative concentration, which is free of thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and pleasure born of meditative absorption
Moreover, while the Bodhisattva was attending school
, children gave rise to thoughts aimed at unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening
This is the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva attended school, even though he was already so learned
Monks, on another occasion when the prince had grown a little older, he went with the sons of the ministers and some other boys to visit a farming village
He then brought about the cessation of thoughts and analysi
His power, gained from merit in millions of lives, is thwarting your miracles.
When the sages looked down below
fell to the feet of the Thus-Gone One and asked
Monks, on that occasion the earth gods then proclaimed and announced to the gods of the atmosphere
Once I attained the absorption of repulsiveness
Once I attained the absorption of wishlessness
Once I attained the absorption of emptiness
Once I attained the absorption of signlessness
“O King, the boy’s eyes lingered upon the daughter of Daṇḍapāṇi Śākya, the Śākya girl named Gopā, and there was a brief conversation between them.
And be as loving to the servants and maids as she is to herself. 
“Since he cuts the stream of all formations, he is not within the sphere of performance
He is called the one who is like the udumbara flower because it is so rare for him to appear and be seen
He is the one whose round face is gazed upon by all ministers and noble listeners
King, it is certain that they have come To see and worship the prince, the God of Gods.
he took off for the palace of King Śuddhodana surrounded by one million two hundred thousand gods, bathing the entire city of Kapilavastu in light
Right then, billions of overjoyed gods spoke to Chanda
“Chanda, bring him the excellent horse Kaṇṭhaka. Do not disappoint our guide
“Sage, behold the Golden One, worshiped by gods and humans.
At that time the great sage Asita, who had the five extraordinary powers, was residing on the slopes of Himavat, the king of mountains, together with his sister’s son Naradatta. When the Bodhisattva was born
Always acting for the benefit of the world—this is why you shine here today
“Sage! You shed tears, you cry
and you sigh deeply. What is wrong
Monks, the Bodhisattva then went to the home of the village girl Sujātā, where he sat down at the seat that had been prepared for him
On the other hand, if he were to leave his home and go forth as a renunciant, he would become a thus-gone one
Monks, the village girl Sujātā then filled a golden vessel with the milk porridge and honey and offered it to the Bodhisattva
renowned as the completely perfect Buddha, a peerless leader
The Bodhisattva then had this thought
Then the Bodhisattva had his meal. When he was done, he got up and asked Sujātā
“I don’t need this bowl.
When Sujātā had finished cooking the porridge, she placed it on the ground where, full of devotion, she had already prepared a seat for the Bodhisattva by scattering flowers and perfumed water
He will beget one thousand sons
Within the milk appeared the contours of an endless knot, a simple swastika, an elaborate swastika, a lotus, a vardhamāna, and other auspicious signs
Ever since the Bodhisattva had begun his practice of austerities, ten young girls from the village had served him as a way to see him, venerate him, and assist him
Monks, I realized that I should henceforth live on a single juniper berry and restrain myself from eating two
Foremost among them were the bodhisattva great being Maitreya
Chanda replied
the Blessed One entered a state of deep absorption known as the array of the Buddha’s adornments. The moment he entered into this state of absorption
the ray of light known as the light of wisdom‌ free from attachment that arouses the memory of the buddhas of times past shone forth from the protuberance on the crown of his head
“I must apply myself to eating even less than this.
“Take as your master the one with natural mastery of the Dharma
The sovereign of the Dharma, the all-knowing lord‌ of sages‌
He who has mastered those minds that are difficult to tame And whose own mind is free from the snares of Māra, For seeing him and hearing him is not without benefit
He is a friend of the Dharma and knows the ultimate
He is a peerless guide who illuminates the path.
visited the Blessed On
At dawn the next day, the Blessed One proceeded to a circular bamboo grove
Holding bows and arrows, swords, spears, and weapons
The people who lived in the villages surrounding the area where I was practicing began to say
They remained in the middle of the sky, keeping watch
Vinīteśvara, and many others.
The gods, who know the time of passing, Came joyfully before Queen Māyā. They held flowers as well as ointments; With folded hands, they paid homage
“Lion of Speech, your time is now
“Blessed One! Please grant us the teaching entitled The Play in Full
He then addressed the assembly
And dwelling evenly with one-pointed concentration, A group of gods arrived before me. “With great miraculous powers and brilliant colors, They were pristine, blazing with magnificence
Generate compassion and kindness for the entire world
Īśvara, Nanda, Praśāntacitta, Mahita, Sunanda, And a god called Śānta
Lord of Men, Pure Being, demonstrate passing away
“Oh my! The mendicant Gautama has turned black! Have you seen, he’s so dark! The mendicant Gautama has the color of the madgura fish! Previously his complexion was so beautiful, but now it has all changed.” Monks, at that point I thought to myself
Illuminating Jeta Grove with their splendor, They joyfully approached me
We pray that you grant the gift of the Dharma.
Including Maheśvara, Candana
“Oh my, the mendicant Gautama has turned black! Have you seen, he’s so dark! The mendicant Gautama has the color of the madgura fish! Previously his complexion was so beautiful, but now it has all changed.
There were eight million four hundred thousand goddesses from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings who approached the Bodhisattva, making offerings to him accompanied by music and singing
They joined their palms with respect And offered me this request
At that time the Bodhisattva had taken his seat on the Glorious Essence lion throne inside his great palace. This throne had come about through all his merit and was visible to all the gods and nāgas
Saying, ‘Oh! Behold the beauty of that human woman!
“Because of pride we thought That goddesses had the most attractive bodies
Yet when we saw the body of the king’s wife
We saw that her splendor outshines our divine bodies
“She will be the mother of the Supreme Being
Full of charms, she is like Rati herself
Just as a precious jewel rests within a fine vessel
This queen will be such a vessel for the god of gods
“From the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet, Her attractive limbs surpass the divine
When you look at her, your eyes will not be sated
And she will only thrill your heart and mind more and more
“Her attractive face and body Shine like the beautiful moon in the sky And blaze like the stainless fire of the sun
Her body shines with an excellent light
“The complexion of this queen is resplendent, Shining like the purest gold
the branches of awakening, the path, the perfection of knowledge
Her hair is soft, clean, and sweetly scented, Black like the excellent bee and arranged in braids
“Her eyes are like lotus petals
Her teeth are like stars in the sky
Her waist is curved like a bow and her hips are ample
gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and yakṣas, in their multitudes, rejoiced in his glory
Her shoulders are raised and her joints are smooth
“Her thighs and calves are like the trunk of an elephant
And her knees have a shapely form
At that time some gods from the pure realms had removed all the extremist practitioners, and now none of them were to be found
The palms of her hands and the soles of her feet are smooth and red
Surely she can only be a goddess.
Thus they examined her in many ways
Tossed flowers, and circumambulated her
Then, praising the renowned mother of the Victorious One
They instantly returned to the divine realm
The four guardians of the four directions
Śakra, the gods free from strife, the gods enjoying emanations, Other gods, demigods, kumbhāṇḍas, rākṣasas, Kiṃnaras, and mahoragas spoke
“Go before the Supreme Being
Its blossoming petals, illuminated by moonlight free from the torment of pride and arrogance, were pristine. Emitting the scent of discipline
study, and conscientious speech unhindered throughout the ten directions
Protect him, the best of men
Do not be hostile to beings
this lotus was foremost throughout the world in terms of knowledge,  yet untainted by the eight worldly concerns
Do no harm to any person.
As Queen Māyā resided in the palace
It radiated the sweet fragrance of the accumulation of merit and wisdom
They all assembled with their retinues
And is entreated to turn the wheel of the Dharma by a billion Brahmā gods
while the sunlight of knowledge and wisdom warmed it, causing the hundred petals of its pure vision to blossom
Throughout that time, we will make vast offerings to the Bliss-Gone One
the radiant majesty of his merit shone brightly among gods and humans. As the light of the moon
he taught what he himself had realized, and what he had thereby actualized and accomplished
And offered me this request
“ ‘To benefit all the worlds
This vast sūtra, this great discourse, Was taught by all the victorious ones of times past
Today as well, O Sage, since you have dispelled attachment
“ ‘Consider the assembly of bodhisattvas
Defeat opponents and tame all demons
By teaching us this supreme Great Vehicle
“The assembly of gods thus offered their request
And with my silence, I indicated my consent
This brought them joy and satisfaction
And with delight they scattered flower petals
“Thus listen here, monks, to this vast sūtra
Taught in times past by all the thus-gone ones For the welfare of all the worlds
Listen, one and all, to this great discourse.
This concludes the first chapter, on the setting
Now, monks, what is this extensive discourse on the Dharma known as The Play in Full
Filled with all the precious teachings, including that of dependent origination, so profound and difficult to fathom
He sought out all basic virtues and had formed positive habitual tendencies
Recall the prophecy of Dīpaṃkara
“With a mind free from the vast range of impurities
While your virtuous heart is at once pristine and free from fault
Bring to mind your generous deeds of times past
“You have cultivated tranquility and discipline
Bring to mind all the deeds you engaged in over billions of eons
Remember, do not forget, you who are of infinite renown
You who know the way of death and passing away, take rebirth
“Even enjoying pleasurable things for thousands of eons Will not satisfy them, just as saltwater will not slake one’s thirst
Now that you yourself are sated, be kind; Please satisfy those who have thirsted for so long
“While he tames trillions of beings for the deathless state
“Are you not one of untarnished reputation Who takes delight in the Dharma, not desire
Performing enlightened activity in the trichiliocosm
And until he passes into cool and peaceful nirvāṇa
And furthermore your eyes are unblemished, So now please look with compassion upon the world with its gods
For that long, none of us will abandon the greatly renowned sage.
“Were the millions of gods not satisfied Upon hearing the Dharma from you
“With your mighty, unblemished gaze, have you not observed The buddhas throughout the ten directions of the world
“Immortal lords, please listen to these words That express what is on our minds
Listening to them as they teach the Dharma? Please therefore reveal this supreme Dharma to the world
We give up our sensual enjoyments and the perfect bliss of concentration In order to serve this sublime pure being
“Glorious One, do you not adorn the palace in the Heaven of Joy With the splendor of your merit? So please, with the heart of compassion
“As he enters the womb, abides in the womb, and is born
Please send down a shower of nectar And soothe the afflictions of gods and humans
We will make offerings to the Great Being, so worthy of worship
“Like a skilled doctor who knows the constitutions of his patients, You dispense medicine to those who are chronically ill
We shall protect the Sage, who is well guarded by merit
No one shall cause him any problems through a hostile mind
Let forth the lion’s roar of the buddhas
Striking fear into the hearts of the jackal-like extremists
“In songs and with the melodious sounds of cymbals
We will praise the qualities of the one with an ocean of qualities
Now you must defeat Māra, Touching the earth with the perfect palm of your hand
Whoever hears this will engender the excellent mind of awakening And thus delight all gods and humans
“The four guardians of the world are present, Waiting to offer you an alms bowl
Śakra, Brahmā, and millions of others are present as well, Waiting to receive you when you take birth
“We shall fill the king’s palace with flower petals And light the finest incense of black aloe
With that aroma, gods and humans will become very content
“When a precious jewel is placed in the right vessel, It makes the jewel even more glorious. Likewise let your pristine mind, like a precious jewel
It will free them from sickness and fever and make them happy
Exhorting the Compassionate One with the words: “The time is now—do not let it slip away!
“We will fill the entire city of Kapilavastu With blossoms of māndārava flowers, beautiful jasmine, and hibiscus, In order to make offerings to him, Who appears due to virtuous activities
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva was exhorted that the time for the Dharma had come
“As long as he is in his mother’s womb, untainted by the three stains
Rain down upon the victory banner of Jambudvīpa.” Thus did the melodious sounds Of many verses such as these spring forth
Our wish is to make offerings to the great intelligent one
He was joined in the palace by a group of gods whose good fortune equaled that of the Bodhisattva, and who had entered the same vehicle
Bodhisattvas with similar conduct to the Bodhisattva gathered from throughout the ten directions
The Bodhisattva then said, “Monks, in twelve years the Bodhisattva shall enter the womb of his mother.” At that time the gods from the pure realms ventured to Jambudvīpa
“Whoever wishes for the wisdom of learners, masters, and solitary buddhas, As well as the wisdom of omniscience
And hopes to roar like a lion through the ten powers
Let him follow the learned one with an ocean of qualities
“When the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class wishes to examine the precious horse, he will mount it at daybreak and travel throughout this great earth, which is surrounded by oceans
the precious steward’s divine sight will enable him to perceive treasures—both those that are owned and those that are not—in the surrounding area for up to an entire league
“How is it that the universal monarch appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious minister
The universal monarch merely has to think of commissioning an army and it is done
Let him follow the One Who Has Completed All Paths
“If, however, he leaves his family behind and becomes a monk, he will become a buddha
With these words, the gods inspired the priests to recite the Vedas
In this manner the universal monarch comes to possess the precious minister
In a similar manner, other gods arrived in Jambudvīpa to exhort the solitary buddhas. “Noble ones,” they said. “Give up this buddha realm
Let him follow this pure being
And why, monks, did the Bodhisattva examine the country of his birth
And why, monks, did the Bodhisattva examine the family of his birth
When the priestly families are dominant in the world, the bodhisattva is born into a priestly family
When the ruling-class families are dominant in the world, the bodhisattva is born into a ruling-class family
Let him quickly follow the king of physicians
They have no Dharma practice
Let him follow the learned one who masters disciplined conduct.
To this the response came, “This is not a worthy place, for these people are malicious and violent
Some said, “The city of Mathurā is rich, prosperous, and happy
“Whoever lives in these divine palace
“This is not a worthy place,” others replied. “This king was born into a family with wrong views
And wishes to enjoy the divine pleasures Of the goddesses and the divine delights, Let him serve the one with a face like an immaculate moon
“This is not appropriate,” others replied. “King Sumitra does indeed have these qualities. Yet he is extremely aged, so he does not even possess the ability to produce a son
Let him serve the immaculate brilliant one
“Whoever wishes to frolic together with goddesses In a splendid chariot, or in the pleasure groves Carpeted with petals of māndārava flowers
Let him serve this great being
“Whoever aspires to be the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife Or to be the lord of the Heaven of Joy, Someone worthy of worship by all beings
Mindfulness of sensations is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Let him serve the one of unlimited renown
In each of King Śuddhodana’s lotus ponds and reservoirs, there appeared lotuses the size of cartwheels, each with many trillions of petals
Mindfulness of the mind is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
“Whoever desires to enjoy himself in a beautiful mansion In the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations And wants to enjoy all the mentally created illusions
In all of King Śuddhodana’s delightful parks, woodlands, and gardens, the various trees blossomed and carried fruits of all seasons
Mindfulness of phenomena is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
In that sublime residence of King Śuddhodana, all the provisions of butter, sesame oil, honey, raw sugar, and sugar-cane juice were never depleted and appeared to be full even though they were used abundantly
Let him serve this one possessing excellent qualities
Inside the women’s quarters of King Śuddhodana’s excellent residence, all the instruments, such as the great kettledrums, the clay and wooden kettledrums, the flutes, lutes, reed pipes, three-stringed lutes, bells, and cymbals suddenly emitted wonderful music by themselves without being played
In that most excellent residence of King Śuddhodana, all the containers of different types of precious substances, such as gold, silver, jewels, pearls, beryl, shells, crystals, and corals, opened their lids and displayed their flawless perfection and abundance
“Whoever is a master over demons, but whose mind has no hatred
The four thorough relinquishments are gateways to the light of the Dharma

Who is the master of his senses and has surpassed others, Let him go with this benefactor
The four bases of miraculous power are gateways to the light of the Dharma
“Similarly whoever wishes to pass beyond the desire realm And reside in the realm of Brahmā

“Your Majesty, master of the earth, good lord, I pray that you hear me
The faculty of knowledge is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Your Highness, please grant me a favor

But other gods suggested, “In the form of Śakra
Your Majesty, I will not act immorally
I will remain truthful, not slander others, and abandon harsh words; I will never use idle or nonvirtuous words
When the king heard this speech, he rejoiced and proclaimed: “Let everything you wish come to pass
I will act properly and renounce flattery, hypocrisy, and envy
It should ooze fragrant fluids from its temples and have a glorious body
“I am joyfully engaged in strict disciplined conduct
So, sovereign master of men, do not act lustfully because of attraction to me
Your Majesty, may nonvirtue not arise in you for a long time
Whatever you seek and wish, That request I shall grant you.
Inside the cool pavilion at the top of the palace where the swans roost
Decorate them with beautiful flowers and use the best incense and perfume; Adorn them with parasols, banners, and rows of palms trees
“Place on guard twenty thousand brave fighting men in armor
Brandishing swords, arrows, spears, and lances
Someone who is learned in the Vedas and scriptures of the priests will then recognize such features and use them to predict the arrival of a person endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man.
Monks, while the Bodhisattva was still residing in the sublime Heaven of Joy, he considered the time for his birth. At that time he manifested eight omens at the sublime residence of King Śuddhodana
What were these eight
Bathed, perfumed, well dressed, and with her arms bejeweled
Surrounded by her female attendants, like a goddess
Accompanied by the pleasant sounds of thousands of cymbals, The queen ascended and rested like a divine maiden
The legs of her bed were embellished with costly divine jewels
It was a pleasing bed bestrewn with flowers. There she unfastened her tiara of precious jewels, Like a goddess in the Miśraka Garden
The fruition of that practice of giving Is that those in the world of pretas obtain food and drink
“In the past, for billions of eons, You preserved unbroken, uncorrupted discipline
By the fruition of the practice of that discipline
Those in the lower realms without all the freedoms are purified
“In the past, for billions of eons, You cultivated patience as the basis for attaining awakening
“In the past, for billions of eons, You cultivated supreme and unwavering diligence
“The entire realm of the Heaven of Joy is gloomy
Hearing these words, the king instantly summoned the priests Who were experts in the Vedas and their treatises
The queen replied
How is it that a universal monarch comes to possess the precious wheel
Such a wheel can only belong to a king who has been properly consecrated by sprinkling his head. On the fifteenth day of the lunar month, while observing a poṣadha fast, the king will first wash his head and then go to the top terrace of the palace, surrounded by the women of the female quarters
the king, who is appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class
As he sees it, he will think to himself
I have heard that if a precious, divine wheel appears from the east when a king, who has been appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class, ascends to the top floor of the palace surrounded by a gathering of women while observing a poṣadha fast on the fifteenth day of the lunar month
then he shall become a universal monarch
Since I can now clearly perceive this precious, divine wheel, I must certainly be a universal monarch
Turning the precious, divine wheel with his right hand, he will proclaim, ‘Precious wheel, noble and divine, please turn in harmony with the Dharma, rather than that which is not the Dharma
As he travels, the provincial kings of the eastern lands will come to greet him, carrying silver vessels filled with gold dust, and gold vessels filled with fragments of silver. ‘Welcome, lord,’ they will say. ‘Please come
This kingdom is yours. It is extremely vast and prosperous
Likewise you should refrain from telling lies, sowing discord, speaking harshly, and talking frivolously
When the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class wishes to examine the precious elephant
he will mount it at daybreak and travel throughout this great earth, which is surrounded by oceans
After returning to the royal palace, he will fondly resume his governance
In this manner the universal monarch comes to possess the precious horse
The precious jewel of the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class appears just as before
then, at midnight, in complete darkness, he will affix it to the tip of a victory banner an
venture out in the gardens  to observe the sublime grounds
The light emitted by the precious jewel will illuminate the surrounding area for an entire league, including all four divisions of the king’s army
Monks, at that time there was a solitary buddha named Mātaṅga who dwelt on Mount Golāṅgula­parivartana in the city of Rājagṛha
and when birth, old age, sickness, and death have become known that a bodhisattva enters his mother’s womb
Because a bodhisattva is not born in an outlying continent, nor is he born on the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha, on the western continent of Aparagodānīya, or on the northern continent of Uttarakuru. Rather a bodhisattva is born on the southern continent of Jambudvīpa
For this reason, the Bodhisattva engaged in these four great examinations as he dwelt in the supreme realm of the Heaven of Joy
This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived
This is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived,” others responded
for the mother’s family is not pure, nor is the father’s
Hence this is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to take birth
Some said, “The Kośala family has a large retinue, many mounts, and great wealth
The king is a nihilist. Hence this is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to take birth, either
Some suggested, “The city of Vaiśālī is wealthy, prosperous, and happy
Hence this city is not worthy of the Bodhisattva, either
Others said, “The Pradyota family in the city of Ujjayinī has a great army and many mounts
In this manner the bodhisattvas and gods observed all the illustrious royal families to be found throughout the sixteen kingdoms of Jambudvīpa,  and found them all to be inadequate
As they considered this
a god named Jñānaketudhvaja, who was firmly established in the Great Vehicle and could not be turned away from awakening, spoke to the great assembly of gods and bodhisattvas
It must be powerful, and renowned as such
They must respect their fathers, mothers, mendicants, and priests
It must be descended from a noble family, a family of bodhisattvas
Indeed this family must be irreproachable when it comes to any accusations of faults related to one’s birth, such as those found in this entire world with its gods, demons, and brahmās, mendicants and priests
What are these thirty-two qualities
A bodhisattva in his final existence must be conceived in the womb of a woman known by all and steadfast in conduct
She must come from a good caste and a good family
She must have an excellent figure, an excellent name, and excellent proportions
She must not have given birth previously, and she must have excellent discipline
the Bodhisattva will be conceived in the womb of a mother who is observing the poṣadha fast
The bodhisattvas and gods, having heard the Bodhisattva explain the attributes of the pure family and the pure mother, thought to themselves
He is kind and handsome, neither too old nor too young. He has a fine body and every excellent quality
He is knowledgeable concerning crafts, astrology, the self, the Dharma, the truth, the world, and signs
with words that are soft, gentle, dependable, and altogether beyond reproach. Her voice is like that of the cuckoo; she is demure and speaks only sweet and pleasant words
she speaks with sincerity, her words measured and pleasing to the ear
She is quick to learn, honest and straightforward, free from guile, artifice, and deceit. She is modest and decent, constant and dependable
Like a celestial maiden in the garden of Indra, Māyādevī lives in King Śuddhodana’s female quarters. She is fit to be the mother of the Bodhisattva. Thus it appears that the purity of the family described by the Bodhisattva can be seen only in the Śākya clan
On this topic, it is said
In the Dharmoccaya Palace, the Pure Being Sat upon the lion throne called Sublime Dharma
She is aptly named Māyādevī, ‘Magically Emanated Goddess.
Her body is as beautiful as a celestial maiden, With a shapely silhouette and perfectly formed limbs
he dwelt in the Heaven of Joy in Uccadhvaja, a great celestial palace measuring sixty-four leagues around, where he taught the Dharma to the gods of the Heaven of Joy
the throne was covered with colorful and fragrant flowers. It was magnificent indeed, glittering with the light of many hundreds of thousands of precious jewels
Look upon them, countless, innumerable, and incalculable such as they are
Then, through the blessings of the Bodhisattva, the entire assembly of gods saw all these bodhisattvas
What are these  gateways? They are as follows
Faith, my friends, is a gateway to the light of Dharma, for with it one’s mind is unshakable
for it enables one to relinquish the dark fog of ignorance and stupidity, to abandon incorrect views, and to ripen sentient beings with incorrect knowledge
for it leads one to be conceived in the womb, to be born, to manifest in the world, to undergo austerities
So listen now to learn about these actions. “Acknowledge the kindness done to you
Goddesses, companions, and beautiful songs Are like the audience of a play
They are like a crowd of people who assemble And then go their own separate ways
And besides, the karma that results from good deeds Also binds one, and ever follows behind one’s back
Investigate suffering, impermanence, and lack of self; Examine these three phenomena thoroughly. They occur in connection to causes and conditions; They are void of life and have no owner
Exert yourself with continuous concentration. When acting, one takes the opportunity; Without acting, one does not accomplish anything
or a gandharva, or a kiṃnara, or a mahoraga, or Maheśvara
or the moon god, or the sun god, or a garuḍa
There was also one of the gods of the Brahmā realm present, who was called Ugratejā. Having been a sage in his previous life, he had taken rebirth among the gods, where he had become irreversible from unexcelled and perfect awakening. He now spoke
The priests’ mantras and the treatises of the Vedas mention the proper form for a bodhisattva to take when descending into the womb of his mother
It should be in the form of an excellent, great elephant with six tusks, covered with golden netting
The residence was immaculate since all weeds, stumps, brambles, small pebbles, and gravel had been removed
It was  well watered and very clean
It was undisturbed by wind and free from soot and dust
There were no mosquitoes, flies, bees, or snakes. It was covered with flowers, and the area became level, like the palm of a hand
Flocks of birds came to the palace from the Himālayan mountains, the king of mountain ranges. There were pattraguptas, parrots, mynas, cuckoos, swans, curlews, peacocks, wild geese, painted snipes, nightingales, pheasants, and many others. The birds had beautiful and delightful wings in many colors and sang in melodious sounds
They perched upon the verandas, turrets, doorways, pavilions, and upper terraces of King Śuddhodana’s sublime residence
The birds were joyful and content, and they each sang happily
Lord, out of compassion for all beings, I will adopt the eight precepts, Which include disciplined and moral conduct, as well as fasting
May no persecution, beating, or malicious threats take place. May there be no royal retribution or unjust punishment
Let them guard the quarters where the swans call out melodiously; Let them guard the queen with loving care so that she is not afraid
Śakra, lord of the gods; and the gods of Suyāma, Santuṣita, Sunirmita, and Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin. There were also Sārthavāha, the officer son of Māra; Brahmā, the lord of the Sahā World; the divine priest Brahmottara; the divine priest Subrahmā; and Prabhāvyūha, Ābhāsvara, Maheśvara, and the gods living in the pure realms of Niṣṭhāgata and the Highest Heaven, as well as many hundreds of thousands of others as well
without expressing our gratitude to him, it would be inappropriate
as he is in the womb
when he is in the female quarters watching the musical performances
as he proceeds to the seat of awakening, tames the demons, attains perfect and complete awakening, and turns the wheel of the Dharma
Whoever wishes to enjoy the charming Miśraka Garden, With the celestial palace, the birthplace of the gods, Full of golden-hued flowers
Let him serve today the great being Resplendent with the four immeasurables
Whoever longs to take birth among humans In the vast realm of a supreme universal monarch
Whoever wants to be a ruler or the son of a wealthy merchant, Rich and happy with great wealth, Surrounded by an army able to conquer enemies
Let him go with this benefactor
Whoever desires beauty, luxuries, and power, And wishes for fame, courage, and good qualities, And would like to speak agreeably with words that are heeded
Whoever desires the divine and human enjoyments, Or all the happiness of the three realms of existence, Or the bliss of concentration and the happiness in solitude
Whoever yearns to abandon attachment and anger, And wants to clear away the darkness of the afflictions
Let him, with his mind calm, tranquil, and totally at peace, Quickly follow the One Who Has Tamed His Mind
Whoever desires to close the path to the lower realms, And open the path to the fortune of deathlessness, And travel on the eightfold path
Whoever wishes to make offerings to the Thus-Gone One, And listen to the Dharma from that lord of compassion, And attain the qualities of the saṅgha
Let him follow this ocean of qualities
Whoever hopes to exhaust the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death, And be free from the shackles of cyclic existence, And enjoy purity equal to limitless space
The learned one who wishes for Discipline, absorption, and knowledge, Who wants liberation that is profound, hard to see, and difficult to fathom
Whoever desires many such qualities, And the happiness of existence as well as nirvāṇa, And wants to utterly perfect all qualities
When they heard these verses
There were , gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, , gods from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
And until he is born in order to bring an end to aging and death, We will serve him devotedly
hovering in midsky, they sang these verses to one another
Stretched our hands and pointed out Queen Māyā resting in her bed
We beauties with revealing garment
Bearing aloft flowers as well as ointments, We bowed with folded hands
came from all ten directions within the sacred abode of the Heaven of Joy, also approaching the Bodhisattva in order to make offerings to him
Similarly, eight million four hundred thousand goddesses from each of the realms of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the Heaven Free from Strife,  the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanation
approached the Bodhisattva. Singing songs and playing musical instruments of all types, they made offerings to the Bodhisattva
Monks, as the Bodhisattva was about to pass away and take rebirth, many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas, who were bound by just one more birth
Monks, as he started to move, the Bodhisattva’s body began to shine with a brilliant and dazzling light that surpassed any other celestial light. This unprecedented light illuminated all the vast and enormous realms of the great trichiliocosm
Even the darkest regions of the world, filled with negativity and obscurity, where even the renowned great power and magical ability of the sun and the moon are unable to produce light, colors, or heat, were bathed in light. In those realms, the unfortunate beings normally cannot even see their own hands. But even there, the dazzling light shone
Due to the light, the beings in those realms now recognized one another and remarked
Listen, friends! Other beings have also been born here
The world shook so violently that its center and edge, east and west, as well as north and south, all bounced around, so that when one side was up, the other was down
agreeable sounds that do not produce fear
At that moment there was not a single being anywhere that felt hostile, frightened, or anxious
At that moment even the light of the sun and moon and the splendor of the gods, such as Śakra, Brahmā, and the world protectors, was eclipsed
All beings who were living in the hells, along with those born as animals and all those in the realm of the lord of death
became instantaneously free from suffering and filled with every happiness
No being had any painful emotion, such as anger, delusion, envy, jealousy, pride, hypocrisy, arrogance, wrath, malice, or burning anguish
At that moment all sentient being
felt love for each other, wished each other well
Hundreds of thousands of goddesses each sang songs
From all around they praised the Bodhisattva with the sounds of their tunes
This perfect son of hers will outshine The three worlds with his splendor
Monks, the cold season had passed and it was the third month of spring
On the fifteenth day, during the full moon, while his future mother was observing the poṣadha precepts during the constellation of Puṣya, the Bodhisattva moved, fully conscious and aware, from the fine realm of the Heaven of Joy to the womb of his mother
in the form of a baby elephant, white in color with six tusks
He entered through his mother’s right sid
As he entered, he stayed only at the right side of the womb and never on the left
He pleased the priests by offering them delicious food and drink. When they were all full, he entertained them and presented them with gifts before they departed
O Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One has taught how the female body is inferior and enjoys desire. That was astonishing. But
you, who are superior to all worlds
it is even more astonishing tha
Blessed One, you have mentioned how it all happened, and yet it is simply beyond me
where they prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One and circled him three times
These gods further embellished the jeweled structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva
using divine fabrics, garlands, perfumes, flowers, music, and other divine delights
The most eminent among the gods all surrounded the structure
At the same time Śakra, lord of the gods, was standing far away on top of Mount Sumeru in the middle of the ocean
Shielding his face with his palm, he turned his head and stared out unblinking and completely transfixed, but he was unable to see the jeweled structure
and the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the Heaven Free from Strife, the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations are inferior in comparison to them
“Friends,” replied Śakra, “wait until the best of the superior gods come into the presence of the Blessed One and delight him.
Thus they stood aside, turned their heads, and gazed intently at the Blessed One
The jeweled structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva was finely shaped, exquisite and beautiful to behold
It was square in form and had four pillars
There is nothing whatsoever in the world, including the realms of gods and Brahma gods, that is similar in color and shape to the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva
Only the best of charioteers and the great Brahmā, who is master of a thousand powers, were able to see that flower
To everyone else, it was invisible
In that great lotus appeared a drop of nectar, which embodied the extracted essence and vitality of the entire great trichiliocosm
Apart from a bodhisattva in his final existence, who has completed all the bodhisattva stages
no other being is able to digest such a drop of vital energy
He always offered the finest flowers, the best fruits, and the most delicious foods first to the thus-gone ones, the memorials of the thus-gone ones, the saṅgha of hearers of the thus-gone ones, and his parents
In this way the temple that delighted the Bodhisattva was completely perfect and finely constructed both inside and outside
It was also pleasant to touch, like silk from Kaliṅga
This is merely an example, for in reality nothing could compare to it
Because of the previous aspirations of the Bodhisattva, his intentions were accomplished
Śakra, lord of the gods, as well as the four great kings, the twenty-eight great commanders of the yakṣas, and the master of the guhyakas, who are the type of yakṣa from which Vajrapāṇi came
all knew that the Bodhisattva had entered the womb of his mother, and they constantly stayed close to him
The Bodhisattva also had four goddesses named Utkhalī, Samutkhalī, Dhvajavatī, and Prabhāvatī serve him
so the Bodhisattva dwelling in his mother’s womb also illuminated the innermost chamber of the precious temple through his splendor, brilliance, and color
When that was illuminated, he illuminated the middle chamber of the fragrant temple
When the second level  of the fragrant temple was illuminated, the light went farther and illuminated the outer chamber of the fragrant temple
Then, as the third level of the fragrant temple was bathed in light, his mother’s entire body became filled with light
The light then went farther and illuminated the seat upon which his mother was seated
Gradually the light streamed forth and brightened the entire palace
The light rays rose beyond the palace and illuminated the east
They perceived the Bodhisattva, who was in the womb of his mother, in the form of a child who has already taken birth, extending his hand and moving it in various positions
Upon seeing this they prostrated to the Bodhisattva and were filled with joy, devotion, and well-being
When the Bodhisattva saw that they were settled
he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed them, inspired them, and delighted them
When they wished to go
the Bodhisattva, who knew full well their thoughts, extended his right hand as a farewell greeting
This was the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva, in the quiet of the night, would extend his right hand and draw it back. Finally he would let the hand rest while maintaining mindfulness and carefulness
Monks, at that moment Śakra, lord of the gods, was unable to resist the Bodhisattva’s request, and s
he and the gods all settled down on the seats that had been arranged for them
Then Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, and those gods of the pure realms reflected, “We have been dismissed by the Bodhisattva.
Then they circled around the Bodhisattva and his mother three times before departing
When he knew that they were settled, the Bodhisattva questioned and examined the bodhisattvas  regarding the divisions pertaining to the Great Vehicle
However, with the exception of the gods who were of equal fortune, no one else perceived this
On the contrary she felt light, supple, and happy, and she did not experience any uncomfortable pains in her belly
She neither experienced nor witnessed any heat, cold, hunger, thirst, gloom, uncleanliness, or fatigue
No unpleasant forms, sounds, smells, tastes, or textures appeared to her, and she also had no bad dreams
All those who had been struck by illness were freed from their disease as soon as the mother of the Bodhisattva placed her right hand on the top of their head
those who suffered from any illness or ailment that arises from disharmony among wind, bile, or phlegm
illnesses related to the eyes,  ears, nose, tongue, and lips, as well as toothaches, throat diseases, goiters, lumps, various forms of leprosy, tuberculosis, madness, dementia, fevers, swellings, boils, rashes, scabs, and other illnesses
these people could then return to their homes
When Queen Māyā looked inside her belly, she saw the Bodhisattva resting on the right side of her womb
She could see this as clearly as if she was looking at her own face in a spotless mirror
Monks, through the blessings of the Bodhisattva staying in his mother’s womb
the sounds of divine musical instruments arose constantly without interruption both day and night, and a rain of divine flowers fell
The kingdom was joyful and the harvests were bountiful. There were no disturbances or animosity anywhere
With great delight, he followed the Dharma
The Blessed One then showed the jeweled structure to venerable Ānanda as well as to Śakra, lord of the gods; the four guardians of the world; and many other gods and humans
As they saw the structure, they were satisfied, uplifted, and full of rejoicing. In a joyful mood, they were happy and delighted
She saw the Bodhisattva in her womb. Like the moon in the sky encircled by stars
The king of the Śākyas observed the mending and purification ritual; Leaving his royal duties, he only practiced the Dharma
This concludes the sixth chapter, on entering the womb
Monks, in this way ten months passed, and the time came for the Bodhisattva to take birth
Quick, gather twenty thousand brave men, Heroes who long for the battlefield and combat. Let them brandish sharp weapons—bows and arrows, swords, spears, and lasso
To carefully guard Māyādevī and her retinue
The king himself decorated the chariot, And a thousand gods prepared a divine throne
The four guardians of the world led the supreme chariot
Śakra himself, lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, cleared its path
None of the gods, nor the nāgas, Śakra, Brahmā, or the guardians of the world, Nor any other being in the trichiliocosm could accept such offerings as these
Some , celestial maidens followed her, as did , nāga maidens, , gandharva maidens, , kiṃnara maidens, and , female demigods. All of them were lavishly ornamented and sang her praise in melodic voices accompanied by music
All of Lumbinī Grove was sprinkled with droplets of perfumed water and strewn with celestial flowers
Then the great nāga kings Nanda and Upananda revealed their upper bodies in the sky an
produced two streams of cool and warm water to rinse the Bodhisattva’s body
At that time the Bodhisattva, with unhindered higher knowledge, which he manifested due to the ripening of previous roots of virtue
saw the entire great trichiliocosm. He saw all the cities, towns, estates, kingdoms, royal cities, and lands, as well as all gods and humans
He saw all the cities, towns, estates, kingdoms, royal cities, and lands, as well as all gods and humans
He also perfectly knew the minds of all sentient beings an
carefully surveyed them, looking to see if there was anyone similar to himself in terms of virtuous conduct, discipline, meditative absorption, or knowledge
Next he took seven steps toward the west and
pausing on the seventh step
“I am the Supreme Being  on this earth. This is my last birth, where I shall uproot birth, old age, sickness, and death!
he proclaimed these satisfying words in lion-like fashion
I will cause great rain clouds of the Dharma to shower down on all hell beings, extinguishing the fires of hell an
filling the beings there with happiness
Next he took seven steps downhill, saying
From the expanse of pure space, the sound of thunder rang out
and from the cloudless sky
a fine mist of rain showered down ever so gently, mixed with divinely colored flowers, cloths, ornaments, and powdered incense
All the light of the sun, the moon, Brahmā, Śakra, and the guardians of the world  was eclipse
by an otherworldly light of a hundred thousand colors
dislike, dejection, fear, greed, jealousy, and stinginess subsided, an
everyone abandoned all forms of unwholesome conduct
A rain of flowers, powders, incense, garlands, jewels, ornaments, and cloths showered down from innumerable clouds
In short, when the Bodhisattva, who is more exalted than anyone in all the worlds, came into this world
many inconceivable events took place
The Blessed One responded to these words from Ānanda by proclaiming
In the future there will be some monks who do not train their bodies and minds and do not acquaint themselves with discipline and knowledge
wild, arrogant, unrestrained, distracted, hesitant, doubting, and without trust
They will bring stains on the monastic order and not live like proper monks
When they hear about the Bodhisattva entering his mother’s womb in such a pure way
they will not believe it. Instead they will gather and gossip, saying
We are just human beings, so we are not able to achieve that state
Ānanda, these foolish beings will be overcome with desire for wealth, respect, and praise
They will sink into filth and be overcome with their lust for honor
“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One
the behavior of such people will not be proper, but base
Ānanda, through their improper conduct, these beings will fall into the great hell of incessant pain
Why is this
Ānanda, there are some monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who do not feel inspired when they hear sūtras like this one. Instead they do not trust these sūtras and they reject them
As soon as they die, they will all fall into the great Hell of Ultimate Torment
They will reach a place of supreme joy and genuinely take refuge
As appropriate objects for others’ generosity, they are worthy recipients of offerings
Why is that
It is because they have faith in the teachings of the thus-gone ones, which go against all worldly conventions
Because, Ānanda, some beings are pleased and delighted to hear me, but not to see me
They are also my friends
Think like this, and your wishes will be fulfilled
And because those friends of the Thus-Gone One speak genuinely and tell no lies
I entrust those friends of the Thus-Gone One to those who speak the truth—the future thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the completely perfect buddhas
On this topic, it is said
Glowing with virtuous, stainless, pure golden light, resplendent like the sun and moon
At that time sixty thousand goddesses with melodious voices
The Lion-like Being, with disciplined conduct, emerged from Māyādevī’s right side
Like a golden mountain, glowing with purity, the Guide was born
The trichiliocosm, with all its animate and inanimate contents, shook
As dazzling light streamed forth, even the lower realms were pacified
Wherever he placed his feet on the ground, A beautiful lotus
Twenty thousand kings from the borderlands Came before the king, saying, “O King, may you be victorious! We have come
Now tell us, king, what shall we do
Your Majesty, you are the master and we are the subjects. King, may victory be yours
Monks, for seven days following the Bodhisattva’s birth, he was honored with celestial and human music, respected, revered, and given various offerings in the Lumbinī Grove
Food, drink, and enjoyments were proffered
As the lower realms are pacified, As all beings feel joy, He Who Will Establish Beings in Happiness, The Bringer of Joy, has been born
As the unclouded lights Of the gods, the sun, and the moon Are outshone and disappear
since she had reached the maximum extent of her lifespan
And why is that
Because once a bodhisattva is born and has grown up, it would destroy his mother’s heart if he were to renounce his home
They were preceded by five thousand maidens holding various fresh garlands of wildflowers, as well as five thousand maidens carrying various boxes
Twenty thousand celestial maidens with ornate jewelry held up jewel garlands and guided the chariot
Between every two of the celestial maidens was a human maiden, and between every two human maidens was a celestial maiden
However, because of the power of the Bodhisattva, the celestial girls did not find the smell of the human girls displeasing
they stood in front of these house
with their hands folded. Bowing reverentially, they invited the Bodhisattva
Then the eldest of the elders of the Śākya clan gathered to discus
who among their women should be responsible for the upbringing, care, and nurturing of the Bodhisattva. They agreed that it should be a skilled and kind person who could care for him in a loving and altruistic atmosphere
he saw many amazing miraculous displays and he perceived many gods who joyfully hovered in the sky, waving banners and calling out, “Buddha!
Witnessing this, he thought to himself, “Excellent! I must see this!
who will all be heroic, brave, handsome, and triumphant
By his innate strength, he will subdue and conquer the entire world and its oceans without using force or weapons, and in a way that accords with the doctrine
Just like the king of swans, the great sage Asita, accompanied by his nephew Naradatta, soared through the sky to the city of Kapilavastu
The gatekeeper went before King Śuddhodana with folded hands and said
“Your Majesty! There is an old, elderly, and decrepit sage at the gate, who says that he wishes to see the king.
He then very respectfully seated him on a cushion. Once he saw that the sage was sitting comfortably, he respectfully addressed him
“Sage, I do not recall having seen you before. Why have you come here?
It was even more splendorous than hundreds of thousands of suns, and all of its parts were perfectly beautiful
An exceptional and amazing being has been born in this world
Is some misfortune to befall the prince?
Prince Sarvārthasiddha, however, will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood and turn the wheel of the unexcelled Dharma in a way that cannot be done by any ascetic, priest, god, demon, or anybody else who follows worldly teachings
He will teach in a way that is beneficial and brings happiness to the world, including the gods
He will share a teaching of pure conduct, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end
It will be a teaching with excellent meaning and excellent words. It will be unique, perfect, pure, purifying, and consummate
When those who are bound within the caste system hear his teaching
those who are not free from birth will be liberated. Likewise those who are afflicted by old age, sickness, death, grief, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and irritation will be liberated from old age, sickness, death, grief, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and irritation
Well, Great King
 Prince Sarvārthasiddha’s fingernails are rounded,  copper colored, and  glossy
 His fingers and toes are rounded,  long, and  well proportioned
Great King,  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has markings on his hands that are even,  clear,  deep,  straight, and  well arranged
 His body is well proportioned,  heroic,  beautiful, and  well composed
Great King,  Prince Sarvārthasiddha’s body is rounded,  very smooth,  straight, and  well structured
 His navel is deep,  not crooked, and  tapering
 of pure appearance, and  shines with a light that dispels all darkness
His sides are rounded,  well proportioned, and  straight
 His eyes are clear,  stainless,  warm,  elongated,  large, and  resemble blue lotuses
“Great King, Prince Sarvārthasiddha has  even eyebrows that are  thick,  dark,  continuous, and  tapered
 His cheeks are plump,  even,  unblemished, and  free from the flush of aggression
 His face and forehead are proportional
 His head is large
 His hair is black,  even,  fragrant,  soft,  well kempt,  well arranged, and  curly
Great King,  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has hair that curls into the forms of the endless knot, the mark of auspiciousness, the mark of eternal happiness, and the mark of prosperity
And so, monks, King Śuddhodana satisfied the sage Asita and his nephew Naradatta appropriately with a banquet, offered them fine garments, and circumambulated them
There he saw a person born who was as strong as Nārāyaṇa, with signs and splendorous merit; He rejoiced, his mind became joyful, and he gained strength
The sublime sage prostrated at the prince’s feet, circled him
He has great love, great compassion, and great joy, and is possessed of a noble mind by virtue of its equanimity
He is the great leader of the trichiliocosm and is worshiped by gods and humans
He has performed great sacrifices and possesses an exceedingly excellent accumulation of merit
Let us go and pay homage to him, serve him, respect him, and praise him
As they had now given the true prophecy, they returned to their own abodes
Then they circled and praised the Bodhisattva, Calling out, “This is the Buddha, the excellent Buddha!
Monks, on the very evening of the Bodhisattva’s birth, there were twenty thousand girls born among the ruling class, the priestly class, the merchants, and the householders, such as the landowners
Send away all the hunchbacks and all the blind, deaf, and mute people, as well as anyone who is deformed or crippled
Gather everything auspicious
Beat the drums of merit and ring the bells of auspiciousness
Surrounded by priests, townspeople, merchants, householders, ministers, local lords, gatekeepers, local people, friends, and kinfolk
they traveled through the richly ornamented roads, intersections, crossroads, and marketplaces, which were enveloped in the fragrant scent of incense and strewn with flower petals, filled with horses, elephants, chariots, and foot soldiers, with parasols, victory banners, and flags held aloft, and resounding with many instruments
This concludes the eighth chapter, on going to the temple
Monks, at the time of the constellation of Citrā, after the constellation of Hastā had passed, the chief priest of the king, who was called Udayana, the father of Udāyin, went before King Śuddhodana surrounded by some five hundred priests and said
“Your Majesty, please know that it is now proper for ornaments to be made for the prince.
He commissioned bracelets, anklets, crowns, necklaces, rings, earrings, armbands, golden belts, golden threads, nets of bells, nets of gems, shoes bedecked with jewels, garlands adorned with various gems, jeweled bangles, chokers, and diadems
When the ornaments were completed the Śākyas went before King Śuddhodana at the time of the constellation of Puṣya and said
“It is better if you ornament the prince and make these offerings to him, since I have commissioned the ornaments for the prince.
The prince should wear these ornaments that we have made for seven days and nights
This will make our efforts meaningful
Ten thousand girls welcomed the Bodhisattva and gazed at his countenance
Ten thousand Śākyas welcomed the Bodhisattva and gazed at his countenance
Remove the ornaments! Do not disturb the One Who Makes the Foolish Wise
He, who brings supreme knowledge, does not wear artificial ornaments
Having spoken these words, the goddess scattered divine flowers over the Bodhisattva and disappeared
Gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas revealed the upper halves of their bodies, and festooned wreaths of flowers and woven silk from the sky
All the Śākya factions, with King Śuddhodana leading the way, went ahead of the Bodhisattva
the schoolmaster, who was called Viśvāmitra, was unable to withstand the Bodhisattva’s splendor and radiance, and prostrated to him face-down on the ground
Will it be the Brāhmī script, the Kharoṣṭī script, or the Puṣkarasāri script? Will it be the Aṅga script, the Vaṅga script, the Magadha script, the Maṅgalya script, the Aṅgulīya script, the Śakāri script, the Brahmavali script, the Pāruṣya script, the Drāviḍa script, the Kirāta script, the Dākṣiṇya script, the Ugra script, the Saṃkhyā script, the Anuloma script, the Avamūrdha script,  the Darada script, the Khāṣya script, the Cīna script, the Lūna script, the Hūṇa script, the Madhyākṣara­vistara script, the Puṣpa script, the Deva script, the Nāga script, the Yakṣa script, the Gandharva script, the Kiṃnara script, the Mahoraga script, the Asura script, the Garuḍa script, the Mṛgacakra script, the Vāyasaruta script, the Bhaumadeva script, the Antarīkṣa­deva script, the Uttara­kuru­dvīpa script, the Aparagoḍānī script, the Pūrvavideha script, the Utkṣepa script, the Nikṣepa script, the Vikṣepa script, the Prakṣepa script, the Sāgara script, the Vajra script, the Lekhapratilekha script, the Anudruta script, the Śāstrāvarta script, the Gaṇanāvarta script, the Utkṣepāvarta script, the Nikṣepāvarta script, the Pādalikhita script, the Dviruttara­pada­saṃdhi script, the Yāvaddaśottara­pada­saṃdhi script, the Madhyāhāriṇī script, the Sarva­ruta­saṃgrahaṇī script, the Vidyānulomā­vimiśrita script, the Ṛṣi­tapastapta script, the Rocamāna script, the Dharaṇī­prekṣiṇī script, the Gagana­prekṣiṇī script, the Sarvauṣadhi­niṣyanda script, the Sarva­sāra­saṃgrahaṇī script, or the Sarva­bhūta­ruta­grahaṇī script? Master, which of those sixty-four scripts will you teach me?
the Gagana­prekṣiṇī script, the Sarvauṣadhi­niṣyanda script
This concludes the tenth chapter, on the demonstration at the writing school
Like an elephant tearing apart a fresh grove of mango trees, We proceed and reduce to ashes even the enormous diamond peak of Mount Meru
On a vast ocean of sorrow, This sublime vessel has appeared
The fourth sage said
“To those bound by the fetters of afflictions, A savior has appeared
Although the shade of all the trees had shifted by that time, the shade of the rose apple tree had not left the Bodhisattva’s body
Seeing him there, the minister was surprised
Elated with a sense of satisfaction and joy, he was ecstatic
In a state of jubilation he rushed before King Śuddhodana and said the following verses
He shines with glory and splendor Like Śakra or Brahmā
The shade of the tree Where this perfect being is seated Does not leave him
It shades this supreme being while he practices concentration.
and uttered this verse
Like seeing a fire blazing on a mountain peak, Or the moon present amid a cluster of stars
He bowed to the feet of the Bodhisattva and spoke to him in verse
“I have now twice bowed down to your feet, O Leader and Lord— Once when you were born, And now as you practice concentration, shining.
At midday, the Pristine Being, Unnoticed and without asking his parents, Went out to a village Accompanied by five hundred attendants
In that village, which belonged to the supreme king
There was a rose apple tree with many broad branches
Seeing the tree, the prince was disturbed by the suffering he had just understood, And remarked, “Conditioned things are no good! They bring a lot of suffering.
With a disciplined mind, he approached the shade of the rose apple tree
“We travel swiftly and without impediment, Penetrating the supreme Mount Meru, and likewise the surrounding ranges
Yet we are unable to pass beyond this rose apple tree. What could be the reason for this?
They said, “Holy One, Wellborn One, who brings happiness to the world! May you swiftly become awakened and lead beings to immortality
The king hurriedly left together with his companions And saw the prince sitting on a hill by the farming village, Benefiting others and blazing with splendor, Like a trillion rising suns
In conformity with worldly convention, he dwelt in that city, Yet the Pristine Being had fixed his mind on renouncing the palace
you know that the priests who are skilled in making predictions, as well as the gods who have definite knowledge
have foretold that if Prince Sarvārthasiddha renounces the household
The seven treasures that will be his are the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious wife, the precious jewel, the precious steward, and the precious minister
One by one, five hundred Śākyas each came forth and said
My daughter would be suitable for the prince
My son is difficult to match
“So we should ask the prince himself which girl he prefers.
As everyone gathered and broached the matter with the prince
He then thought
I know the endless pitfalls of desire— They are the root of suffering, rife with conflict, enmity, and despair. Desire is threatening, like a poisonous leaf
He then spoke the following verses
Lotuses thrive in filthy swamps
All were known to have wives, children, and harems, Yet they were not enamored with desire, nor deprived of the bliss of meditation
I too will emulate their merits
An ordinary woman, lacking qualities of proper conduct and honest speech, Would not be suitable for me at all
Someone who pleases me, who is modest, And perfectly pure in beauty, birth, family, and race would be fitting
She should be without pride, conceit, or hostility
She should be without deceit, jealousy, or guile, and not stray from uprightness
She should not lust after other men, even in dreams
Content with what is hers, she should lie with her husband, free from carelessness.  “She should not be arrogant or slothful. She should comport herself fittingly
he ordered his family priest, “Go, great priest, out to the city of Kapilavastu
Go to every household an
scrutinize the girls! If there is someone with these qualities
no matter whether she is a girl of royal caste, priestly caste, merchant caste, or servant caste—report to us about that girl
My son is not enthralled By family or caste
His mind delights in Good qualities, truth, and righteousness
Eventually he reached the house of the Śākya Daṇḍapāṇi
When he entered that dwelling, he saw a beautiful, pleasant, and captivating gir
was neither too tall nor too short, neither too fat nor too thin, neither too fair nor too dark, was in her first blush of youth, and was a jewel of a woman, just as the prince had described
He has written of the qualities of a wife; Whoever has those qualities will be his bride
He then gave the girl the letter
King Śuddhodana did indeed prepare some pleasing items made of gold, silver, and various jewels. Once the preparations were completed
he had the bell sounded in the city of Kapilavastu and announced the following decree
“O Prince, you pay no attention to me. Have I done anything inappropriate toward you
The prince replied, “Here, take all these other ornaments of mine as well
O child, enough with your questioning
But the prince insisted, “Your Majesty, it is absolutely essential that you tell me!
He asked King Śuddhodana three times, until finally the king told the Bodhisattva what was wrong
Then I will demonstrate my skills before them
King Śuddhodana then asked for the bell to be sounded in the city of Kapilavastu and announced
The daughter of Daṇḍapāṇi Śākya, the Śākya girl named Gopā, was put forward as a trophy for the victor, and a pledge was sworn: “Whoever here is victorious in swordsmanship, archery, combat, and wrestling shall have her
When he was then told that it was Sundarananda who had done so, he answered, “It was good that Sundarananda carried it out, but this animal has a huge body
In a movement like a great elephant in rut, The Bodhisattva grabbed hold of the great elephant with his big to
And hurled it far outside the fair city, Beyond seven of the city’s moats
This supremely wise one will surely Hurl the people who are bloated with the strength of pride Far beyond the city of saṃsāra, Alone, through the strength of his insight‌
Then five hundred Śākya boys emerged from the city and arrived at the place where they were to demonstrate their abilities in the arts
Neither you nor I know even the names Of the scripts and letters That this moon among men knows
And also for a sextillion and a nonillion, but beyond that is unknown to me
So in mathematics, the knowledge of the Peerless One is superior
Moreover, Śākyas, If he can calculate in the duration of a single utterance of the sound huṃ, All the dust particles, blades of grass, forests, Medicinal herbs, and drops of water in a trichiliocosm
Then what is so amazing about the other five hundred boys
hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joy
Monks, in this way all the Śākya youths were defeated an
the Bodhisattva alone stood out
As the day progressed, the Bodhisattva also excelled in all aspects of leaping, swimming, and running
Next Devadatta vied with the Bodhisattva. He was a conceited and arrogant young man, who was bloated with pride about his strength and his relationship to the Śākya lineage
In the arena filled with spectators, Devadatta first made a round clockwise
The Bodhisattva, however, was calm and unhurried. He playfully seized Devadatta with his right hand, twirled him into a triple spin, and tossed him to the ground. All the while the Bodhisattva’s mind was full of love. He did not intend to hurt Devadatta, but only to break his pride. Therefore Devadatta was unharmed
and then he lunged at the Bodhisattva
Grabbing Meru, the foremost mountain and the adamantine mountain ranges, And all other mountains throughout the ten directions, He could reduce them all to powder
So what is so amazing about a human body with no substance
Then Daṇḍapāṇi said to the Śākya youths, “This has now been tested and witnessed. Next let him demonstrate his skill in archery.
Then Sundarananda struck the drum target six times shouting-distance away, but he was also unable to shoot any farther
However, whichever bow the Bodhisattva drew, the string snapped or the bow broke
Your Majesty, may the bow be brought here! I would like to test it.” When the bow was brought to the assembly
all the Śākya youths tried pulling the bow with all their strength, but they were unable to string it, let alone draw it
The gods in the sky then addressed this verse to King Śuddhodana and to the masses
Just as this bow was drawn by the Sage Without rising from his seat
So will he undoubtedly fulfill his purpose And conquer the armies of Māra with ease
They said, “How amazing!  He has such expertise in the arts, without even having trained.
in leaping, and likewise in writing, finger counting, computation, arithmetic, wrestling, archery, running, rowing, swimming, elephant mounting, horsemanship, carriage driving, bow-and-arrow skills
hydromechanics, beeswax crafts, sewing, wickerwork, leaf cutting, and perfume making
In this way the Bodhisattva was superior in all the main aspects of the mundane arts, as well as in all practices beyond the reach of gods and humans. He was superior in leaping, and likewise in writing, finger counting, computation, arithmetic, wrestling, archery, running, rowing, swimming, elephant mounting, horsemanship, carriage driving, bow-and-arrow skills, balance and strength, heroics, gymnastics, elephant driving, lassoing, rising, advancing, retreating, gripping with the hand, gripping using the foot, gripping using the top of the head, cutting, cleaving, breaking, rubbing, target shooting without causing injury, target shooting at vital points, target shooting through only hearing the target, striking hard, playing dice, poetry composition, prose composition, painting, drama, dramatic action, tactical analysis, attending the sacred fire, playing the lute, playing other musical instruments, dancing, singing, chanting, storytelling, comedy, dancing to music, dramatic dancing, mimicry, garland stringing, cooling with a fan, dying precious gems, dying clothes, creating optical illusions, dream analysis, bird sounds, analysis of women, analysis of men, analysis of horses, analysis of elephants, analysis of cattle, analysis of goats, analysis of sheep, analysis of dogs, ritual science and its related lexicon, revealed scripture, ancient stories, history, the Vedas, grammar, etymologies, phonetics, metrics and composition, rules for conducting rituals, astrology, the Sāmkhya philosophical system, the Yoga philosophical system, ceremonies, the art of courtesans, the Vaiśeṣika philosophical system, economics, ethics, hydraulics, knowledge of demigods, knowledge of game animals, knowledge of bird sounds, logic, hydromechanics, beeswax crafts, sewing, wickerwork, leaf cutting, and perfume making
When that became clear, the Śākya Daṇḍapāṇi decided to give away his daughter, the Śākya girl Gopā, to the Bodhisattva
King Śuddhodana also formally requested her hand in marriage for the Bodhisattva
What good is it to cover their faces
Furthermore the great sages, those who know the thoughts of others
So why should I veil my face
Monks, when King Śuddhodana heard these eloquent verses from the Śākya girl Gopā
he felt satisfied and happy, and he cheerfully rejoiced
That these two pristine beings have come together Is just like butter and clarified butter
This concludes the twelfth chapter, on demonstrating skill in the arts
Now, isn’t this sacred being staying too long among the consorts? There are beings who have been brought to maturity over a long period of time through the four means of attracting disciples, namely generosity, kind talk, meaningful actions, and practicing what one preaches
Once he attains awakening, those beings would be able to understand his teachings on the Dharma. But perhaps all these suitable recipients for his teaching may be gone by then. In that case, the Bodhisattva will leave his home and awaken to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood on his own.” So they approached the Bodhisattva
Or teaching, through a vast display of buddhahood, according to the wishes of the world, including its gods, humans, and demigods, and satisfying them
Monks, for a long time—many uncountable eons
the Bodhisattva had always and continuously been without any need to rely on others. He was his own master with regard to worldly concerns, as well as those that go beyond the world
For a long time he had known the right time, the occasion, and the opportunity for the practice of all aspects of the roots of virtue
he could manifest miraculous powers
He knew indeed what was timely as well as what was untimely
Seeking the right opportunity, he would never miss it,  just like the great ocean, which is always timely
Since he possessed the power of clairvoyant wisdo
This is the appropriate time for reaching out
this is the time for separation
this is the time for getting together
this is the time for showing kindness
this is the time for resting in equanimity
this is the time to speak
this is the time to remain silent
this is the time to stay within royal circles
this is the time to be among priests and householders
and this is the time to be among gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the world protectors, monks, nuns, as well as male and female novices
This is the time to teach the Dharma
and this is the time to rest inwardly
At all times the Bodhisattva knew whether the time was suitable or not, and he watched out for opportunities
Monks, for bodhisattvas who have reached their last existence, it is customary that the buddhas, the blessed ones, who dwell in the realms within the ten directions, always come while these bodhisattvas amuse themselves in the female quarters and encourage them through singing and music to enter the gate of Dharma
You previously made an aspiration To become their protector and refuge, As well as their supreme supporter and defender
Virtuous Hero! Remember your previous actions And your vow to help others
The many beings afflicted by anger and blemished by hate Must be embraced by your love, Thus-Gone One
Those who are lost and without any qualities of goodness And the many unskillful ones must all feel your compassion
With your merit and wisdom, virtue pervades your body
With your stainless concentration and higher knowledge, you shine brightly. You illumine the ten directions
Like the stainless moon free from clouds
Many such pleasing words, accompanied by music, Are sung by the victorious ones
There were grounds covered in blue beryl that reflected all the many fine features of the palace
It was so delightful to watch, and thus one could never get enough
The exquisite and perfect mansion where the  Bodhisattva lived was a source of supreme pleasures and joy. In his palace his body was always pure and stainless, he was adorned with flower garlands and jewelry, and his limbs were scented with the finest and most sweet-smelling oils
‘I will awaken to the supreme state without old age or grief So that I can deliver all beings from death, old age, and other sufferings.
Hero, you made the following promise
In the past you gave away your exquisite wealth and riches, And even your hands, feet, and dear body
Virtuous One, you will tame Māra, the evil one, and his army, And dry up the entire three lower realms
Quickly attain the state without death or sorrow, And satisfy those who suffer from thirst with the nectar of immortality.
Now remember your supreme vow from the past
I will leave behind this beautiful town
In your past lives you gave away your wealth, jewels, and gold; Your beloved wife and children; your land, cities, and villages; And even your own head, eyes, hands, and feet
After you died you were reborn in the divine realms
Prince, in the past you were a perfect sage
In the past you approached the sage Śyāma at his place by the tree; He asked you how many leaves were on the tree
With your skill you counted the leaves accurately And told him the exact number
Then, by the glory of the victorious ones in the ten directions
These wonderful verses emerge from the beautiful sounds of the instruments
You vowed, ‘I will be the protector of the world plagued by old age and death.’ Light of the World, in times past, for many eons, you have made this wish
Giving away your wealth, gems, gold, fine cloth, a variety of jewels, Your hands, feet, eyes, your beloved child, and the wealth of your kingdom. Still you never had any resentment or anger for those who took it
Delighting in forbearance, you had patience with the many harms, sufferings, Harsh words, murders, and imprisonments inflicted upon you by others
Since you delight in concentration, your personal qualities benefit others
A skilled meditator, you destroyed afflictions with calmness, discipline, and restraint, And tamed the fickle mind, which chases after the pleasures of the senses
You know their actions, languages, and capacities. You have perfected the way, the discipline, and different types of memory
In the past, when you saw anyone with wrong views, Who suffered from old age, death, and all the different afflictions
These many virtuous and beautiful verses emerge from the tune of the instruments; By the glory of the victorious ones, they encourage the hero
You gave away your wife, sons, daughters, body, kingdom, and even your life
For the sake of awakening, you gave away without limits what is hard to abandon
You have been kings rich in merit and renowned for splendor: Nimindhara, Nimi, Kṛṣṇabandhu, Brahmadatta, Keśarin, Sahasrayajña, Dharmacinti, Arcimat, and Dṛḍhadhanu
Always considering the matter well, you gave to lowly people what is hard to give
O Royal Sage, you were the moon-like hero Satyavardhana, The king Subhāṣita­gaveṣin, and the gentle Sumati
As you searched for supreme awakening in order to liberate others then
And made an inconceivable and limitless number of offerings to them
Hero, now the time has come to renounce this perfect city
Beautiful forms, sweet sounds, fragrant smells, Delicious tastes, and pleasant touch
The snare of these unfortunate times has caught beings
Desired objects are like a moon reflected in water, Like a reflection, or an echo
Like an illusion, or like a theater play, Or like a dream—thus perceive the noble ones
Desired objects are momentary and empty. They are as untrue as a magical illusion or a mirage
They have no substance, like a bubble of water or foam
Death robs everyone, like a river carrying off a tree
While the group of delighted women Are waking up the Great Sage with their music
At this time, through the power of the thus-gone ones
These wonderful verses come out from the sound of the instruments
Everything compounded quickly disintegrates
Your time has now come— The time for leaving home, Disciplined One! “Conditioned things are impermanent and without stability
Being all in mutual dependence, One thing follows after another
And it cannot be seen where one thing ends and the other begins
When you have a seed, a sprout can grow, Yet the seed is not the sprout. Still it is not different
In this way the true nature knows no permanence or impermanence
Formative factors have ignorance for their cause
Formative factors do not truly exist
Ignorance and formative factors Are naturally empty and inert
Sound is based on wood and strings Meeting with the movements of the hands. Due to these three things, sounds can emerge From instruments such as the melodious lute
Everything is essentially like space
That everything is this way, You realized when you met Dīpaṃkara
That which you understood, exactly as it is, You must now make gods and humans comprehend
In order to block the way to the three lower realms
‘I will show millions of beings The perfect gate to the nectar of the higher realms.’ Saying this, you guarded your discipline wel
Do not abandon those who engage in harmful actions, Due to being disturbed by animosity, ill will, and harmful wishes
‘I will bring those beings to the stage of forbearance
Saying this, you have relied on diligence to achieve that
Remember your previous actions
Do not abandon those afflicted beings Who are agitated by the web of disturbing emotions
Verses like this emerge from The sounds of the women’s instruments
Hearing them, all the Bodhisattva’s sleepiness vanishe
And he sets his mind on perfect and supreme awakening
Monks, in this way, even as the Bodhisattva was with his retinue of consorts, he could not avoid hearing the sound of the Dharma
He understood that in the end, any amount of wealth will be used up
He understood that saṃsāra is full of many calamities and terrors
He delighted in the domain of a thus-gone one, because he had separated himself from the domain of Māra
Perceiving the three realms to be ablaze with the shortcomings of existence, his wish was to free himself from them
and he became skilled in removing himself from the shortcomings and faults of cyclic existence
His wish was to become ordained, and his mind was filled with the thought of leaving home
His wish was to be completely on his own and at peace
He accumulated perfect merit and guarded it well
he freed himself from any stains or miserliness, and was fully in control of his thoughts
Disturbing emotions resulting from negative speech, harmful talk, adversity, criticism, blaming, cursing, beatings, threats, murder, bondage, and imprisonment did not perturb his mind
His mind was filled with thoughts about the nature of impermanence, suffering, and repulsiveness. He was trained in the applications of mindfulness, the thorough relinquishments, the bases of miraculous power, the faculties, the powers, the branches of awakening, the path, the four truths of the noble ones, and all the principles conducive to awakening
Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva lived according to the Dharma
The first Dharma gate that he manifested is called pure accomplishment. It refers to the four means of attracting disciples: generosity, kind talk, meaningful actions, and practicing what one preaches
The fourth Dharma gate that he manifested is called the great array. It accomplishes the unique strength of the accumulation of wisdom, which ascertains the meaning of the different categories related to all the factors of awakening
“Generosity, calmness, collectedness, discipline, Forbearance, diligence, Concentration, absorption, Knowledge, and means.” Such were the words that emerged
“Through settling on love, compassion, Joy, equanimity, higher knowledge, And the four means of attracting disciples, You will ripen beings.” Such were the words that emerged
“The divisions of the supreme eightfold path of the noble ones, Tranquility, insight, impermanence, Suffering, lack of self, and repulsiveness.” Such were the words that emerged from the instruments
“Freedom from attachment, solitude, Knowledge of extinction, nonarising, Cessation, nonabiding, and nirvāṇa.” Such were the words that emerged from the instruments
Then, in the quiet of the night, he arrived at the palace together with an assembly of , gods in order to serve and venerate the Bodhisattva
As he arrived, he stopped in midair and sang these verses to the Bodhisattva
They await you, thinking, ‘We shall witness his awakening.
Utter now the sound of the victorious ones’ voice, The voice that is genuine and free from error!
This concludes the thirteenth chapter, on encouragement
Monks, while the god in this way was encouraging the Bodhisattva, a dream occurred to King Śuddhodana
As he was sleeping, King Śuddhodana dreamed tha
the Bodhisattva was leaving the palace in the quiet of the night,  surrounded by a host of gods. As the Bodhisattva left the palace
the king saw that he had become ordained and was wearing the saffron-colored robes
While they were ascending and descending the stairs, their calls could be heard for a distance of half a league. Everyone thought, “The young prince will never be able to leave without being noticed.
Nevertheless all the astrologers and fortunetellers kept making the same prediction, saying, “The young prince will leave through the Gate of Auspiciousness.
So the king had massive door panels fitted into the Gate of Auspiciousness
so large that it took five hundred men to open and close each of them
“I will go to the parks, so quick, go and prepare my chariot.
The king provided the palaces with the five desirable things, the likes of which had never been seen before
But the charioteer went to  King Śuddhodana and told him
On hearing that, King Śuddhodana thought to himself
Seven days from now, the young prince will be visiting the grounds of the pleasure grove
and every nice thing, pleasing to the senses, has been brought forth!
he dispatched bell ringers and made the following announcement to the people in his city
When the Bodhisattva saw the man, he asked his charioteer the following, even though he already knew the answer
Charioteer! Who is that decrepit man? He is so weak, emaciated, and wrinkled
His head is all gray, his teeth are few and far between, and his body is so skinny
Holding his stick, he sways in discomfort from side to side
The charioteer replied
Your Highness, that man is overcome by old age
His senses are weak, he suffers greatly, and his strength and energy are gone
His relatives despise him and no one looks after him
Unable to function, he has been abandoned like a piece of wood in the forest
Your Highness, that is not the practice of his caste or the state
However, monks, sometime later, while the Bodhisattva was setting out for the parks through the southern city gate, again accompanied by a large parade
he saw on the road a man suffering from disease
His body was weak, and he was suffering greatly as he lay in his own urine and feces
There was no one to take care of him or assist him
“Charioteer, who is this man carried on the stretcher? The other people have surrounded him, And they keep pulling their hair, scratching their faces with their fingernails, Throwing dust on their heads, beating their chests, and crying in distress.
through the power of the Bodhisattva the gods emanated a mendicant in the street where they were passing
At the gates there are men fond of combat, holding their swords aloft
The swans, cranes, peacocks, mynas, and parrots do not make any sounds. They sit on terraces, by palace windows, on gateways, parapets, and pedestals; Depressed, unhappy, and miserable, they hang their heads and remain silent
“Lord, what is going to befall me? Please tell me the meaning of these dreams! My memory is confused, and I cannot see clearly. My heart is aching!
His students join their palms, and the gods all venerate him
He sees himself victorious in the midst of a battle, With the immortals in the sky cheering him in joyous voices
Such signs did the Bodhisattva see in his dreams, And he saw the fulfillment of his virtuous and excellent conduct
The gods and humans who heard this were delighted and thought, “Soon he shall become the god of humans and gods!
This concludes the fourteenth chapter, on dreams
Monks, in the meantime the Bodhisattva thought to himself
It would be very ungrateful of me
So that night when everything became quiet, he left his own quarters and entered the quarters of King Śuddhodana
When the king heard these words from the best among men, He diminished his longing, let go of his attachment for his son, and said
Light bright lamps and fasten all jewels to the peak of the banners
Hang garlands of pearls and illuminate this entire palace
Arm yourselves! Carry in your hands weapons— Swords and lances, bows and arrows, and two-pointed spears
To guard our beloved prince
Wear flower ornaments, half-moon ornaments, and chains. Adorn yourselves with belts, rings, and earring
Take care to fasten your anklets well
Should this benefactor of humans and gods, who acts like a proud elephant
Upon my trunk I will erect a mansion thirty-two leagues tall
In that mansion divine maidens  can assemble to serve and venerate the Bodhisattva by making music, singing songs, and playing instruments
he was thinking about four aspiration prayers that he had formed in the past
At that time I donned the armor of the following fourfold resolve
First, I have seen how sentient beings suffer. So may I free and liberate those who are bound to the world and caught in the prison of cyclic existence
May I liberate sentient beings from the tight shackles and chains of craving
Such was his first aspiration prayer from the past
May I shine the light of Dharma for those who are thrown deep into the darkness of great ignorance within the world—for the people whose eyes are obscured by the cataract of ignorance, who lack the eye of wisdom, and who are blind with ignorance and delusion. May I raise the lamp of wisdom, which destroys the darkness for those who are blinded by ignorance
May I remove the darkness of ignorance and all cataracts and faults of dullness, and in this way purify their wisdom eye
he thought of his second aspiration prayer from the past
“Alas, this world has raised the banner of pride and egotism. It is obsessed with clinging to ‘I’ and ‘mine.’ People’s minds grasp at the self, and false notions of a self distort their views. May I bring down this banner of pride that thinks ‘I am’ by showing them the noble path.
the Bodhisattva thought of his third aspiration prayer from the past
They always move and circle back and forth between this world and the next. Their spinning around knows no end and resembles a firebrand’s circle
the Bodhisattva thought of his fourth aspiration prayer from the past
Right then the god Dharmacārin and the gods of the pure realms made the retinue of consorts appear unappealing
After the gods had revealed the consorts’ unpleasant and unattractive features, they took position in the sky an
How can you be so delighted When living amid a cemetery
He was filled with distaste and had made up his mind. So without any delay, he gracefully rose from his seat in the music hall and turned toward the east. With his right hand he parted the bejeweled lattice and went onto the palace roof
There he folded his hands and, recalling all the buddhas, he bowed to them
holding flowers, incense, garlands, perfumes, scented powder, garments, parasols, victory banners, flags, earrings made of flowers, and garlands made of precious stones
The Bodhisattva also saw the four guardians of the world together with hordes of yakṣas, demons, gandharvas, and nāgas. They all wore solid armor, corselets, and helmets. In their arms they held swords, bows and arrows, spears, javelins, and tridents. They gracefully took off their bejeweled diadems and crowns and bowed before the Bodhisattva
Your invincible gait is as graceful as that of a confident elephant; You walk and place your feet beautifully, with the gait of a bull, a lion, or a swan
you who whose eyebrows are long And who has eyes as beautiful as blooming lotuses? A lion among men, with a face like the autumn moon
The moon that delights the lotuses of the night? “Your face is like a blooming white lotus; It is as tender as a young blue lotus
Chanda replied
I have heard, my Lord, that when you were born, you were brought to the priests who are skilled in making predictions based on examining signs. They prophesied before your father, King Śuddhodana, ‘Your Majesty, your royal line will flourish.’ When King Śuddhodana inquired further
Your newborn son possesses a hundred marks of merit And blazes with the splendor of merit
My Lord, there is this prophecy and it cannot be denied
But please listen to what I have to say, for I may be able to help you
My Lord, why is it that some people go through disciplined actions and practice austerities
They wear deerskin and tie their hair in a topknot. They wear garments made of tree bark
They let their nails, hair, and beard grow long
Your palaces  are like the palace of Vaijayanta, wherein one finds the peace of true Dharma, and all one’s worries are gone
Since your palaces are the color of autumn clouds, they resemble Mount Kailāśa
They sing songs while playing melodious music and dancing. They play tuṇas, paṇavas, flutes, lutes, wood kettledrums, reed pipes, wooden pins, cymbals, kimpalas, nakalus, guitars, clay kettledrums with a good sound, and paṭahas. They attend upon you with comedy and dance—playful, enjoyable, happy, and sweet
You are a fresh and tender boy with black hair and a body like a lotus. You have not yet given yourself to the pleasures of the senses
So now enjoy yourself, like the lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the lord of the gods, the one endowed with a thousand eyes
You know the techniques of enjoyment, so relish them, Like the powerful lord of gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
They produce anxiety, cause strife, and generate distress and faults. Knowing this, the wise ones avoid them
At that moment he spoke the following verses
Wise people avoid the sense pleasures like the head of a snake
Why do some persevere in many austerities? They wear deerskin and let their hair, beard, and nails grow long; They cover themselves in tree bark. Adhering to their practices of austerities, many have emaciated bodies
Some eat only vegetables, millet, and the gardūla plant
Others, who have vowed to adopt the behavior of a cow, always keep their heads down
We, however, should become the best and most distinguished in the world
We should be supreme universal monarchs and guardians of the world, “Or vajra holders like Śakra, or the chief god in the Heaven Free from Strife, Aspiring to experience the bliss of meditation in the realm of Brahmā
Perfect Being, your kingdom is wealthy, flourishing with excellent harvests. Full of parks and palaces, it equals the Vaijayanta Palace
All things move and change and are impermanent like clouds; They may be likened to a flash of lightning
They are like a dewdrop on a blade of grass, and deceptive like an empty fist; They have no essence and no self, and lack intrinsic existence in every way
So my mind is not attached to objects anymore. Chanda, bring me Kaṇṭhaka, well adorned, the supreme king of all horses
My auspicious aspirations from the past have been fulfilled; Overcoming everything, I will become a master of all phenomena, a king of Dharma, a sage
Don’t you see these women with eyes like blooming lotuses, Who are adorned with garlands of many precious gems, Sparkling like a flash of lightning amid cloud banks in the sky, So beautiful as they rest on their beds
Or those who play such sweet-sounding flutes and cymbals, Clay drums and reed pipes, making music and song
Moreover, Chanda, I see that this world is suffering; It is caught in the midst of cyclic existence. It is a wilderness of misery, full of afflictions and evil, Where beings are constantly swept away.  “Without refuge or purpose
beings wander in the darkness of ignorance and delusion; They suffer from the terrors of old age, sickness, and death. They are assailed by the sufferings attendant upon taking birth, And they suffer the onslaughts of enemies
So I will now assemble the ship of Dharma. It is constructed with the strongest wood— Giving, disciplined conduct, patience, and diligence— And firmly secured by my indestructible, superior motivation
I will cross the ocean of existence, Infested with the monsters of harmful views and the demons of affliction
With a mind not attached to any object, And with compassion and love for sentient beings
Monks, when the gods Śāntamati and Lalitavyūha understood the Bodhisattva’s determination
they caused all men, women, and children in the city of Kapilavastu to fall asleep
and that the moon was in the constellation of Puṣya, the lord of constellations
He was aware that right then the time had come for him to leave home
The great king Virūḍhaka arrived from the south with several trillion kumbhāṇḍas holding in their hands various pearl necklaces.  In addition they carried various precious gems, and vases filled with different types of perfumes
A long time ago, while seeking to benefit beings, I made the wish to liberate the world Once I attained the state of awakening beyond old age or death. Now that time has come
All protector gods of heaven and earth came, As did Śakra, lord of the gods, along with his following
The gods of the Heaven Free from Strife, the Heaven of Joy, and the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, And the gods of the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations all came
So did the nāga kings Varuṇa, Manasvin, Anavapta, as well as Sāgara
At the time when the Supreme Being departed, All the gods were eager to present offerings
Let us see the departure of the Victorious One, And make offerings to him in an appropriate manner
I will accompany you. As you make an end to desire, may you encounter no obstacles
Chanda, bring Kaṇṭhaka, well adorned and well groomed. Do not create obstacles and do not hesitate, if you have any affection for me
Look at glorious Śakra, Śacī’s husband, who is at the gates with his army. Look at the gods, demigods, and kiṃnaras who are here making offerings
May all your past aspirations become fulfilled! Please proceed
May all obstacles be pacified and your desired disciplined conduct be accomplished
When the Bodhisattva rose from his seat, the earth shook in six ways
No longer will I hear the singing of the birds, Or the sweet sound of the flute in the female quarters, Or the sound of songs with propitious lyrics, Which you, One of Infinite Fame, used to hear on waking up
If you, the great tree of merit, depart
The might of the Śākyas on this earth will come to nothing
And the royal family line will be interrupted
The hopes of the assembly of Śākyas will be dashed entirel
I will not turn my face toward Kapilavastu, Whether I am standing, sitting, lying down, or walking
His mind is always suffused with love, and his compassion is complete
He has defeated the demon of death and the demon of the god
He is the great leader who soon will teach the supreme, eightfold path of the noble ones To those who are established in wrong paths
Monks, once the Bodhisattva had left his home, he crossed over the lands of the Śākyas, the Kroḍyas, and the Mallas
When day broke, he had arrived six leagues away from the town of Anumaineya in the country of Maineya
This memorial is still known today as “Chanda’s Return.
Then he will free them from old age, death, sickness, pain, lamentation, suffering, depression, and distress, an
ferry them to the other shore of the ocean of saṃsāra
But the prince was nowhere to be found, whether inside or outside the gates
Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī collapsed on the ground lamenting and said to King Śuddhodana
Since those who can read signs and the future had prophesied that the Bodhisattva would leave through the Gate of Auspiciousness, the messengers proceeded to this gate
and they thought
He must have left this way
When they had traveled a little farther
they met the god who was carrying the Bodhisattva’s silken garments on his head. Again they thought
What the prince said will happen is in fact what will happen
And why will the prince not return? Because of his enthusiasm, discipline, and steadfastness
Three young Śākyas called Bhadrika, Mahānāma, and Aniruddha tried for a long time to lift the ornaments, but they were unable to. These ornaments were made for someone with a body as strong as Nārāyaṇa, and so other people were not able to wear them
When Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī saw that nobody could move the ornaments, she thought
They let out cries that reached the king’s quarters: “Alas, we have been deceived! Where did the Bodhisattva go?
The maternal aunt, who also felt miserable, Tried to console her, saying, “Daughter of the Śākyas, do not cry
The supreme noble one among men has said in the past: ‘I will liberate this world from birth and old age.
‘The young prince has left. Please do not be saddened! When he attains awakening, he will return. Then you will listen to the Dharma and find peace.’ 
“It is wrong to assume that the prince returned here Before having attained awakening.
With tears I had to bring him the king of all horses
I then told him, ‘Benefactor of Beings, go wherever you please.
She fainted and collapsed on the ground
Startled, the large gathering of women Brought water, washed her
“May our Śākya princess not die now! It would be too much to bear if we lost two loved ones!
Around midnight, when the gathering of ladies Were deeply asleep, secretly The One Elevated with Hundreds of Merits Told me to bring his horse Kaṇṭhaka
But the gods blocked my words, And so not even one lady awoke
Weeping, I adorned that king of horses And gave it to the most exalted among men
Kaṇṭhaka, look at the path prepared for you in the sky! It is so bright and beautiful. Its bejeweled ledges are ornamented in various ways, And it is censed with divine incense based on supreme essences
Instead, rejoice in He Who Is Elevated by Hundreds of Splendors and Merits, And do not weep anymore
This concludes the fifteenth chapter, on leaving home
Monks, the Bodhisattva first gave his silken robes to a god in the form of a hunter, and then he donned the hunter’s saffron-colored robes
The Bodhisattva then went to the hermitage of a brahmin woman called Śākī
The woman invited the Bodhisattva to stay and have a meal
At that time Ārāḍa Kālāma had arrived in Vaiśālī, where he resided together with a saṅgha of listeners and three hundred students
to whom he delivered teachings on the practices related to the sense field of utter absence
When Ārāḍa Kālāma saw the Bodhisattva approaching in the distance, he was amazed and told his students
Monks, I then thought to myself
“I have faith. I am also diligent. I am mindful and I can practice absorption. I also have knowledge. So therefore, in order to master and actualize that teaching, I will practice on my own in a solitary place, without getting distracted.
Monks, I then went to Ārāḍa Kālāma and asked him
“Ārāḍa Kālāma, you have understood and actualized this teaching, isn’t that true?
“Well then, Gautama, whatever teaching I know, you also know. And whatever you know, I also know
Ārāḍa’s teaching does not bring freedom
When the people of Rājagṛha saw me, they were amazed an
thought, “Goodness, is that Brahmā? Or perhaps Śakra, king of the gods, or Vaiśravaṇa? Or is it some kind of mountain god?
Stainless and of infinite glory, The Bodhisattva becomes a mendicant of his own will
People move out of his way, only to follow behind him
They ask, “Who is that being whom we have never seen befor
All business and shopping comes to an end; Even those in the bars stop drinking
They cannot stay still in their houses or in the street
Quickly one man runs to the palace And joyfully relates the story to King Bimbisāra
Filling the streets, they leave their houses empty; Dropping all other tasks, they only stare at this perfect man
As they behold the form of this perfect man
Others say it is a god from the Heaven of Joy or the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations; Some suggest it is a god from the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations
There are some who say that it is the Moon or the Sun; Some say it is Rāhu, Balī, or Vemacitri
Still others are saying, “He lives on Pāṇḍava, the king of mountains.
You are young and in the prime of life; You have a beautiful complexion and you are strong
Let me offer you much wealth and many women. “Please stay in my kingdom and enjoy yourself
The king of Magadha responds to the Bodhisattva
The Bodhisattva replies in a gentle voice, With love and concern for the king’s welfare
King, may fortune always be with you! I do not seek desirable objects
They destroy everything that is good, and should be avoided
If people don’t get what they want, their desires burn; But even if they do get what they want, it is never enough
However, when desires consume someone who is unable to handle them, That is when these terrifying desires bring the most pain
Yet, Your Majesty, whoever is peaceful and gentle, Informed by the noble and stainless Dharma, And filled with knowledge—he is satisfied
For him desirable objects have no attraction
Your Majesty, if one follows after desire, It will never end
Like drinking salty water, Following after desire only increases craving
The king of Magadha now asks
Monk, where do you come from? Where were you born? Where are your father and mother
Once again the king bows to the Bodhisattva’s feet; He circumambulates the Bodhisattva with the greatest respect
Then, surrounded by his entourage, The ruler returns to his royal palace
Monks, at that time a son of Rāma by the name of Rudraka arrived in Rājagṛha, where he stayed with a large group of seven hundred of his students
He was teaching his students the principles of the disciplined conduct necessary for attaining the state where there is neither perception nor nonperception
He will also not have an understanding based on direct perception
In this way he will never renounce his concentration, absorption, and states of equilibrium, which are fabricated, defiled, and perpetuating
Therefore I must first actualize these experiences myself. In that way I can demonstrate that his worldly absorptions, which are limited to concentration and which only support states of equilibrium, do not carry a result
and become accepted as his student in order to demonstrate the superiority of the qualities of my own absorption. I will demonstrate to him that fabricated absorptions are pointless
“My friend, who is your teacher? Who taught you so well?
My friend, I did not have a teacher
Nevertheless I did reach a genuine understanding on my own
“Yes indeed, I will let you follow me so that you can obtain instructions for my path of absorption.
“My friend, is there any higher path than the state of neither perception nor nonperception?
At that point the Bodhisattva arose from his seat, mindful and attentive, and went to see Rudraka, the son of Rāma
“No,” Rudraka replied
“Rudraka is not the only one who has faith, diligence, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. I am also faithful, diligent, mindful, concentrated, and wise.
He therefore addressed Rudraka with these words
“My friend, I have now understood the teaching in which you are adept.
“Well, in that case, come, we should teach everyone together.” And accordingly he installed the Bodhisattva as a teacher on the same level as himself
The Bodhisattva then said, “My friend, this path does not free the mind
Neither does it free one from attachment. It also does not lead to cessation or peace
It does not bring higher knowledge, nor does it lead to complete awakening
At that point there were five ascetic companions who were learning religious practices under the guidance of Rudraka, the son of Rāma
They thought to themselves
Even though we have tried and persisted for a long time in this way, we have not been able to realize our goal
Monks, afterward the Bodhisattva proceeded through Magadha and eventually arrived at Gaya
At the peak of Mount Gaya, the Bodhisattva stayed in order to apply himself to strenuous practice
There are some monks and priests who are unable to separate their mind and body from the objects of their desire
They further harm themselves and torment their bodies and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of suffering
Therefore, in doing so, they become incapable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is superior to any human teaching
This is like a person who tries in vain to create a fire in order to make light by rubbing together two wet pieces of wood that have been submerged in water. He will not be able to produce fire and make light
This is the same as the monks and priests who are unable to separate their mind and body from the objects of their desire
They delight in those objects and feel attached to them, long for them, wish for them, strive for them, crave and thirst for them, become senseless for them, and are burned by them. This striving after the objects of desire never brings peace
They are like a person who wishes to create a fire in order to make light
and therefore places a dry piece of wood on the ground and rubs another dry piece of wood against it
For such a person the fire will ignite, and light will shine
I do nevertheless find peace
I have been born in this world at the time of the five degenerations among beings who are occupied with lowly pursuits
These various religious practitioners have so many orientations and views
They wholly fixate on the body. They seek to purify the body by oppressing it in various ways. In complete ignorance, they give instructions
Some, for example
make use of spells, lick their hands, remain seated, cease talking, ingest various roots
Some dress themselves in the feathers of vultures or owls, while others wear planks, muñja grass, asana bark, darbha grass, or valvaja grass. Others don a cloak made of camel wool, goat wool, horsehair, or simply a hide. Still others only put on wet clothes
Some smear their bodies with ashes, soot, dead flower pollen, coal dust, dirt, and mud
Others adorn themselves with bodily hair, reeds, scalp hair, fingernails, rags, ribs, and skulls
Some wear dyes of charcoal, minerals, or saffron, shave their heads, carry vases, human skulls, and clubs
In such ways do these fools believe themselves to be pure
They stand on one foot, raise one hand in the air, and stay in just one spot
Such are the hardships that they undergo
Considering themselves pure, they take refuge in and pay homage to beings that they believe to be essential, such as Brahmā, Indra, Rudra, Viṣṇu, Devī, Kumāra, Mātṛ, Katyāyanī, Candra, Āditya, Vaiśravaṇa, Varuṇa, the Vāsus, the Aśvins, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, rākṣasas, bhūtas, kumbhāṇḍas, pretas, gaṇas, ancestors, piśācas, devarṣis, rājarṣis, and brahmarṣis
They also believe that yogurt, butter, mustard seeds, barley, magic strings, dūrvā grass, jewels, gold, silver,  and other such items are auspicious
They take as pure that which is not pure. “However, if I now attain mastery in the prescribed practices and austerities, all the opposing views will become suppressed
And as for the gods in the realms of meditative concentration and form, if I can demonstrate a superior meditative concentration, they will become interested.
Except for a bodhisattva who has reached his last existence and rests in equanimity in all-pervasive absorption
there is no one, human or nonhuman, who is capable of undergoing such hardships
This absorption is called all-pervasive because as the Bodhisattva rested in equanimity in the fourth absorption, from the very beginning all movements of the breath slowed down and ceased, an
the absorption was nonconceptual
There was no thought, no movement, no conceptual mind, and no change, yet it was all-pervading and not dependent on anything
This absorption is likened to space, because like space—which is motionless, uncaused, and changeless—there is nowhere it cannot reach
and to develop bravery of mind
the Bodhisattva sat down on the rugged earth, crossed his legs, and began to punish and torment his body through his mental resolve
Such was the manner, monks, in which my mind brought punishment and torment on my body
Sweat ran from my armpits and from my forehead and, as the sweat fell on the ground
the drops turned into hoarfrost, then grew hot, and evaporated
The sound was as loud and intense as when a blacksmith’s bellows is being squeezed
Monks, all the while there was no movement of my breath through my mouth and nose, there was this intense, loud noise in my ears
Monks, it felt as if someone was striking my skull with a sharp spear
Monks, in that way, as my mouth, nose, and ears were blocked, my in-breaths and out-breaths were pushing up and hitting my skull
May this son of the Śākya kings, Who has not fulfilled his aim in the forest here
Not pass away without fulfilling his intention, And thus leave this triple world suffering and without a defender
Māyādevī surrounded herself with a retinue of goddesses, an
at midnight they went to the bank of the Nairañjanā River where the Bodhisattva was staying
My son, you have not yet had the joys of a universal monarch’s splendors
And now you are passing away in this forest without attaining awakening
Māyādevī replied
“It is I, your mother, O son, Who for ten months Carried you in my womb like a diamond. It is I who now cry out in despair.
Then, in order to console her, the Bodhisattva told her
Renouncing the world for the sake of awakening is indeed meaningful
What the priest Asita predicted shall come true
As soon as Māyādevī heard this, she became overjoyed, and the hair on her body stood on end
Sprinkling the Bodhisattva with māndārava flowers, she circumambulated him three times
Previously his complexion was so beautiful, but now it has all changed.
Monks, at that point I thought to myself, “I must apply myself to eating even less than this
I realized that I should henceforth live on only a single grain of rice and restrain myself from eating two
Monks, you may think that the rice grains of that time were larger than now, but that is not the case
They were just as they are now
Monks, as I now lived on only a single grain of rice, my body quickly grew thinner
I realized that I should henceforth live on only a single sesame seed and restrain myself from eating two
people continued to remark on how my previously beautiful complexion had disappeared
He lived on just a single sesame seed, a single juniper berry, and a single grain of ric
In this way he demonstrated hardships for six years without ever weakening his resolve
to demonstrate the accumulation of merit
The gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas who witnessed the qualities of the Bodhisattva watched over him day and night, making offerings and forming aspirations
“Living on roots, fruits, and leaves, They wear grass, mendicant’s robes, and skins. Still others wander naked
Such fools think they have grasped the only truth
Monks, during the six years that the Bodhisattva practiced austerities, he was continually followed by Māra, the evil one
To reply to Māra who said these words, The Bodhisattva said
Evil one, steeped in craziness! You have come here with ulterior motives
Ambition, greed, and wanting praise, Fame obtained through deception, Seeking to exalt oneself And put down others
This is the army of Māra, The evil friend who inflicts torment
Some ascetics and priests Appear to be caught up in that
With mindfulness as the foundation And knowledge as my training, I act carefully
So what will you now do, O feeble-minded one
With these acts and methods I have not been able to manifest any true knowledge that would be higher than manmade teachings
This path does not lead to awakening
This path is incapable of eradicating the continuation of birth, old age, and death in the future
That, indeed, must be the path to awakening, which can eradicate the arising of the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death
and he proclaimed, “I will now eat solid foods, such as molasses, pea soup, lentil soup, porridge, and rice
Based on this path and these practices, the mendicant Gautama appears unable to actualize an exalted wisdom vision that is any higher than manmade teachings
Yet how can eating solid foods and leading a comfortable life be of any help? What an ignorant and childish man
With this thought in mind, the companions left the Bodhisattva an
headed toward Vārāṇasī, where they set up camp at the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages
Monks, every day since the beginning of the Bodhisattva’s practice of austerities, the village girl Sujātā had offered food to eight hundred priests in the hope that the Bodhisattva would come out of his discipline and hardship and maintain his vital functions
As she did so, she offered the prayer, “May the Bodhisattva take my food and thereby truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening!
Friends, here is a descendent of a great royal clan. He has abandoned his kingdom of a universal monarch, and now he turns his mind to a dusty rag
What a sight! Friends, this is really amazing
All the sky gods heard the voice of the earth god, and they passed on the message to the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings
The gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings told the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. They in turn passed on the message to the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, and from there the message spread to the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, and finally all the way to the Brahma realm
at that time, at that moment, at that very instant
this message resounded and traveled all the way to Highest Heaven
The Bodhisattva then thought to himself
Monks, as soon as Sujātā, daughter of the villager Nandika, heard these words of the gods
she quickly gathered the milk of a thousand cows. Seven times she skimmed the cream from the milk, until she obtained a thick, strength-giving cream
She then poured this cream into a new clay pot, mixed it with the freshest rice, and placed it on a brand-new stove
As the milk porridge was cooking, various omens manifested
At that time a fortuneteller versed in ritual and the art of reading signs came to the village and prophesied that someone would attain immortality there
When she returned, Uttarā told her mistress what had happened
“Wherever I go, the only person I meet is that beautiful monk. Other than him, there are no monks or priests!
Sujātā said
he alone is the priest! It is for his sake that I have prepared this meal. Go, Uttarā, and fetch him
“Very well, my lady,” said Uttarā
and off she went. When she met the Bodhisattva, she bowed at his feet and conveyed Sujātā’s invitation to him
Sister, what should I do with the golden bowl
“Please take it with you,” she replied
So the Bodhisattva took the bowl and left Urubilvā. Before noo
he arrived at the banks of the Nairañjanā River, the river of nāgas
Monks, while the Bodhisattva was bathing, several hundred thousand gods came to venerate him. They poured divine aloe and sandalwood powder as well as various ointments into the river, and they scattered divine flowers of all colors onto the water
In this way the whole great Nairañjanā River flowed on full of divine perfumes and flowers that rained down
At that point the thousand-eyed Indra, the destroyer of cities, changed into a garuḍa with a diamond beak an
attempted to steal the golden bowl from the nāga king Sāgara. When Indra was unable to do so, he changed into his own form and requested it politely
he received the bowl, and he brought it back to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three in order to enshrine it in a memorial for the sake of worship
He now manifested the thirty-two and eighty marks of a great being as well as a halo of light, one fathom in diameter, around his body
He, the lion with the bearing of a swan and the gait of the supreme elephant, proceeds to the Bodhi tree
This concludes the eighteenth chapter, on the Nairañjanā River
the gait of a great being
a gait as stable as Mount Meru, the king of mountains
With such a stride the Bodhisattva set out for the seat of awakening
the stride of stainless peace, the stride that leads to the city of nirvāṇa, which is auspicious, stainless, and free from fear
Monks, on the stretch between the Nairañjanā River and the seat of awakening, the gods of wind clouds swept the road for the Bodhisattva, while the gods of rain clouds sprinkled his path with scented water, and scattered flowers along the way
Jewel ledges and beryl staircases surrounded the ponds
The ponds resounded with the calls of ducks, storks, swans, geese, cranes, and peacocks
and horses, elephants, and bulls circumambulated the Bodhisattva. Hundreds of thousands of parrots, mynas, cuckoos, partridge, swans, sandpipers, peacocks, and cakrāvaka birds were drawn into the Bodhisattva’s presence
He is utterly stainless, pure, and in possession of a very wholesome mind
He has become a master of all phenomena and is, in all his actions, beyond intentions
The Bodhisattva, who is like the great Brahmā, proceeds to the seat of awakening with the desire to awaken to unexcelled, perfect, and complete buddhahood in order to tame the armies of Māra
On that night, the very night when the Bodhisattva set his aim on attaining full and complete awakening
the all-powerful Brahmā, the ruler of the great trichiliocosm, called out to his large retinue in the Brahma realm
He has abandoned palaces with their oval windows and terraces, as well as conveyances, And the land adorned with exquisite flowers, with beautiful parks, springs, and ponds. He gave up his limbs, his head, and his eyes, and now he walks to the seat of awakening
Monks, the great Brahmā, who presides over the trichiliocosm, then made, in a single moment, all the worlds in the great trichiliocosm the same
The world had now become smooth, like the palm of a hand
When all the worldly guardians in the ten directions, such as Indra and Brahmā, saw how beautiful the world had become
they decided to venerate the Bodhisattva by adorning a hundred thousand buddha realms in the same way
They were so magnificent that when the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and demigods witnessed them, they began to conceive of their own abodes as nothing more than charnel grounds
These four deities of the Bodhi tree also wished to venerate the Bodhisattva, and therefore they modeled the Bodhi tree to give it perfect roots, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits, as well as a perfect height and circumference
It was beautiful, nice to behold, wide, and, with its height of eighty palm tree
All the vast worlds Now appeared as one. They could be seen as clearly as the palm of a hand
Composed of all kinds of jewels. In order to venerate the Bodhisattva, All realms were well adorned
It cleared away all disturbing emotions and brought joy, happiness, trust, and supreme enjoyment to all sentient beings
abode of Kālika, the king of nāgas
The light was pure and stainless and gave rise to joy as it satisfied the bodies and minds that it touched
Offer him the melodious sounds of song and music, and beat the finest drums. Go now! Make offerings to the benefactor who is worthy of everyone’s respect
Overjoyed with the Lord’s perfect qualities, the king of the nāgas joined his palms
Guide, in seeing you I have fortuitously obtained great prosperity; I have made offerings to you, spoken of your qualities, and strived for awakening
Monks, at this point Suvarṇa­prabhāsā, the chief queen of Kālika the nāga king, came to see the Bodhisattva. She was surrounded and escorted by many nāga girls, who were holding various types of cloth, parasols made of assorted jewels, different pearl necklaces, a variety of precious jewels, an array of garlands, a myriad of unguents and powders made by gods and humans, and containers with diverse perfumes
You are unerring, fearless, confident, and brave
Where did the previous thus-gone ones sit when they attained unsurpassed, genuine and perfect awakening
with the sweetest scent and the most beautiful color
His speech was uninterrupted, captivating, and pleasant to hear. It was affectionate, worthy to be remembered, encouraging, satisfying, and delightful
His words were not harsh. They were free from stammering, and they had no animosity. They were not erratic but smooth, gentle, sweet, and pleasant to the ear
Once I have conquered Māra and his armies
I will experience the peace of unexcelled awakening. “That peace, for the sake of which, for many thousands of eons, I have practiced generosity, constraint, renunciation, And ethical and disciplined conduct, as well as austerities— That peace will come to fruition today
Svastika, if it were possible to hand awakening to another being By making awakening into a lump of alms food, I would surely grant this to everyone! When I attain awakening, you should know that I will distribute immortality
Monks, as the Bodhisattva was walking toward the Bodhi tree
the gods and bodhisattvas realized that this was the moment when the Bodhisattva, having sat there, would attain awakening and become a truly perfect awakened one
like a lion
In the eastern direction this light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Lalitavyūha, who resided in the Vimala world in the Thus-Gone One Vimala­prabhāsa’s buddha realm
Surrounded and escorted by an infinite number of bodhisattvas
he proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva
he produced a miraculous manifestation whereby he was able to display all the buddha realms, in all directions to the end of space, as a single maṇḍala made of blue beryl
These sentient beings pointed their fingers at the Bodhisattva and asked each other
Who is that beautiful person
He who donated trillions of jewels, fragrant substances, and parasols To those without an equal who abide, their minds full of loving kindness, in the state of passing beyond suffering
the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Indrajālin, who resided in the Campakavarṇā world of the Thus-Gone One Puṣpāvali Vanarāji Kusumitābhijña’s buddha realm
he light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Vyūharāja, who resided in the Sūryāvartā world of the Thus-Gone One Candra­sūrya­jihmī­kara­prabha’s buddha realm
the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being Ratnasambhava, who resided in the Ratnasambhava world of the Thus-Gone One Ratnayaṣti’s buddha realm
he proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva
he emanated within the sacred area a limitless and boundless number of pavilions made of precious stones
He who has renounced the ocean and the land along with all precious objects, Who abandoned his palace with its fine oval windows and terraces, and also his harnessed carriages, Ornate pavilions, exquisite flowers and garlands, parks, wellsprings, and assembly halls, Giving up his feet, hands, head, and eyes
he now sits at the seat of awakening
Then, in the northwestern direction, the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Megha­kūṭābhigarjitasvara, who resided in the Meghavatī world of the Thus-Gone One Megharāja’s buddha realm
As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva, he emanated appearances of bodhisattvas, each adorned with the thirty-two marks, on each of the palaces and pavilions
n the quarter down below, the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Ratnagarbha, who resided in the Samanta­vilokitā world of the Thus-Gone One Samantadarśin’s buddha realm
At the center of the lotuses, one could see the upper body of many women
in perfect shape and appearance and adorned with various jewelry
In their hands they proffered many types of jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets, armbands, gold threads, and pearl necklaces
As they offered these along with flower garlands and silken tassels, they bowed in the direction of the seat of awakening and the Bodhisattva, and sang this verse
He always bowed to the buddhas, the hearers, The solitary buddhas, and his masters
Disciplined, mindful, joyful, and without pride, To him, who is full of qualities, you should bow down
the light encouraged the bodhisattva, the great being, Gagaṇagañja, who resided in the Varagaṇā world of the Thus-Gone One Gaṇendra’s buddha realm
he stood in the middle of the sky and brought down a rain of objects never before seen or heard of in any of the buddha realms in the ten directions
flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, ointments, powders, cloths, ornaments, parasols, banners, streamers, banners of victory, jewels, precious stones, gold, silver, pearls, horses, elephants, chariots, infantrymen, carriages, flowering trees, leaves, fruits, boys, girls, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, Indra, Brahmā, the world protectors, humans, and nonhumans
the offspring of the victorious ones from the ten directions Arrive to pay homage to the benefactor who has attained awakening
Some scatter a lattice of precious stones from the sky, Shining like the beautiful new moon
They throw māndārava flowers and garlands of campaka flowers Toward the Bodhisattva as he sits at the foot of the king of trees
Some arrive, making the earth shake with their two feet; The shaking ground amuses the people
Some arrive proffering ponds with blooming lotuses; They bring blue and white lotuses that have opened. At the center of each of the flowers, there are beings endowed with the thirty-two marks
Who praise the learned Bodhisattva and his undefiled mind
Some arrive with eyes blazing like the fire at the end of an eon, Showing the dissolution and the creation
Some arrive with lips as beautiful as the bimba fruit; Their perfect mouths speak with voices like the kiṃnaras
Some arrive with their faces like the sun or the full moon; Their rays of light and luster conquer the faults of disturbing emotions
Some arrive adorned with precious stones, holding jewels in their hands; With these gems they cover billions of realms
Some arrive with the treasury of the precious great dhāraṇīs; From the pores in their skin, hundreds of thousands of sūtras are heard. With their confidence, intelligence, and exalted minds, They cause realization in all proud and haughty beings
Some arrive holding the central mountain like a drum; Beating it, they fill the sky with sweet voices
Monks, in order to venerate the Bodhisattva
He, the Benefactor, will attain immortality, And bestow absorptions, higher knowledge, immortality, and happiness
When the Self-Arisen One, by his nature, pours down the rain of Dharma
You will not know what to do or where to go
The abode was filled with dust, and rough with scattered pebbles
He saw his abode being filled with darkness
Startled with fear and terror, he fled in the ten directions
He lost his diadem and his earrings fell off
His lips, throat, and mouth dried out
His heart was beating fast
The leaves, flowers, and fruits in his parks withered
His lotus ponds were emptied of water and dried out
All birds, such as swans, cranes, peacocks, cuckoos, kunālas, the two-headed pheasants, and so forth, had broken wings
All his musical instruments—such as his drum, conch, clay drum, hand drum, tambour, lute, harp, cymbals, and tambourines—broke, fell into pieces, then into shreds, and fell on the ground
His beloved kinfolk and retinue abandoned him, their faces cast down, while he stood aside and brooded
His chief queen, Māriṇī, fell from her bed onto the ground and started beating her head with her fists
Those among his sons who were the most diligent, powerful, glorious, and intelligent prostrated to the Bodhisattva, who was sitting at the supremely sacred seat of awakening
His daughters wailed and cried out, “Oh no, father, oh no, father!
He was dressed in stained clothes
With his head covered in dust and his face colorless and pale, he beheld himself as devoid of any vital force
His palace with its corridors, skylights, and porticoes became covered in dust and crumbled down
All his generals from the realms of the yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, and gandharvas placed their hands on their heads and fled while crying and wailing
Whatever divine regents there are among the gods in the desire realm—Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, Vaiśravaṇa, Śakra, Suyāma, Santuṣita, Sunirmāṇarati, Vaśavartin, and so forth—Māra, the evil one, saw all of them eagerly listening to the Bodhisattva with their faces turned toward him
In the midst of battle, his sword could not be pulled from its sheath, and he himself was unwell and wailing
His retinue abandoned him
His vases full of auspicious items fell into a hole
The priest Nārada pronounced a curse
The gatekeeper Ānandita cried out in distress
The canopy of the sky became covered in darkness
The goddess Śrī, who lives in the desire realm, began to weep
His faculties became ineffectual
He lost his allies
His lattices of jewels and pearls became silent, fell apart, tore, and fell down
His whole dwelling swayed
The trees and the turrets of his buildings tore and fell over
The entire army of Māra was felled in a confrontation
Monks, such were the thirty-two omens in the dream of Māra, the evil one
When Māra awoke from this dream, he was so terrified that he gathered all his family members
Today I heard these verses sung from the sky
and now has arrived at the Bodhi tree.’ You must make great effort
It may be best to give up and not go to war, which would bring humiliation
Māra replied
When he sees me and my retinue, He will be powerless but to rise and bow to my feet
When the time for battle has arrived, victory is of no bad consequence
Sārthavāha said
Some ate human flesh and drank blood, chewing on human arms, legs, heads, and livers, and slurping entrails, feces, and vomit
Their terrifying bodies had many colors, such as brown, blue, red, black, and blazing yellow
Others had eyes that were gouged out, eyes that were ablaze, or disfigured eye sockets
Some had ugly eyes, rolling and blazing
Some carried flaming mountains in their hands while playfully riding on other mountains as their mount
They would make snappy, ugly, terrifying, and rough sounds of “Phut phut, picut, phulu phulu!
Others would call, “Let’s get rid of him! Grab that mendicant Gautama along with his tree
Some had their heads pointing down and feet up. Some had needle-like hair on their heads
Others had hair like oxen, donkeys, boars, mongooses, goats, sheep, cats, monkeys, wolves, or jackals
In this way they came running, throwing their limbs in the air and rocking their bodies
They cried out loudly in laughter, slapped and beat their chests, and disheveled their hair
their heads flaming with the hair streaming upward
Running around impetuously, darting here and there with eyes like a fox, they tried to frighten the Bodhisattva
Old women approached the Bodhisattva and called out to him
Oh no, son
Just like this single army
so too the armies of hundreds of zillions of evil demons, residing in the great trichiliocosm, spread themselves around the Bodhisattva in horizontal and upward directions
Monks, among the one thousand sons of Māra, the evil one
there were some, such as Sārthavāha, who began to feel devotion toward me, the Bodhisattva
They all assembled on the right side of Māra, the evil one
Because of his love, the body of this sage Is inaccessible to poison, weapons, and fire. Since the love that he feels transcends the world
On the left side, someone named Ugratejas called out
But his vajra mind cannot possibly be burned By the likes of you, even if you were equal in number to the grains of sand in the Ganges
From the right side, Prasāda­pratilabdha said
You may proudly assume That you can crush with your hands All gods, demigods, and gandharvas, Along with the earth, the mountains, and the oceans
I will not rest until I have conquered the son of the Śākyas
From the right side, Dharmakāma said
When meeting wet grass, the fire retreats
When the arrow hits a mountain peak, it rebounds
The bolt of lightning, having hit the ground, sinks down. Until the Bodhisattva obtains peaceful immortality, he will not retreat
Father, even if one could draw pictures in the empty sky
In the three realms, there are fierce poison
In the form of attachment, anger, and delusion
He only delights in the pleasures of the Dharma, The bliss of concentration and the significance of immortality, And the joy of liberating sentient beings and the happiness of a loving mind
So what need is there to mention those who do not follow you, Brahmā and the luminous gods, And the gods of the pure realms— They, too, all bow to him
Venerate the Bodhisattva In accord with his essence
This army of yakṣas and other beings, Which extends for eighty leagues
Since he is neither taken aback nor stirred When seeing this wild and fierce army, So hideous and frightening
The past nightmares Will now come true. If you do not retreat
Have you not heard before That the one whose body blazes with all the marks And who walks away from his home Will conquer disturbing emotions and attain awakening
At that point, in order to weaken the strength of the demons, the Bodhisattv
Upon seeing the Bodhisattva’s face, Māra took flight. But while fleeing, he had the thought that his army could withstand the sight of the Bodhisattva’s face, and he once again turned back
Assisted by his followers, he now began to hurl various weapons upon the Bodhisattva
However, even when they threw mountains as big as the central mountain at the Bodhisattva, the mountains all turned into flower canopies and celestial palaces
Those with poisonous gazes, those with poisonous snakes, and those with poisonous breath shot flames of fire at the Bodhisattva
Yet this circle of fire just turned into what seemed to be the Bodhisattva’s halo of light
When he came back, the demons began to hurl all sorts of terrifying weapons at the Bodhisattva. They threw swords, arrows, darts, lances, axes, clubs, javelins, bludgeons, discuses, vajras, hammers, uprooted trees, rocks, lassos, and iron balls
However, as soon as the demons released the weapons, the weapons turned into garlands and canopies of flowers
With the intention to liberate sentient beings, I have often given beggars my house, wealth, grains, beds, clothes, and parks
Māra, the evil one, replied with this verse
Like a lion, he was without fear, fright, anxiety, timidity, disturbance, and perturbation
He had no goose bumps, which indicate fear
the hand that had the contours of a conch, a victory banner, a fish, a vase, a swastika, an iron hook, and a wheel
All this was the result of limitless eons of gathering the accumulations of basic goodness
He now let his right hand slide over his entire body and then gracefully tapped on the eart
This earth supports all beings; She is impartial and unbiased toward all, whether moving or still
Not far from where the Bodhisattva was sitting
she broke through the earth’s surface and revealed her upper body, adorned with all sorts of jewels
She bowed toward the Bodhisattva, joined her palms
You are right. Great Being, you are right
It is just as you say
We bear witness to this
But still, my Lord, you alone are the supreme witness in the worlds of gods and humans and the supreme authority
Having spoken thus, the earth goddess Sthāvarā rebuked Māra, the evil one, in many ways, and praised the Bodhisattva again and again
Just like jackals in the forest hearing the lion’s roar, Or crows taking flight when a rock is thrown
Still, even though he was miserable and ashamed of himself, he was overpowered by pride to such an extent that he could not leave; he could not turn back and flee. Therefore, he turned to his men and spoke
All of you! Wait a whil
until we find out whether it is possible to arouse the Bodhisattva by polite persuasion. Such a jewel of a being should not be killed outright
Some stripped off all their clothes and jewelry
Some laughed, played, and had fun, trying to attract each other’s attention
But then they again pretended to be shy
or the sun rising in the early dawn, or a golden pillar, or a blooming thousand-petaled lotus, or a sacrificial fire sprinkled with oil
Like the king of mountains he was immutable, confident, unconfused, and untroubled. Since he had totally abandoned, all by himself, all disturbing emotions through his well-established intelligence and wisdom
It is the deluded people with childish minds, not the wise ones, Who mistakenly perceive the body as beautiful
When seeing that sensual enjoyments are without good qualities
And that they lead away from the noble path of wisdom
And that they are the same as poisonous plants or fires, or like angry vipers
Only fools would call them ‘happiness.
Whoever becomes a slave of women through desir
If he discards his joy in the Dharma and delights in desire
Will stray from discipline, from concentration, and lose common sense. Wallowing in pleasure, he will be far removed from wisdo
Of what use is the dress of a sage to you? Give that up and enjoy pleasures instead
Until I attain perfect freedom and immortality, so difficult to attain
Relish playing with us—it will bring great pleasure
Look at these beautiful trees with fresh leaves and blooming flowers; They resound with the cries of pheasants, cuckoo birds, and the humming of bees
All of these trees produce shoots and flowers according to seasons
I see the body as impure, filled with masses of worms
Yet I will attain that imperishable state, venerated by the wise, The state that brings ultimate happiness to the animate and inanimate worlds
May your wishes and vows, which you have made in hundreds of lives, be fulfilled
Now that you yourself have crossed, please liberate all suffering beings
Monks, at that point the eight goddesses dwelling in the tree of awakening—Śrī, Vṛddhi, Tapā, Śreyasī, Vidu, Ojobalā, Satyavādinī, and Samaṅginī
honored the Bodhisattva, glorified him evoking the sixteen types of splendor, and praised him
Monks, in this way the goddesses in the Bodhi tree glorified the Bodhisattva evoking the sixteen types of magnificence
Monks, at that moment the gods of the pure realms tried to discourage Māra in sixteen different ways
I rule over gods, demigods, humans, and animals; All of them fall under my control
Not knowing the truth, they preached the existence of a soul, Variously claiming that this soul is all-pervasive, confined to locations, eternal, With form, without form, with qualities, without qualities,  An agent, and not an agent. This is what they claimed
But today, sitting here on this seat, I will attain stainless awakening; I will defeat you, Māra, and repel your army and soldiers
Catch that Gautama, who sits alone in the wilderness, and bring him quickly to me
The powerful army of demons came forth
With wild cries, playing conches and various drums, they asked
Not even someone who can destroy the trichiliocosm and count its motes of dust
Not even someone who can split the supreme diamond mountain in a single instant
No one can harm me here beneath this tree
There is no eye, no man, no woman, and no self; There is no ear, no nose, no tongue, and no body
The buddhas in the ten directions are my witnesses; My discipline, practice, and the superior branches of awakening are all my witnesses
Generosity, discipline, and patience are my witnesses
Diligence, concentration, and knowledge,  The four limitless contemplations, and the five higher knowledges are my witnesses
With all their strength of merit, discipline, and wisdom, And all their many unrestricted sacrifices, They do not equal even a hundredth of the qualities in a single hair of mine
Parents, children, sisters, and brothers asked about them: “Where were they seen? Where have they gone
The leaders of gods, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and rākṣasas, Brahmā, Indra, and the gods in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations And the Heaven of Joy al
proclaimed his victory and called out, “You have conquered Māra’s army! Hero of the World, be victorious!
At this supreme seat, you have conquered with love the wicked army of demons. Hero, today you shall attain awakening
There were  million beings who witnessed The power and might of a perfect bodhisattva
And  million who formed the wish for the perfect awakening of a buddha
Monks, once the Bodhisattva had destroyed his demonic opponents, vanquished his enemies, triumphed in the face of battle, and raised high the parasols, standards, and banners of conquest
he settled into the first meditative concentration
That state is free from desires
free of factors connected with evil deeds and nonvirtues
accompanied by thought and analysis
and imbued with the joy and pleasure born of discernment
When he had brought about the cessation of thought and analysis, he became perfectly quiet in and of himself, and therefore his mind became concentrated
Through this he settled into the second meditative concentration, which is free of thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and pleasure born of meditative absorption
Through relinquishing pleasure at that moment, and having formerly relinquished pain in the past, both mental pleasure and displeasure vanished
Thus he settled into the fourth meditative concentration, which is perfectly pristine impartiality and mindfulness, unconnected with pleasure or pain
While the Bodhisattva’s mind—purified and cleansed, lucid, free of basic and subsidiary afflictions, gentle, adaptable, and immovable—was immersed in this way
in the early station of the night he produced the intent to actualize the knowledge that sees wisdom with the divine eye, and so he directed his mind toward that purpose
The Bodhisattva, with the pristine divine eye beyond that of humans
looked at sentient beings. He saw them dying and being born, in all their beauty and ugliness, in favorable and unfavorable circumstances
degenerating or advancing precisely in accordance with their actions. With this understanding he thought
Yet other sentient beings engage in positive physical, verbal, and mental conduct
they do not revile noble ones
Harboring the correct view
Since they engage in the actions associated with the correct view, once their bodies collapse and they die, they are born into pleasant existences in the god realms
Then, while his mind—purified and cleansed, lucid, free of basic and subsidiary afflictions, supple, flexible, and immovable—was immersed in this way
in the middle station of the night the Bodhisattva produced the intent to actualize the knowledge that sees the wisdom of recollecting past lives, and so he directed his mind toward that purpose
In this way he recollected the previous lives of himself and other sentient beings
starting with one, two, three, four, and five lifetimes, then ten, twenty, thirty, forty, an
fifty more lifetimes, then one hundred lifetimes, one thousand lifetimes, one hundred thousand lifetimes, then many hundreds of thousands of lifetimes, ten million lifetimes, a billion lifetimes, ten billion lifetimes, a trillion lifetimes, and a quadrillion lifetimes, then several billion, several tens of billions, several trillions, and several quadrillions of lifetimes
and several eons of both destruction and formation
He remembered the former lives of himself and others in the greatest detail
during the final station of the night, just at the break of dawn, right at the time of night when the morning drum is beaten
the Bodhisattva produced the intent to actualize the knowledge that brings suffering and its origin to an end and realizes the insight that exhausts defilements, and so he directed his mind to that purpose
What must be absent for birth not to happen? What must be prevented to eliminate birth
Monks, on that occasio
I accurately understood four truths. I understood:  the defiled is suffering,  the source of the defiled,  how the defiled is brought to cessation, and  the path that leads to the cessation of the defiled
the defilement of desire
the defilement of craving
these defilements come to an end without leaving any residue
the precise identity of craving, the source of craving, the cessation of craving, and the path leading to its cessation
the precise identity of feeling, the source of feeling, the cessation of feeling, and the path leading to its cessation
the precise identity of clinging, the source of clinging, the cessation of clinging, and the path leading to its cessation
the precise identity of existence, the source of existence, the cessation of existence, and the path leading to its cessation
the precise identity of birth, the source of birth, the cessation of birth, and the path leading to its cessation
the precise identity of old age, the source of old age, the cessation of old age, and the path leading to its cessation
I accurately understood precisely how this massive heap of pure suffering, with its anguish, lamentation, pain, despair, and torment comes into being and how it ceases
I accurately understood the precise identity of suffering, the source of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to its cessation
Thus, monks, sure enough, during the final station of night, just at the break of dawn, right at the time for the beating of the morning drum, the Bodhisattv
the being, the good being
reached unexcelled, perfect and complete awakening, attaining the threefold knowledge
He did so through knowledge that consists of one-pointed insight into everything that might be known, understood, attained, realized, and actualized via the wisdom of the noble ones
and while seated ther
This is called the end of suffering
The path has been interrupted
the unexcelled charioteer among me
the indeterminate were accepted
which illuminated the immeasurable and innumerable worlds throughout the ten directions
Then the bodhisattvas and gods throughout the ten directions uttered an expression of joy
The gentle rain of Dharma, medicine to living beings, Will cause all the seeds of the roots of virtue to sprout, Bring growth to the saplings of faith, And yield the fruits of liberation
Well done, Great Being! You overpowered the demonic hordes And attained the sublime state, deathless and free of anguish
Parasols were carried by the buddhas of one hundred billion realms
The best of beings throughout the ten directions extended their arm
And said in the voice of a cuckoo’s call
Just as we attained awakening, you too have reached the pristine state
We are just like butter and clarified butter
Then the goddesses of the desire realm perceived that the Thus-Gone One on the seat of awakening had attained higher knowledge, fulfilled his purpose, and become victorious in battle
Such was the play of the Lion among Men while he sat in his seat
This concludes the twenty-second chapter, on perfect and complete awakening
With the torch of your insight, You can awaken This long-slumbering world, Shrouded in the fog of darkness
Into the world of the living, Chronically troubled with the disease of afflictions, You have come, O King of Physicians, To cure the world of all illnesses
Those who seek to behold you, O Gentle Bull among Men, Will never go to the lower realms For thousands of eons
Those who listen to the Dharm
Will become scholars and be free of illness
They will be profound and bring an end to the aggregates, And be free from fear
then the luminous gods paid homage to the Thus-Gone One sitting at the seat of awakening with a plethora of flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, unguents, parasols, standards, and flags. When the offerings had been made
they circumambulated him three times and then praised him with these verses
Monks, once the luminous gods had praised the Thus-Gone One so, they bowed to him with palms joined and stood to one side
Then the gods from the Brahma realm, led by the son of gods, Subrahman
covered the Thus-Gone One sitting at the seat of awakening with a jewel net studded with many trillions of gems
Monks, once the gods of the Brahma realm, led by the god Subrahman, had praised the Thus-Gone One with these verses, they bowed to him with palms joined and stood to one side
Then those sons of Māra who were on the side of righteousness approached the Thus-Gone One and covered him with giant jewel parasols and canopies
Then with palms joined, they praised the Thus-Gone One with these fitting verses
When we, the dreadful army of Māra, appeared before you
In your vast power, you vanquished instantaneously our terrifying demonic horde, Without rising, moving, or saying a word
While pursuing the conduct of supreme awakening
You gave up your dearest wives, beloved sons, servants, gardens, towns, Your cities, kingdoms, harems, and elephants,  Your heads, eyes, tongues, and feet
that is why you shine today
As a buddha, wearing the armor of concentration, miraculous power, and intelligence, I mysel
will ferry across trillions of beings, swept away in the ocean of suffering, In the ship of the sublime Dharma
This aspiration that you repeatedly voiced Is now fulfilled, and you will liberate all beings
Then a god from the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, surrounded and escorted by millions of gods
sprinkled the Thus-Gone One with golden lotuses from the Jambū River
Then, in his presence, they praised him with these verses
Through the path of the previous victorious ones, you eradicate all illnesses of beings
The lingering symptoms of false belief, affliction, and ignorance that has accumulated
Monks, once the god Santuṣita and his entourage had praised the Thus-Gone One, with palms joine
they bowed to him and sat to one side
Then the gods from the Heaven Free from Strife, led by the god Suyāma, went to where the Thus-Gone One was seated
Once the gods from the Heaven Free from Strife, led by the god Suyāma, had praised the Thus-Gone One, with palms joine
they bowed to the Thus-Gone One and then stood to one side
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, together with the gods from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, paid homage to the Thus-Gone One with a display of flowers, incense, garlands, unguents, parasols, standards, and flags
then praised him with these verses
Your work to achieve awakening, exalted by the force of your perseverance, was infinite
Your powers—the powers of your insight, skillful means, love, and great merit— Were already infinite, O Blessed One, when you set out for the state of awakening
Thus you have the strength of the ten powers today on the seat of awakening
Seeing the infinite hordes of armies, the gods became anxious and frightened, Lest the King of Mendicants in repose at the seat of awakening should be troubled
But the spirits did not frighten you, nor could they move your body
Rather your hand struck hard, shaking them, and you defeated Māra’s army
Monks, once Śakra, lord of the gods, together with the gods from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, had praised the Thus-Gone One, with palms joine
they bowed to the Thus-Gone One and sat to one side
You whose speech is exceedingly melodious and whose cadence is captivating
People here have profited well Since such a being has appeared in the world
Like the goddess of wealth who is the giver of riches, You will bestow your Dharma throughout the whole world
They offered him jewel parasols, jewel banners, jewel and silk brocade wreaths, ornate jewel earrings, flower wreaths, and pearl strands of various types held by gods who revealed the upper half of their bodies, as well as crescent moons
The gods bestrew you with them, yet they are not mixed together
The whole sky is filled with gods
Once the gods of the sky had so praised the Thus-Gone One in repose at the seat of awakening, they joined palms an
bowed to him and stood to one side
Then the terrestrial gods, in order to pay homage to the Thus-Gone One, cleansed and anointed the entire surface of the earth, sprinkled it with perfumed water
If you, Lion among Men, do not consecrate the entire trichiliocosm
Then the whole thing will collapse With the violent shock of the arrival of bodhisattvas, The soles of whose feet will cause ten million realms to quake
Wherever the most sublime being happens to walk
An illustrious gift is gained by the terrestrial god
Should we take hold of all the lands of the trichiliocosm— All the myriad hundreds of thousands of subterranean bodies of water, And all the myriad livelihoods of beings in those places
We would offer it all to you. May you use it according to your wishes
Wherever you shall sit, travel, or rest, And wherever the hearers, who are the children of the Bliss-Gone Gautama
Monks, while the Thus-Gone One was being praised by the gods after he had reached perfect and complete awakening
he stared at the king of trees without blinking and without getting out of his cross-legged position
Seven days passed in this way while he was at the foot of the Bodhi tree experiencing bliss from the sustenance of concentration and joy
The gods from the form realm also approached the Thus-Gone One, carrying tens of thousands of vases containing scented water
When they arrived, they bathed the Bodhi tree and the Thus-Gone One with the scented water
Monks, thus addressed
the Thus-Gone One answered the god
Array of the food of joy, O divine son, is the name of the meditative absorption in which the Thus-Gone One remained for seven days without moving from the cross-legged position
To your feet, replete with splendor, I bow down
When he bowed to the feet of the Bliss-Gone One, The god became delighted
He said this, which was soothing to gods and humans, And removed their doubt
You give joy to the Śākya clan; You bring an end to attachment, anger, and delusion
You bring the culmination of all wishes; Please dispel the doubts of gods and humans
You have gained immeasurable omniscience
A buddha with the ten powers. So, Victorious One, why do you remain at the center of the eart
In the cross-legged pose for seven days
With your eyes that are like blooming hundred-petaled lotuse
As you gaze, O Lion among Men, With your unblinking and pristine eyes
That makes you remain cross-legged For seven days at the king of trees
Is it your aspiratio
Or is it common to all the lions of speech
Here the belief in ‘I’ and ‘mine’ And its tangle of faults, With roots that extend far, knotted tight with obscurations
Has been severed by the blade of wisdom
The dualistic delusions, erroneous fixations
Which eventually land one in hell, I have removed here So that they are certain never to arise again
The harmful garland of thoughts Strung on the thread of conceptions
I have utterly reversed With the rosaries of the branches of awakening
And the forty misdeeds I eliminated here at the center of the earth
The sixteen uncontrolled things, The eighteen elements, And the twenty-five pains I eliminated while sitting at the center of the earth
The twenty streams of passion And the twenty-eight fears of being
I utterly transcended Through the force and commitment of my perseverance
Likewise five hundred roars of buddhas I perfectly comprehended here
Phenomena, one hundred thousand strong, I also perfectly comprehended
Here all the ninety-eight latent formations, Down to the bottom of their roots And all their sprouting shoots, Were burned up by the fire of my wisdom
The reservoir of doubt and uncertainty, Filled with the waters of view
From the river of craving—the fount of nonvirtue— Is dried up by the sun of my wisdom
And burned it up with the fire of my discipline
Here, through the medicine of wisdom most sublime, I purged myself of the root of conflict That induces the nausea of the lower realms— Namely, disparaging remarks made toward noble ones
Here I cut down with the ax of mindfulness The entire dense jungle of afflictions, Teeming with the trees of existence and overgrown with the roots of concepts, And burned it up with the fire of my wisdom
Here I cleansed the eye of wisdom, Naturally pure in all beings
With the great balm of insight, I removed the thick cataract of delusion
Here, with the gusts of fierce determination, I drove away and dispersed The cloud of latent formations, With its lightning of proclivities and its thunder of concepts
Here I attained the absorption of pristine mindfulness And struck down with a strong blow of the sword of knowledge The enemies of conceptual mind and actions, And the hostile way they reinforce existence
Here, having acquired love, I vanquished The armies of persistent demon hordes With disfigured shapes, bearing the highest crests On chariots mighty with elephants and horses
Here I fastened down The horse of the six sense fields, Engorged with the five sense objects and ever careless with intoxication
Here I reached the end Of infatuation and aggression, The travails of conflicts and disputes
Here I exhausted all conceits, Thoughts, and concepts, Rooted inside of me and out
All the pleasures of gods and humans, Up to the peak of existence
Here I relinquished, without exception
Here, at the trunk of the king of trees, I severed with the blow of impermanence The unfoldings of different karmas, All rooted in the six sense fields
Here, with the sun of wisdom, I dispelled the fog of delusion, debased with impurities, Thick with views of arrogance and anger, Thus illuminating what was darkened for so long
Here, with the boat of tenacity, I crossed the great ocean of cyclic existence With its crocodiles of passion and desire, Its waves of craving, and its grasping at wrong views
Here I awakened to the realizatio
That scorches desire, anger, delusion, And mental concepts
Oppressed for so long— For billions of countless eons— On the road of cyclic existence, Here I am revived, my torment now quelled
Here I have reached the city of fearlessness, Where suffering born of craving by means of sensory experience, And suffering based on the aggregates, Will arise no more
Here I understood what was realized By innumerable victorious ones in the past
About which sweet and pleasing words Are exclaimed throughout the world
That is why I now get out of the cross-legged posture
Here I rent asunder The closed doors of the five obstructions And cut through the vines of craving
Then this moon among men Rose slowly from his seat
Accepted the ceremonial anointment, And took his seat on a lion throne
Monks, the perfect and completely awakened Thus-Gone One thus sat for the first seven days on that very seat, thinking, “Here I have reached unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening. Here I have brought an end to the sufferings of beginningless birth, old age, and death.
During the second week
the Thus-Gone One wandered far and wide throughout the entire trichiliocosm
During the third week
the Thus-Gone One gazed at the seat of awakening without blinking and thought, “Here I awakened to unsurpassable, perfect and complete buddhahood, bringing an end to the sufferings of beginningless birth, old age, and death.
Evil one, I will not pass into parinirvāṇa until my elder monks have become restrained, lucid, proficient, courageous, and learned; until they have embarked on the Dharma in an authentic way and become masters themselves; and until they can overcome opponents in concordance with the Dharma and teach the Dharma in conjunction with miracles
Evil one, I will not pass away into parinirvāṇa until the tradition of the Buddha, his teaching, and his community are well established in the world; and until infinite bodhisattvas are prophesied to reach unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening
As soon as Māra, the evil one, had heard these words, he stepped aside and stood there anguished and depressed
Dejected, with his head hung low, he wrote on the ground with a stick, “He has gone beyond my range!
Then three of Māra’s daughters—Rati, Arati, and Tṛṣṇā—spoke this verse to Māra, the evil one
Father, why are you unhappy
So cast off your bad mood! You are going to be elated
But Māra, the evil one, replied
asked the Thus-Gone One for forgiveness, saying
“Bliss-Gone One, please forgive our offense! Blessed One, forgive the offense That we childish, stupid, uncultivated, unskilled, ignorant women Committed with the wish to insult the Blessed One!
You want to scrape through a mountain with your fingernails, Chew through iron with your teeth, Penetrate a mountain with your head, And measure an unfathomable depth
Monks, during the fifth week
the Thus-Gone One dwelt in the domain of the nāga king Mucilinda
Since the weather that week was intemperate
the nāga king Mucilinda, worried that the Blessed One’s body would be harmed by the cold and the wind, came out of his abode
On the way, on the bank of the Nairañjanā River between the nāga king Mucilinda’s domain and the goat herder’s banyan tree
the Thus-Gone One was spotted by some carakas, parivrājakas, vṛddhaśrāvakas, gautamas, nirgranthas, ājīvikas, and others as well
Happy is the subjugation of selfishness and pride. These are indeed the supreme forms of happiness
They brought out the two bullocks Sujāta and Kīrti
but they also would move no farther, even though they were goaded with bunches of lotuses and garlands of jasmine. S
The Thus-Gone One then revealed his saffron robes
“This person in saffron-colored robes is a renunciant, so he is no threat to us.
It must be mealtime for this renunciant. What morsels do we have
He understood that it was alms bowls made of stone
and so that thought dawned in the Thus-Gone One’s mind
Then the great king Vaiśravaṇa said to the three other great kings
Friends, the time has now come To offer a vessel to Śākyamuni
Paying homage with the melodious sound of song and cymbals, We will offer the begging bowls
Then the four kings, together with their kinfolk and retainers, went to the Thus-Gone One holding those alms bowls in their hands and carrying flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, and unguents, playing cymbals and gongs, and singing songs
Having paid homage to the Thus-Gone One, they filled the alms bowls with divine flowers and offered them to the Thus-Gone One
The four miraculous gods are now giving me These four well-formed alms bowls
Like Mount Meru, the Sage sat there unshakable, Absorbed in concentration and meditation
which the herdsmen brought to the two merchants, Trapuṣa and Bhallika, saying
O my lords, please advise us! When we milked all your cows, they yielded clarified butter
Is this auspicious or not
Some priests, who were gluttonous by nature, said
“It is inauspicious, so a grand offering of this butter should be made to the priests.
Monks, at that time, however, a priest named Śikhaṇḍī spoke. He had been a kinsman of the merchants Trapuṣa and Bhallika in a previous life
He had been reborn in the Brahma realm, and now manifested among them in the form of a young brahmin
‘When the Thus-Gone One reaches awakening, May he partake of our food And turn the wheel of Dharma!
This aspiration has now been fulfilled
They cleaned, polished, and sanitized A jewel bowl called Moon, Which cost one hundred thousand coins for just one ounce
Then filled it to the brim with food
May divine auspiciousness, which accomplishes aims And brings good fortune throughout the ten directions
Fulfill all your aims! May everything promptly be favorable
May these seven constellations, Renowned world protectors, The gods that dwell in the east, Fully protect you
Their lord and king Is known as Dhṛtarāṣṭra
May this lord of all gandharvas, Together with the sun, protect you
May his many sons, wise and mighty
All ninety-one of whom are called Indra, Especially protect you With health and well-being
There are eight goddesses
May the constellations in that direction Protect you
Kṛttikā and Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśirā, Ardra, and Punarvasu, Puṣya, and Aśleṣā— These are the constellations in the east
Śriyāmatī and Yaśamatī, Yaśaprāptā and Yaśodharā, “Suutthitā and Suprathamā, Suprabuddhā and Sukhavyūhā
Their lord and king Is called Virūḍhaka
May that lord of all kumbhāṇḍas, Together with the lord of death, protect you
Alambuśā and Miśrakeśī, Puṇḍarīkā and Āruṇā, “Ekādaśā, Navanāmikā, Śītā, and Kṛṣṇā Draupadī
If for some reason You should travel to the north, May the constellations in that direction Protect you
Those seven constellations
There are seven: Dhaniṣṭhā, Śatabhiṣā, The pair of Pūrva Aparā and Uttara Aparā, Revatī and Aśvinī and Bharaṇī
Ilādevī and Surādevī, Pṛthvī and Padmāvatī, “Mahārājā, Āśā, Śraddhā, and modest Śirī
May they especially protect you With health and well-being
In a section of the north is Mount Gandhamādana
Always lovingly protected by Brahmā and Vāsava, And by those free of outflows whose minds are liberated, And also by the nāgas and yakṣas
This concludes the twenty-fourth chapter, on Trapuṣa and Bhallika
he had the following thought about the conventions of the world
Alas! This truth that I realized and awakened to is profound, peaceful, tranquil, calm, complete, hard to see, hard to comprehend, and impossible to conceptualize since it is inaccessible to the intellect
It is a state of complete peace, free of clinging, free of grasping, unobserved, undemonstrable, uncompounded, beyond the six sense fields
undemonstrable, uncompounded, beyond the six sense fields, inconceivable, unimaginable, and ineffable. It is indescribable, inexpressible, and incapable of being illustrated. It is unobstructed, beyond all references, a state of interruption through the path of tranquility
Profound, peaceful, stainless, lucid, and unconditioned— Such is the nectar-like truth I have realized
The ineffable state, untainted by language, Suchness, the sky-like nature of phenomena
There is neither existence nor nonexistence here
But I did not attain forbearance In which there is no self, no sentient being, and no life force. “When I attained this forbearance That nobody dies or is born here, That the nature of all these phenomena is to be without self
Then Buddha Dīpaṃkara made a prophecy about me
Monks, then the Great Top-Knotted Brahmā, surrounded and escorted by six million eight hundred thousand Brahmās
went to the Thus-Gone One
When he arrived, he bowed his head to the feet of the Thus-Gone One
Thus-Gone One, even having awakened to unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening, you are bent on keeping the Dharma to yourself without teaching it. Alas, Blessed One! This world is doomed
Through this merit, may I also swiftly Turn the wheel of Dharma, most sublime
Monks, while the Thus-Gone One was seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree, in the privacy of solitude after he had first attained perfect and complete awakening
a state of interruption through the path of tranquility, and imperceptible like emptiness
profound, subtle, luminous
And so when the night had passed, Śakra, Brahmā, the earth gods, the sky gods, and the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the Heaven Free from Strife, the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, the Brahma Realm, the Luminous Heaven, the Heaven of Great Fruition, the Heaven of Perfected Virtue, and the pure realms—many hundreds of thousands of divinities of beautiful appearance
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, bowed down with palms joined in the direction of the Thus-Gone One an
praised him in verse
Your mind is completely liberated, Like a full moon free of eclipse
May you rise, O Victor in Battle! May you shine the light of insight in this dark world
Monks, when Great Top-Knotted Brahmā and Śakra, lord of the gods
understood that the Thus-Gone One would remain silent
these two great beings and their retinue of gods, saddened and dejected, disappeared then and there
Some said that rains would no longer fall, some that rivers would no longer flow, and some that crops would no longer grow
You, Clever Bull, give rise to ardor And rescue those who have fallen into steep ravines
An encounter with you, O Sage, is always so long in coming
Monks, the Thus-Gone One then looked throughout the entire world with his awakened eye an
those of good disposition and  easy to purify, those of bad disposition and difficult to purify
those that can understand through just a cursory statement, and those for whom the words are paramoun
when a person standing on the bank of a lotus pond sees some lotuses submerged in the water, some lotuses at water level, and some lotuses above the water
this was how the Thus-Gone One saw sentient beings situated in three groups when he looked throughout the whole world with his awakened eye
Ecstatic and elated
he bowed with his head to the feet of the Thus-Gone One and vanished right there
Friends, today the venerable, perfectly and completely awakened Thus-Gone One has acquiesced to turn the wheel of Dharma
He will do this to benefit many beings, to bring happiness to many beings, to compassionately care for the world, for the welfare, betterment, and happiness of gods, humans, and the majority of beings
Listen, friends! The demigod realms will be reduced
The god realms will be filled
And many sentient beings in the world will reach complete nirvāṇa
Once the gods of the atmosphere heard this from the earth gods, they announced it to the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings
The gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings told those in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. The gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three told those in the Heaven Free from Strife. The gods in the Heaven Free from Strife told those in the Heaven of Joy and the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations. The gods in the Heaven of Joy and the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations told those in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Finally they announced and proclaimed this to the gods of the Brahmā realms
Monks, then the four gods of the Bodhi tree named Dharmaruci, Dharmakāya, Dharmamati, and Dharmacāri
Monks, to their question the Thus-Gone One replied
At the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages, outside of Vārāṇasī
teeming with many people and creatures, and adorned with gardens, forests, and mountains
all his fetters had been cut
So the Thus-Gone One wondered, “Where would he be now?
Monks, they have already practiced and they already possess pure qualities of accomplished scholars
Just as when the ripe fruit of the tāla tree is nipped off its stem, the severed area immediately becomes yellow, bright, and perfectly pure
so too, Gautama, are your bright senses and your perfectly pure round face
Just as a necklace made of gold from the Jambū River
Among the gods, demigods, and divine spirits, There is no rival to me
Now, monks, since the Thus-Gone One wanted to cross the river
he approached a ferryman about this
Gautama, you must pay the crossing fee
When the boatman saw this, he felt great regret, thinking
“Oh no, how sad! How could I refuse to give a ferry ride to such a venerable man worthy of being served!” He then fainted and fell to the ground
Your Majesty, when I asked the mendicant Gautama to pay the crossing fee
Instead he just flew through the air from one bank to the other
At dawn he dressed, put on his mendicant robe, and took his alms bowl
The five companions could see the Thus-Gone One approaching from a distance
Venerable ones, look, here comes that mendicant Gautama, that lazy, gluttonous one who has given up on his ascetic practices
How much worse are things now! He is not to be emulated as he walks around eating proper food and doing easy practices.  That lazy glutton! None of us should approach him to greet him or rise when he comes
‘Venerable Gautama, these are spare seats. If you like, you may sit.
So the closer the Thus-Gone One came to the five companions, the more overwhelming his splendor and radiance became
They began to quiver in their seats, and then their prior plan fell apart completely and they all stood up from their seats
One went to greet him. One approached him and held his robe and alms bowl
One prepared a seat for him
One made a footrest
One brought water to wash his feet and said
“Welcome, Venerable Gautama! Welcome, Venerable Gautama! Please sit on this seat that we have laid out.
The Thus-Gone One answered the five companions
Monks, I am the awakened one, the omniscient one, the all-seeing one. I have become tranquil and have exhausted all faults
Monks, being the master of phenomena, I will teach you the Dharma. Come, listen and understand
Listen intently with open ears, and I will give you instruction and guidance
When I teach and guide you, you will also relinquish all faults and be liberated within a stainless and insightful state of mind
Did you not, monks, earlier say to yourselves: ‘Venerable ones, look, here comes that mendicant Gautama, that lazy, gluttonous one who has given up on his ascetic practices
The color and brilliance of this light even outshone that of the sun and the moon, those magical planets that are otherwise so highly praised for their great power. The light shone so brightly that it illuminated even places so dark that those beings who are born there cannot see their hands, even if they hold them right in front of their faces
At that point one could hear all sorts of pleasant and cheerful sounds. There were sounds that inspired love and made everyone serene. There were inviting and refreshing sounds impossible to describe or imitate, agreeable sounds that do not produce fear
At that moment even the light of the sun and moon and the splendor of the gods, such as Śakra, Brahmā, and the world protectors, could not be perceived anymore
All beings who were living in the hells along with those born as animals and all those in the world of the lord of death became instantaneously free from suffering and filled with every happiness
No being had any emotion, such as hatred, delusion, envy, jealousy, pride, hypocrisy, arrogance, wrath, malice, or burning anguish
At that moment all sentient beings felt love for each other
If you seek the Dharma that he discovered, You should come in a hurry To listen to the Dharma
For one who renounces all mad carelessness
Once the great divine voice had called the gods
They at once abandoned their wealth And all appeared By the side of the Thus-Gone One
Monks, in order for the Thus-Gone One to turn the wheel of Dharma at the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages in Vārāṇasī, the earth gods now formed a great circle around the Thus-Gone One. The circle was wonderful and beautiful to the eye
accompanied by this request: “Please consider us with love and take your seat on this throne. We pray that the Blessed One will then turn the wheel of Dharma.
and the other ones with the title of ‘great lord,
May the Blessed One now turn the wheel of Dharma for the benefit and happiness of many beings, for the love of the world, for the well-being and happiness of great numbers of beings, both gods and humans. Bliss-Gone One, please make this offering of Dharma
please shower the rain of Dharma
From everywhere in this trichiliocosm, Brahmā, Śakra, and many guardians appeared. Bowing their heads to the Victorious One, they said
They offered the Bliss-Gone One manifold and vast offerings and praised his qualities. Then they made this request to his compassionate being
For human beings, tormented by the hundred diseases of disturbing emotions, Victorious Physician, please turn the supreme wheel of Dharma and liberate beings
Seeking the awakening of the victorious ones, you joyfully relinquished your fortune, Riches, treasures, gold, fine robes, beautiful flowers, ointments, scented powders, Finest dwellings, your retinue of consorts, the kingdom, even your beloved son
Perfect Buddha, please turn the supreme wheel
Monks, at that point a bodhisattva, a great being, known as the One Who Turns the Wheel When the Intent Is Formed
It was strewn with flowers of the heavens, adorned with fragrant garlands, and rubbed with perfumed ointments. In this way it was a wheel as beautiful as can be
It came about through the power of previous aspirations made as the Bodhisattva had trained. It was truly a suitable offering to the Thus-Gone One
self-indulgence, which is shallow, worldly, ordinary
Monks, the Bliss-Gone One teaches the Dharma by showing the middle way that does not fall into either of the two extremes
correct view, intention,  speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration
Monks, there are also four truths of the noble ones
This is what we call suffering
What is the origin of suffering? It is the craving that perpetuates existence, which is attended upon by the passion for enjoyment, and which finds pleasures here and there
That is the origin of suffering
What is the cessation of suffering
It is the complete and dispassionate cessation of craving that perpetuates existence, which is attended upon by the passion for enjoyment, and which finds pleasures here and there
This is the cessation of suffering
Monks, this teaching I had not heard previously. I understood it by intensely and introspectively focusing my mind on suffering
In this way my wisdom, vision, understanding, intellect, intelligence, knowledge, and insight became manifest
Monks, this teaching I had not heard previously. I understood it by focusing intently on the origin of suffering
Monks, this teaching I had not heard previously. I understood it by focusing intently on the cessation of suffering
With the melody of Brahmā and the voice of a kiṃnara, Emanating trillions of light rays, He, who had cherished the truth for many millions of eons
The Self-Arisen Śākyamuni, spoke these words to Kauṇḍinya
The eyes, ears, and nose are impermanent and baseless; Likewise the tongue, body, and mind are also suffering, without self, and empty
They are lifeless matter, inert like hay or a wall; There is no self here, neither a person nor life force
Contact produces the three kinds of feelings
Even the smallest feeling is said to be accompanied by craving
Buddha can only mean someone who knows all causality; It does not refer to the aggregates, sense sources, and elements
The Three Jewels, which are so rare in this world, Have now appeared
The five monks— Kauṇḍinya and the rest— Along with sixty million gods Purified their eye of Dharma
At the same time hundreds of buddhas, residing in the ten directions, all became silent
This caused all their attendants to ask the victorious ones
This wheel is without mental elaboration because it is devoid of the sources of conceptual thinking
This wheel is undisturbed because of its infinite steadiness
a wheel free of any intent
It is a wheel of the unconditioned
a wheel of solitude, a wheel without desire
It is a wheel that is unconfused regarding the realm of phenomena, a wheel that is undisturbed concerning authentic limit
It is a wheel without attachment and obscuration

The gods, who had requested this Dharma teaching from the Thus-Gone One
were now gathered for the turning of the wheel of Dharma. In total there were more than , divine beings from the Pure Realms, led by such beings as Maheśvara, Nanda, Sunanda, Candana, Mahita, Śānta, Praśānta, and Vinīteśvara
It constitutes an introduction to the play that is the domain of the Buddha. The Thus-Gone One has taught it to introduce himself
So now you should absorb it, preserve it, and cause it to be retold

then rose up into the sky to the height of seven tāla trees

leaving nothing but a few relics on the ground

From this point on, the area came to be known as Ṛṣipatana, or the Hill of the Fallen Sages
The area also came to be known as Mṛgadāva, or the Deer Park, since deer frolicked there without fear
Monks, in this manner the Bodhisattva dwelt in the supreme realm of the Heaven of Joy, where he engaged in four great examinations
What were these four
He examined the time of his birth, the continent of his birth, the country of his birth, and the family of his birth
And why, monks, did the Bodhisattva examine the time of his birth
Because a bodhisattva does not enter his mother’s womb at the beginning of time when sentient beings are evolving
Rather it is when the world has forme
Analyze the four applications of mindfulness, The thorough relinquishments, the bases of miraculous power, The five faculties, the five powers, and the branches of awakening.” Such were the words that emerged from the instruments
there arrived a god from the Heaven of Joy by the name Hṛīdeva, on a visit concerning the Bodhisattva’s unexcelled and perfect awakening
You have manifested passing away, Famed One! Lion of Men, you have also manifested birth
“The appearance of these signs surely means that the Bodhisattva will now take food and obtain unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening.

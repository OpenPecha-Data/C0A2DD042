Visualization and Recitation of the Six-Syllable Mantra of Avalokiteśvara
Hrīḥ. In the centre of the pure realm of Potala,
Brilliant white, on a lotus and moon disc seat,
I appear in the form of Noble Avalokiteśvara,
White and radiant, with one face, four arms and two legs.
My first two hands are joined at my heart, and
The lower two hold a crystal rosary and a white lotus,
I wear silk and jewel ornaments and my seated legs are crossed.
And adorning my crown is Lama Amitābha, Buddha of Boundless Light.
All around are buddhas and bodhisattvas gathered like clouds.
From the oṃ āḥ hūṃ at my three centres stream out rays of light
Inviting the hosts of wisdom deities, who dissolve indivisibly.
In the centre of my heart on a lotus and moon disc seat is the syllable hrīḥ,
Surrounded by the mantra garland. From it
Light streams out, making offerings to the noble ones and purifying the obscurations of all beings.
The whole environment becomes the realm of Mount Potala.
All that appears is the form of the Great Compassionate One,
All sounds the speech of the six-syllable mantra,
And all thoughts the wisdom mind of emptiness and compassion.
Out of the genuine nature, beyond grasping and all-pervading, I recite the mantra:
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ
Hrīḥ. At my own mind, with mind, I look:
With nothing to identify, it's just like space,
With nothing whatsoever to see, vividly clear,
In that essence, which is emptiness, I remain.
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ
Out of that experience of unimpeded emptiness
Appearances arise, unobstructed and vividly clear,
Without bias, all-pervasive, uncompounded,
And with the nature of clear light – how wonderful!
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ
Clear yet empty, and empty yet clear,
Clarity and emptiness indivisible, beyond thought and expression—
This innate, genuine state of perfect bliss,
Is the ultimate Lord Avalokiteśvara.
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ

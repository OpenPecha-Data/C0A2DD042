By merely recalling this dhāraṇī all dangers will be eliminated
all accomplishments will be attained
and all sentient beings will be brought under control
On the eighth or fifteenth day of the moon, make vast offerings to Noble Tārā and then recite this dhāraṇī until you perceive Tārā directly
Whatever you desire will be given, and all boons will be granted
If this does not happen, it means that you had committed the five acts with immediate retribution
Indeed, immeasurable benefits will come
This was extracted from The Supreme Vajra Tantra
This concludes the noble dhāraṇī “Tārā’s Own Promise.

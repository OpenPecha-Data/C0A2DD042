Prayer to Kongtrul Yönten Gyatso
Emanation of Vairotsana, prophesied in kama and terma ,
Setting forth the way of the five great treasuries,
Holder of the Rimé teachings and treasury of qualities as vast as the ocean,
Lodrö Tayé, at your feet I pray!
Protector, your form-kāya has dissolved into absolute space,
And all at once, the triple world’s guide has gone.
So, out of compassion for those like me who are bereft,
I pray that you show us your smiling face once more!
Through the blessings and truth of the three jewels and three roots,
May your unmistaken, moon-like manifestation swiftly appear,
Bright with myriad cooling rays of learning’s triple ways, 1
And bathing all beings in the light of virtue and excellence!

Guru Yoga of the Great Omniscient One, Longchenpa
Āḥ. Within a spherical expanse of spontaneously present and naturally luminous rainbow light
Appears the primordially pure protector, Longchenpa;
Handsome with a radiant white complexion, he smiles.
The very essence of all refuges is seated before me in the posture of mind at ease—merely to recall him bestows the most excellent accomplishment.
Primordial protector with your body of pure wisdom,
With the greatest of respect I prostrate myself before you and present you with offerings.
I pray that throughout the garland of my lives to come we shall never be apart,
And that I may always follow you until I’m blessed—our minds merged as one.
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra mahā guru vimala rasmi sarva siddhi hūṃ 1
The guru appears delighted; dissolving into light he merges with me,
And the empowerment of the expression of enlightened wisdom is perfected within my mind—
The wisdom of awareness and emptiness conjoined, the exhaustion of all phenomena, which is the actual face of the guru,
The even expanse of the fourth time, wonderful!

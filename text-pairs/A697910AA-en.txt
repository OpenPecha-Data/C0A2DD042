The Wish-Fulfilling Tree A Prayer to the All-Embodying Lama Tsokyé Dorje
Emaho! Perfect Buddha, teacher who brought the two aims to perfection;
Sublime Dharma of scripture and realization, which tames and protects the mind;
Noble Saṅgha in whom knowledge and liberation were brought to perfection;
Ngayab Lingpa, embodiment of the Three Jewels, care for me!
I pray to you! Dispel all outer obstacles!
Grant your blessing so that all my aspirations may be spontaneously fulfilled!
Precious root and lineage masters, bestowers of blessings supreme;
Peaceful and wrathful iṣṭadevatās, bringing down a rain of siddhis;
Mātṛkās and ḍākinīs, ladies of enlightened activity:
Ngayab Lingpa, embodiment of the three roots, care for me!
I pray to you! Dispel all inner obstacles!
Grant your blessing so that all my aspirations may be spontaneously fulfilled!
Dharmakāya, unborn, primordially pure essence,
Saṃbhogakāya, naturally unceasing great bliss,
Nirmāṇakāya, all-pervasive compassion, tamer of beings,
Ngayab Lingpa, embodiment of the three kāyas, care for me!
I pray to you! Dispel all secret obstacles!
Grant your blessing so that all my aspirations may be spontaneously fulfilled!
Magical display of all the buddhas of the past,
Source of all the buddhas of the future,
Regent of all the buddhas of the present,
Ngayab Lingpa, embodiment of the buddhas of the three times, care for me!
I pray to you! Dispel all obstacles without exception!
Grant your blessing so that all my aspirations may be spontaneously fulfilled!

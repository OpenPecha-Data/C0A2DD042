Brief Sang Offering
Ho! With this smoke offering, in great clouds like those of Samantabhadra,
We sanctify the guru, yidam deity, buddhas and bodhisattvas,
We sanctify the vīras, ḍākinīs, dharma protectors and wealth deities,
We sanctify the warrior spirits, wermas , regional deities and treasure-keepers,
We sanctify all the personal gods and powerful guardians, 1
We sanctify the outer environment and its inhabitants into vast purity.
And we offer a sky-treasury of inexhaustible sensory delights.
Let everything be auspicious so that hindrances are pacified and all our wishes spontaneously fulfilled!
Recite Oṃ āḥ hūṃ.

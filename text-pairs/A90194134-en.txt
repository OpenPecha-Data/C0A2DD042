Victory Over All Adversity: A Prayer to Invoke Guru Rinpoche’s Wisdom for the Swift Fulfilment of Wishes
Emaho! In the supreme, invisible place, the glorious south-western buddhafield,
Padmākara of Uḍḍiyāna, three-kāya teacher,
Although essentially one and the same,
You manifest in inconceivable multiple ways To match the needs of each and every realm and class of beings.
Right now, we are in the age of the five degenerations.
Please do not abandon us, but look upon us with love and compassion.
Protect us against all outer obstacles — disease, harm, hindrances,
The eight fears, famine, war — whatever may occur.
Protect us, and bring forth fully the goodness in adversity.
Padmākara, please fulfil our wishes this very instant!
Expel all inner obstacles — the five poisons, laziness,
Desire, anger, busyness, the cognitive obscurations,
Harmful karma and all the afflictions – into the dharmadhātu!
Padmākara, please fulfil our wishes this very instant!
May all secret obstacles — the mental demons of fabrication and cherishing
Of view, meditation, conduct, and result —
Arise as the wisdom of settledness
Within the timeless original expanse of natural stability.
Padmākara, please accomplish our wishes this very instant!

Long-Life Prayer Presented to the Incarnation of Shukseb Jetsünma
Oṃ svasti!
Accomplished vidyādharā and foremost among the ḍākinīs,
Manifesting out of the space of Samantabhadrī
As the magical emanation of queen of yoginīs,
The display of Yeshe Tsogyal, deathless lady of great bliss,
Transformed into this goddess of wisdom—
May the life of this youthful Jetsünma long remain secure.
May she realize her great potential for study, contemplation and meditation,
And may her activity to benefit the teachings and beings spread far and wide!

Prayer to Longchenpa (Adapted from the Words of Mipham Rinpoche)
The primordial and spontaneous nature of luminous awareness
Is unchanging and of one-taste with all the victorious buddhas.
To you who have perceived this directly, Omniscient Lord of Dharma,
Drimé Özer, I pray!
With your brilliant, stainless insight you have clearly and unerringly understood
The meaning of the supreme vehicle in its entirety
And are possessed of the pith instructions of profound key points:
To the collection of your speech—fine explanations all—I pray!
The lion's roar that is the beautiful speech of buddhas and bodhisattvas
Has prophesied that you, protector, will awaken
And be renowned as the guide Rirab Marmé Gyaltsen.
At that time may I and all parent beings gather
At the place of your enlightenment as youthful bodhisattvas,
And, having enjoyed the nectar of your true words,
Receive a prophecy of our very own —
That we too will attain the ten powers!

The Spontaneous Fulfilment of All Wishes Invoking the Great Guru of Uḍḍiyāna
Kyema Kyehü! All-knowing Padmākara,
Look upon me with compassion, Ngayab Lingpa, care for me!
When Tibet’s borders are at war and hostility is near,
When the Victors’ teachings are disappearing like the sun passing over the mountains,
When Tibet’s king and ministers are in torment, worn down by suffering –
Then for these, your disciples of this Snowy Land,
Padmākara, my protector, in accordance with your promise,
Swiftly avert, without exception,
Invading armies, disease, war, famine, the eight fears,
All obstacles, hindrances and adverse circumstance —
Products of the law of cause and effect.
May the Victors’ teachings and those that hold, expand and share them be as widespread as the sky!
May sentient beings develop and mature, through the nectar of your teachings and practices!
Thus may we spontaneously accomplish the twofold benefit!

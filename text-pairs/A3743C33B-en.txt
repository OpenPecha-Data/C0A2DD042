Prayer for Ngawang Sherab 1
Oṃ svasti.
Embodiment of the wisdom of all the victors throughout the whole of space and time,
Omnipresent lord, sun-like Mañjuvajra,
Supreme sovereign of the oceanic teachings in their entirety,
Khyentse Wangpo, at your feet I pray.
The magical play of his primordial wisdom,
The protector who trains beings through ocean-like activity,
Mañjughoṣa guru, Chökyi Lodrö, to you
I pray from the depths of my heart: inspire me with your blessings!
May our faith and samaya commitment remain utterly pure,
May we complete the path of the two stages, 2
May the sun of co-emergent wisdom dawn within our hearts,
And may all be auspicious for the twofold aim to be perfectly fulfilled. 3

Prayer for the Long Life of Yangthang Rinpoche
Om svasti!
You uphold the tradition of the Ancient Translations, the heart-teachings of Samantabhadra,
Through the strength of your fearless mind of bodhicitta,
And were blessed by Padmasambhava, Guru of Great Bliss—
Ösal Dorjé , 'Indestructible Clear Light', we pray that you may live for a hundred aeons!

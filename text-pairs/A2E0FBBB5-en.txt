An actual manifestation of Mañjuśrīmitra and Vimalamitra,
And inseparable from them—
Jigdral Lingpa, to you I pay homage!
In this life and in all my future lives,
May I always accompany you, never parting even for a moment.
May my mind merge with your wisdom mind.
And may all be auspicious so that I gain awakening in the youthful vase body,
Wherein the luminous three kāyas are spontaneously present!

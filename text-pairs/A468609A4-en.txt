Supplication to Milarepa
Your pure channels and elements ripened as the mudrā of the deity;
Your speech, through prāṇāyāma , is the indestructible nāda ;
And your mind, through the experience of the four joys, is co-emergent bliss.
Lordly Shepa Dorje, I supplicate you.
Having given up addiction toward existence, let me be freed from the shackles of the eight worldly concerns.
With perfect respect, may I receive your blessings and see the guru as a buddha;
And, with single-pointed accomplishment of yoga in isolated places,
May I seize the throne of the four kāyas in but a single lifetime.
When my time comes, may I be born in your joyful buddha-field, my protector –
The natural manifestation of the pleasant realm, Manifest Joy.
Then, having awakened there, may I lead all the infinite beings
With whom I have a connection to the state of the mighty yogin.

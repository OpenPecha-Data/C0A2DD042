Sādhana of Bhaiṣajya Guru (Medicine Buddha)
I take refuge in the Guru and Three Jewels.
For all beings' sake, I shall accomplish the Buddha Bhaiṣajya Guru.
All phenomena are beyond reference, primordial emptiness.
Out of that experience, I appear, perfect upon recollection,
As Buddha Bhaiṣajya Guru—samaya- and jñānasattva inseparable.
His body is deep blue in colour and he has one face and two hands,
The right hand in the supreme generosity mudrā and holding Myrobalan,
And the left, in the gesture of equanimity, holding an alms-bowl of nectar.
He is fully adorned with the signs and marks and seated in vajra posture.
And he is dressed in the three dharma robes.
Seated upon lotus and moon-disc, he emanates countless rays of light.
At his heart, upon a moon, is Hūṃ surrounded clockwise by the mantra,
From which rays of light shoot out to invite countless Bhaiṣajya Gurus
Who arrive from the eastern direction and dissolve into me.
Further rays of light then emanate from his body once again,
To pacify sickness and the three poisons in beings who might be seen or heard,
So that they all attain unsurpassable awakening.
tadyathā | oṃ bhaiṣajye bhaiṣajye mahā-bhaiṣajye rāja-samudgate svāhā |
The one who visualizes all this is my own mind.
Mind itself is emptiness, beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence.
Whatever occurs, in simple non-distraction, I will sustain the essence.
Knowing how to meditate freely and naturally, without clinging or contrivance,
Pacifies the sickness of the five poisons and accomplishes Buddha Bhaiṣajya Guru.
Through the merit of visualizing and reciting mantra in this way,
May the sickness of all those I see, hear, think of and come into contact with be pacified,
And may we all become inseparable from Buddha Bhaiṣajya Guru himself.

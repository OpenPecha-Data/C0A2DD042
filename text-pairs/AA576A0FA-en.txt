Verses on the Buddha's Previous Lives
Namo!
You purify all the harmful destinies
Of all the beings of the three realms,
To you, the Lion of the Śākyas,
Who turns the Dharma Wheel, I offer praise!
To the heroic bodhisattvas
Who practised perfect generosity,
In the episodes of the tigress, the King of the Śibhis, the King of Kosalī,
The two merchants, the rabbit,
Agastya, Maitrībala who gave away his flesh,
Viśvaṃtara, and the sacrifice, I pay homage!
May I too accomplish the transcendent perfection
Of generosity, just like you!
To the heroic bodhisattvas
Who practised perfect ethical discipline,
In the episodes of Śakra, the brahmin,
Unmādayanīi, Supāraga,
The fish, the baby quail, the jar full of alcohol,
The rich man’s son, the ascetic and the treasurer, I pay homage!
May I too accomplish the transcendent perfection
Of ethical discipline, just like you!
To the heroic bodhisattvas
Who practised perfect patience,
In the ten episodes of Kuddhabodhi, the geese, Mahābodhi,
The monkey, Sharabha deer, Ruru deer, Monkey king,
Kṣāntivādin, Brahmā, and the elephant,
I pay homage!
May I too accomplish the transcendent perfection
Of patience, just like you!

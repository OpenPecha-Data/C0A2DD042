Sādhana of Mañjughoṣa
Oṃ arapacana dhīḥ
I myself appear as venerable Mañjughoṣa,
Orange and holding sword and volume,
Adorned with silks and jewel ornaments,
And seated in vajra posture on lotus and moon.
At his heart, upon a full moon disc
Is the syllable Dhīḥ, gold and blazing,
From which light radiates out, gathering intelligence,
Wisdom and dhāraṇī doors from all the buddhas and their bodhisattva heirs,
In the form of light rays, which gather back
And dissolve again and again into the vital syllables in my heart.

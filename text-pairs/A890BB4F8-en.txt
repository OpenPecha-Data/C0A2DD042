The Hook of Compassion A Prayer to the Garland of Successive Rebirths
Emaho!
Radiating from the sugata-essence, like the illusory reflection of the moon in water,
You arose through various means as a splendour for the teachings and beings.
In Śākyamuni's presence, you were the nun Utpali,
At Bodhgayā, the Vajra Seat, you were Rolang Derolma,
Cared for by Padma, you were Shelkar Shiwatso,
Vairotsana granted you blessings, ripening empowerments and liberating instructions.
You saw Tārā face to face and received the supreme attainment.
In Khotan, you were Changchub Chödrön Palmo,
In the Nelmo valley, you were Kunga Buma,
In Tsang valley, most recently, you were renowned as Tamdrin Wangmo, 1
In Central Tibet you are Sukhavajra Tsal,
And in future, in Dongchu, you will be Dewé Jungné—
To you in these, your successive lives, I pray!
Inspire me with your blessings, so that from this moment on, until I attain awakening,
I may never part from you, O noble yoginī,
And I may enjoy the splendid nectar of your profound teachings,
Without gradually progressing through the stages and paths,
I may realize the intent of the clear light Great Perfection,
Perfect the practice of Tögal's four visions,
And accomplish the rainbow body dharmakāya!
May I and those who are connected to me—all sentient beings—
Seize the stronghold of the non-abiding dharmakāya!

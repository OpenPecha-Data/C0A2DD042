Victorious in the Battle with the Four Demons A Prayer to the Lineage of the Wrathful Guru, Hayagrīva and Garuḍa
Samantabhadra, the dharmakāya endowed with the supreme of all qualities,
Saṃbhogakāya of the five families, complete with the five certainties,
And the supreme nirmāṇakāya, Pema Tötrengtsal—
To you I pray: grant me the attainments, ordinary and supreme!
Sovereign of profound treasures, vidyādhara Jigme Lingpa,
Mighty lord of siddhas, Trinle Özer,
And the lord of compassion, Gyalwé Nyugu—
To you I pray: grant me the attainments, ordinary and supreme!
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, blessed with the seven types of authoritative transmission,
Drime Longyang Tsal, 1 in whom the three lineages converged,
And Dorje Rabngak, whom that protector of beings 2 held in his care—
To you I pray: grant me the attainments, ordinary and supreme!
Merely hearing your names brings victory in the battle over obstacles;
Allies in subduing the graha , 3 nāgas and evil spirits of these degenerate times;
'Wrathful Lotus’ King of the Wrathful Ones, Hayagrīva and Garuḍa—
To you I pray: grant me the attainments, ordinary and supreme!
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May the habitual obscurations of the three appearances of transference 4 be eliminated,
And, with my three doors inseparable from the three vajras,
May I actualize the glorious, ultimate Heruka!

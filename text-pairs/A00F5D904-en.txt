The Sound of the Auspicious Conch 1 A Prayer for the Long Life of the All-Knowing Paṇchen Rinpoche of Tsang
Oṃ svasti!
Lord Amitābha, 'Boundless Light', of the blissful realm of Sukhāvatī
Manifest here and now in an emanated form garbed in saffron robes,
A protector for the beings of this five-hundred-year dark age—
All-knowing Paṇchen Lama, may your life may remain secure.
Sovereign of Dharma, sole friend of the blossoming water lily
Of intelligence in those fortunate beings who seek liberation,
Supreme guide, rich with the splendour of the ten powers— 2
May your lotus feet remain forever secure upon the vajra throne.
In exposition, you captivate the minds of many million scholars,
In debate, you reduce to dust the mountains of erroneous views,
In composition, you embellish the shrine of the Sage’s teachings—
Second all-knowing Victorious One, may your life remain secure.
All-seeing one, great treasury of knowledge, love and spiritual capacity,
Mighty king, sole refuge of the teachings and beings in this Land of Snows,
Wish-granting jewel to fulfil our hopes and furnish our needs and desires—
I pray that you may remain securely without obstacle upon the vajra throne.
With your supreme form, a maṇḍala of signs and marks, as radiant as the sun,
With the sound of your speech as sweetly harmonious as the voice of Brahma,
And with the secret of your mind profound and difficult to fathom—
Essential embodiment of all the victorious ones, may your life remain secure.
May the excellent goal of this prayer be fulfilled without obstacle
Through the truth and blessings of the victorious ones and their heirs,
And may the teachings of the gentle lord Tsongkhapa
Never decline but flourish and endure long into the future!

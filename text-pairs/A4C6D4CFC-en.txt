Concise Averting Ritual for the Practice of Hayagrīva and Garuḍa 1
Hūṃ. From the palace of the three doors of liberation within the spacious expanse
Of the Great Mother, the primordially pure dharmakāya,
Out of the vast wisdom expanse that is the unceasing radiance of awareness,
Arise the saṃbhogakāya deities of the Blazing Hayagrīva and Garuḍa.
These hosts of deities, outer, inner and secret,
Arise in order to avert the enemies and demons of saṃsāra and dualistic perception.
With manifold expressions of the nine demeanours, they appear like rainbows in the sky.
Now, on this day, to assist us, adepts of mantra, rise up!
Enjoy this torma of enemies and obstructing forces, flesh and blood,
And for all of us practitioners, our patrons and retinue,
Avert everything brought about when the causality of mind and mental states goes awry:
Disease, demonic influences, tragedies, disasters,
Hostility based on turmoil in the outer and inner elements,
The eight great and sixteen lesser dangers,
Dagger sorcery, evil curses and bad omens—
Please carry out your activity of averting them all!

A Prayer to Yumka Tsogyal
Emaho!
In the dharmadhātu palace of natural simplicity
Is the dharmakāya, Great Mother of the buddhas—to you I pray:
Bless me, so that all habitual patterns of the impure ālaya
May be realized as the dharmakāya of twofold purity!
In the spontaneously present land of unimpeded wisdom
Is the sambhogakāya Vajravārāhī—to you I pray:
Bless me, so that karmic winds, ālaya, defiled mental consciousness and so forth
May be purified as the five poisons are realized as the five wisdoms!
In the palace of taming sentient beings with compassion
Is the nirmāṇakāya, Yeshe Tsogyal—to you I pray:
Bless me, so that momentary concepts and confusion may naturally vanish,
And I may realize the enlightened mind of the Three Kāyas!
From now on, throughout all my lives to come,
May the Gurus and Ḍākinīs care for me with compassion!
May I fully engage with the sublime path of the Vajrayāna,
And awaken into the primordial ground of Samantabhadra!

Dharmakāya Transference
Āḥ!  In an instant, out of the state of the inseparable unity of clarity and emptiness,
Rays of wisdom light shine out, travelling to all six realms,
So that the consciousnesses of all beings transform into a single white syllable Āḥ, which
Through the blessings of the truth of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and the Lama, Yidam and Khandro,
Is gathered with the four mudrās, dissolving into me.
The original nature, in which clarity, awareness and emptiness are indivisible.
Is the essence, in which there is nothing to be transferred and no transferrer.
I utter the syllable Hik, which is inexpressible sound and emptiness, beyond the ordinary mind,
And everything is united and perfected within the great display that is beyond any limitation.
My own awareness is transferred into the expanse of the unborn dharmakāya.

Brief Red Sur
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Arisen from the habit of clinging to an 'I' throughout beginningless time,
Which stirs up the five poisons, so that they take on various forms—
The gyalgong spirits, damsi demons, female ghosts and the rest;
Those with broken vows and commitments and those with malice,
Who are forever doing harm to others,
Disrupting the accomplishment of wholesome acts,
Causing caprice, quarrelling and bringing ruin;
Stealing food, wealth, possessions and glory,
Together with the concealed spirits who stalk and pursue—
To all you guests to whom I owe karmic debts,
I present these substances that you crave, such as flesh and blood,
And clouds of fragrant burnt offering which arise as all that is desirable,
Increasing and expanding to become a treasury of space,
And dedicated to you all beyond dispute as to loss or gain.
As you are enlivened and satisfied with every possible delight,
May all my dues, karmic debts and bonds of vengeance be purified.
May the spirit of awakening arise within your minds,
And may you discover the bliss of liberation.
Through the force of the unfailing two truths,
May these prayers of aspiration be perfectly fulfilled!

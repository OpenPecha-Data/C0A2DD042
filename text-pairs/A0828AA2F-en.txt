A Sādhana of Kurukullā
Out of the state of emptiness, upon lotus, sun and corpse,
A syllable Hrīḥ transforms into Kurukullā, red in colour,
With one face, four arms, enchanting youthfulness and wrathful smile,
Her first two hands draw a bow and arrow of utpala flowers,
And the final two hold a hook and lasso.
She has three round red eyes and streaming orange hair adorned with five dry skulls,
And she wears a garland of freshly severed heads,
Bone ornaments, silk scarf and a skirt of tiger skin.
With one leg stretched and the other bent, she is in dancing pose with a sun behind
And in an expanse of red light, summoning the vital essence of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
The wisdom deity is invited through the syllables at her three centres, then dissolves.
The five families confer empowerment, with Amitābha as the crown ornament.
In the centre of her heart, upon a sun disc is a syllable Hrīḥ surrounded by the mantra,
From which light radiates out, magnetizing all that is excellent in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
oṃ kurukulle hrīḥ svāhā

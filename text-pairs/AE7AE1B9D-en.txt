The Spontaneous Fulfilment of All Wishes Confession and Fulfilment for the Great Compassionate One, Natural Liberation of Suffering
Hrīḥ. In the great pure realm of Sukhāvatī in the West
Resides our guide Amitābha, the Buddha of Boundless Light,
From whose compassion manifest the supremely noble deities of the Natural Liberation of Suffering—
I invite you to this place of fulfilment, please come!
Remain here on this seat of a multi-coloured lotus, a sun and moon.
With ardent devotion I pay homage with my body, speech and mind.
I present outer, inner and secret offerings beyond measure.
I openly acknowledge and confess impairments, breakages, errors, downfalls, negative actions and obscurations.
I rejoice in all the virtue accumulated in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
I urge you to turn the wheel of Dharma of the Natural Liberation of Suffering.
I beseech you to always act for the benefit of beings.
I dedicate all the virtue of the four immeasurables to sentient beings.
Hrīḥ. I present offerings of all the bodies of purifying water in this universe, large or small,
A multitude of flowers that grow on water and in meadows,
Incense, both naturally fragrant and produced through special combinations,
Dispellers of darkness such as the sun, the moon, and lamps,
Pure and perfectly fragranced water,
Various foods for gods and humans to consume in diverse ways,
Beautiful music, harmonious and sweet-sounding:
All this I offer—deities of the Natural Liberation of Suffering, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Lord of the Family and immortal protector, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four goddesses of the retinue, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four Hayagrīva gatekeepers, may your wishes be fulfilled.
With all your wishes fulfilled, may outer, inner and secret
Impairments, breakages, errors and downfalls be entirely purified,
Grant us the supreme and ordinary attainments,
And enable us to carry out all the enlightened activity of the Great Compassionate One!
Hrīḥ. All forms, the objects of engagement of visual consciousness,
Sounds that reverberate through the avenue of the auditory,
Various scents that manifest to the olfactory consciousness,
And a multitude of tastes, sensations and mental objects:
All this I offer—deities of the Natural Liberation of Suffering, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Lord of the Family and immortal protector, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four goddesses of the retinue, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four Hayagrīva gatekeepers, may your wishes be fulfilled.
With all your wishes fulfilled, may outer, inner and secret
Impairments, breakages, errors and downfalls be entirely purified,
Grant us the supreme and ordinary attainments,
And enable us to carry out all the enlightened activity of the Great Compassionate One!
Hrīḥ. The supreme medicine with the eight major and thousand minor ingredients,
The great rakta of the six causes 1 liberated into space,
The bali containing a hundred excellent tastes,
The union of bliss and emptiness and all liberated concepts:
All this I offer—deities of the Natural Liberation of Suffering, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Lord of the Family and immortal protector, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four goddesses of the retinue, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four Hayagrīva gatekeepers, may your wishes be fulfilled.
With all your wishes fulfilled, may outer, inner and secret
Impairments, breakages, errors and downfalls be entirely purified,
Grant us the supreme and ordinary attainments,
And enable us to carry out all the enlightened activity of the Great Compassionate One!
Hrīḥ. I present many other offering, fulfilment and accomplishment substances,
Both actually present and emanated by the mind,
To gather the accumulations and purify the obscurations of limitless beings.
Having purified all clinging to reality of the offered and the offerer,
Deities of the Natural Liberation of Suffering, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Lord of the Family and immortal protector, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four goddesses of the retinue, may your wishes be fulfilled.
Four Hayagrīva gatekeepers, may your wishes be fulfilled.
With all your wishes fulfilled, may outer, inner and secret
Impairments, breakages, errors and downfalls be entirely purified,
Grant us the supreme and ordinary attainments,
And enable us to carry out all the enlightened activity of the Great Compassionate One!
Hrīḥ. Through the power of this fulfilment and confession
May I and all other migrating sentient beings
Perfect the two accumulations and purify the two obscurations,
And avert all outer, inner and secret obstacles and unfavourable circumstances.
Through the power of the Three Roots and the ocean of oath-bound protectors,
May all who misguidedly scorn the teachings of the Early Translation School
Be annihilated, reduced to mere particles of dust,
And may the tradition of the Vajra Vehicle flourish and spread!

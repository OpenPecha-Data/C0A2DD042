Prayer to Gyarong Khandro Dechen Wangmo
Namo guru!
Great ḍākinī, you are the embodiment of the compassion and blessings
Of the wisdom ḍākinī Mandāravā,
The space-consort of great bliss, Yeshe Tsogyal, and the rest—
Dharmacandra, 1 'Moon of Dharma', at your feet I pray!
Grant your blessings so that I may purify all my negative karma, harmful actions and obscurations,
And cleanse all impairments and breakages of samaya, violations, faults and downfalls!
Wisdom ḍākinī, may your blessings fill my very being,
So that experience, realization and the power of rigpa develop boundlessly,
And all sickness, evil influences, sorcery and witchcraft are dispelled!
Dechen Wangmo, always hold me in your care,
Until ultimately, in the city of Lotus Light,
We become inseparable in the enlightened mind of secret wisdom!

Removing Obstacles in the Life of the Ḍākinī Prayer for the Long Life of Khandro Tsering Chödrön
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Embodiment of all gurus, Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal,
Assembly of all yidams, the eight Kagyé deities,
Embodiment of all the ḍākinīs, Vajravārāhī—
We invoke the power of truth of the all-pervading Three Roots!
Through your blessing, may all obstacles for the life of the supreme secret consort of long life, the Vajra Ocean, 1
Tsering Chödrön, Āyu Dharma Dīpaṃ (Long Life, Lamp of the Dharma),
Be liberated into the dharmadhātu ,
And all danger, harm and the summons of the ḍākinīs be averted!
May the immutable vajra pillar of her life-force remain firm!
For her, may youthfulness, the four joys, and all positive splendour grow ever more, and
Sealed by Evaṃ, the indivisible union of Mahāmudrā,
May all be auspicious, to attain the everlasting non-transference!

Prayer to Rigdzin Jatsön Nyingpo
Hrīḥ! From self-arising primordial purity and unaltered spontaneous presence
You arose as the magical expression of rigpa appearing in any form—
Bangriwa, 1 upholder of the Nyingma teachings of secret mantra —
Orgyen Letro Lingpa, to you I pray!
Initially, you trained thoroughly in sūtras, tantras and pith instructions;
Then, you accomplished the inseparability of development and completion;
Bangriwa, master of the absolute meaning of reality —
Rigdzin Jatsön Nyingpo, to you I pray!
Emanation of Padmākara, king of victorious ones, in the form of a monk,
You appeared as beings’ splendour in this time of degeneration,
Bangriwa, destroyer of the rudra of ego-clinging —
Ngakchang Hungnak Mebar, to you I pray!
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May the rain of temporary and ultimate accomplishments shower down,
And may we attain the rainbow body, radiant and endowed with wisdom, compassion and capacity—
I and others all together in a single maṇḍala.

The Falling Rain of Blessings A Brief Daily Practice of the Wealth Deity White Jambhala
Homage to Padmākara, embodiment of all sources of refuge!
Namo!
In the guru Padmākara, Avalokiteśvara,
And the Three Jewels, I take refuge.
I generate the wish that all sentient beings,
My past mothers as infinite as space, may attain Buddhahood.
With my mind unaltered, in a state of emptiness,
As the unceasing expression of clear empty awareness,
I appear as Ārya Jambhala,
Brilliant white, holding a staff in the right hand
And a jewel-spouting mongoose in the left,
While cradling a three-pronged khaṭvāṅga.
He is adorned with jewel ornaments
And sits on lotus and moon-disc seat,
Powerfully atop a turquoise dragon.
He is surrounded by a retinue of four classes of ḍākinī,
Each with their own implements and adornments.
At his crown are Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara,
And the five classes of victorious ones and long-life deities.
They all appear while lacking true reality,
Amidst an expanse of clear, empty rainbow light.
At Jambhala’s heart upon a lunar disc
Is the vital syllable and mantra garland,
From which light radiates, offering to the victorious ones and collecting their blessings.
Beings’ obscurations are purified, their longevity and merit increased.
As the gathering of all siddhis dissolves into me,
A rain of blessings and accomplishment descends.

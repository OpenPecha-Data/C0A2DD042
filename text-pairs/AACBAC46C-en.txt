Maṇḍala Offering
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ.
The maṇḍala of absolute space, ornamented by rigpa,
I offer to the guru, the dharmakāya buddha!
The maṇḍala of my own body, ornamented by the faculties,
I offer to the saṃbhogakāya guru of perfect enjoyment!
The precious maṇḍala, ornamented with gold and turquoise,
I offer to the compassionate nirmāṇakāya guru!
Guru ratna maṇḍalakaṃ niryātayāmi

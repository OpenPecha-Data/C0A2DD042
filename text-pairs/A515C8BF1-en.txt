Blazing Splendour of Good Fortune A Prayer for the Spread of the Teachings of the Katok Tradition
Oṃ svasti.
Through the power and truth of the Three Roots, victorious buddhas and their heirs throughout the whole of space and time,
And the dharma protectors and guardians of the Ancient Translations,
May this vital axis of Śākyamuni's teachings in general and the teachings of the Lord of Oḍḍiyāna in particular,
The sublime tradition of Deshek Pobpa Tayé, 1
Magnificent source of both kama and terma ,
Remain without ever declining until the end of existence and spread far and wide.
May the ocean-like community of ethical vow-holders increase,
Their minds replete with the three immaculate trainings.
May they devote their time to education and meditative accomplishment
And by means of the authentic view, meditation and conduct,
May they hold aloft their victory banner of Śākyamuni's teachings
And cause the definitive Secret Essence to flourish in every direction.

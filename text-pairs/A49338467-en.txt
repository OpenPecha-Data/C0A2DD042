The Unchanging Vajra Melody A Prayer for the Long Life of Ngawang Kunga Tekchen Palbar Trinlé Wangi Gyalpo, the Lord of Refuge and Precious Holder of the Throne of the Drolma Palace at Glorious Sakya
Oṃ svasti!
As the white lotus of excellent auspicious signs
Is cast from the hand of the youthful Mañjuśrī,
May the teachings of the glorious Sakyapa, possessors of the three supreme names, 1
Flourish and spread throughout the whole of Jambudvīpa.
Having merged inseparably with the three secrets 2
Of Mañjuśrī, Lion of Speech, who has the power of oratory,
Kunga Nyingpo has intentionally returned once more
As this sovereign of Mahāyāna Dharma—may your life remain secure.
Blazing with the glorious qualities of the nine ways of the noble, 3
You cause the three spheres of activity 4 to pervade the ten directions,
And dispel all the decadence of this degenerate age—
King of wish-fulfilling jewels, may your life remain secure.
Through the power of the true blessings of the guru,
Yidam deities, ḍākinīs, and guardians, may this prayer
Be fulfilled without obstacle, and may virtue, goodness
And auspiciousness reign victorious over all!

Serkyem Offering to Drikung Achi Chödrön 1
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ
The golden drink becomes immaculate nectar.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
To the Three Jewels, Three Roots, oceans of Dharma-guardians,
Wealth deities, treasure-keepers, gül deities, local chieftains,
And twelve tenma protectresses of Tibet, together with their retinues,
I present this offering of golden drink: carry out your activity.
To the great mother, in particular, foremost of all ḍākinīs,
Queen of space, Dechen Chödrön, together with her retinue,
I present this offering of the pure first portion.
Accept it and carry out the activity we request of you.
Out of the heart of the spiralling lotus of expansive space,
Through the fresh dew of the vajra sun of accomplishment,
May any deterioration of this yogin’s five elements be repaired,
And may you act to bring the blossoming lotus of twofold attainment.

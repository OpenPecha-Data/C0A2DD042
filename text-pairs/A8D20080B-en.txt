Brief Succession of Lives Prayer
Outwardly, you are the ācārya Mañjuśrīmitra,
Inwardly, the vidyādhara Hūṃkara,
Secretly, the noble mahāpaṇḍita Vimalamitra,
And most secretly, the Dharmarāja Longchenpa—
Dorje Zijitsal, to you I pray!
With great wisdom, you saw the nature of phenomena,
And with great compassion, you care for living beings,
Guided by your glorious guru, you are a treasure of wisdom and love—
Ngakgi Wangpo, at your feet I pray!
Throughout this life, in future lives, and in the bardo state,
Guide me affectionately without ever parting, and grant your blessings
So that I may receive the great secret nectar of ripening empowerments and liberating instructions,
And thereafter bring everlasting benefit and happiness to all beings!

Entrusting Activity
Kyé! In the past, the powerful, wrathful Padma Heruka
In the place known as Asura Cave,
Empowered you, pure embodiments of the twelve constellations,
As the twelve mātṛkā, oath-bound guardians of kīlaya,
And entrusted you with commitments and activity.
Now remember your solemn pledge!
Accept this samaya substance, the splendid torma,
And act to bring joy and happiness to all beings!
When the all-pervasive Lord Mañjuśrī, Loden Choksé,
Conferred the great empowerment into the power of awareness,
Upon the mantra-holder Dorje Dudjom,
The great lion of this world, Norbu Dradül Tsal,
Together with hosts of warriors, maidens and guardians,
Promised to carry out whatever activities were requested of you.
Now remember your solemn pledge!
Accept this samaya substance, the splendid torma,
And for the sole refuge of the Snowy Land, the lord of unblinking gaze, 1
Let his life be secure and long and his activity flourish in every direction!
For us yogis and those around us, the teacher and students,
Let all the activities of subjugation and acceptance
Be carried out about unimpededly here and now,
And let the goal of benefitting the teachings and beings be secured!
Samaya ho!

Brief Smoke Offering to the Great Lion of the World
Kye! Buddha appearing in human form, complete with miraculous powers
And wondrous force and strengthâ€”you who crushed the demons of Hor,
Bound demons and ogres under oath and brought happiness to Tibet.
Black-haired warrior god, Wish-Fulfilling Being, to you we offer purifying smoke:
Tutelary deity of ours, through this smoke offering, we exalt you!
At home, grant us long life, happiness and every excellence!
Abroad, grant us whatever we wish for and fulfil our desires!
And extend the dominion of the teachings throughout the ten directions!

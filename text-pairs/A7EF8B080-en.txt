Prayer to Amitāyus
Infinite Life, foremost guide for beings in this world,
You are the one who overcomes all untimely death,
A refuge for those who suffer without protection—
Buddha Amitāyus, homage and praise to you!
Everywhere ablaze with everlasting radiance,
You bestow boundless and boundless wisdom.
The thought of you dispels the fear of untimely death.
Bhagavān Amitāyus, homage and praise to you!
Your form is resplendent, like a mountain of ruby
Held in the light of a thousand suns,
And strewn with the vivid flowers of the signs and marks.
Amitāyus of Boundless Light, homage and praise to you!
Your speech resounds with sixty melodious tones,
A single voice extending through infinite realms.
Master of limitless and inexhaustible discourse,
Amitāyus of Vajra Speech, to you I offer praise.
You enter and arise from an ocean of samādhi,
Master of the ten powers freed from every veil,
Your oceanic wisdom spontaneously present,
Lord of Boundless Radiance, to you I offer praise.
In immense palaces within infinite realms you preside
Amidst the buddhas and their heirs from every direction,
As you savour together the Dharma of the Great Vehicle.
King of Jewel-like Brilliance, to you I offer praise.
Your activity is unending, equal to space itself,
You ripen and liberate oceans of disciples.
Your emanations are limitless, lord of the blissful realm,
Amitāyus of Infinite Deeds, to you I offer praise.
Through praising you in this way, may untimely death be pacified,
And, having fully actualized the three doors as the three vajras,
May I plant the iron tree of indestructible, vajra-like vitality
And attain the level of the protector Vajra Amitāyus.

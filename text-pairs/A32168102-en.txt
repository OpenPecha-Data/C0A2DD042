A Simple Method of Transference for Helpless Animals
Arisen from the sky-like equipoise of absolute space,
During the post-meditation,
From energy and mind, the essence of consciousness
Of all these helpless animals
Are fashioned illusory forms, bodies of light,
Each becoming the deity, Great Compassionate One.
With a murmur akin to the expression of lotus speech,
Like a hundred eagles scattered by a slingshot,
They all travel instantly, through the utterance of Phaṭ,
To the supreme western pureland of Sukhāvatī.
Phaṭ! Phaṭ! Phaṭ!

Prayer to Chökyi Wangpo, the Bodhisattva 1 and Tamer of Beings
In the land of the Āryas, you were the master Śāntideva;
In this land of snow-capped peaks, you were the nirmāṇakāya Aro Yeshe Jungne; 2
And now you are Chökyi Wangpo, the tamer of beings:
To this great source of benefit for all with a connection, I pray!
With great renunciation, you planted the victory banner of accomplishment;
With great bodhicitta, you look upon all beings as your very own children;
With great wisdom, you bring down an infinite shower of Dharma:
Remembering your qualities of liberation, I pray to you from the depth of my heart!
Through the inspiration and blessings of praying in this way,
May the life of the venerable guru remain secure for a hundred aeons,
May his activity of teaching and practice spread in all directions,
And may all be auspicious to accomplish the twofold benefit of self and others!

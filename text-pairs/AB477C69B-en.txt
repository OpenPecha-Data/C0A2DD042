A Supplication to Noble T훮r훮, The Wish-Fulfilling Cornucopia 1 Taken from the Magical Letters
Emaho.
Exalted T훮r훮, sole embodiment of the blessing and compassion
Of the three rare and sublime ones, the unfailing sources of refuge,
I humbly pay homage at your feet
And those of your twenty-one emanations.
From this very moment and in all lives to come
Pray hold us in your great love.
May all who see, hear, recall, or come into contact with me in any way, generate magnificent bodhicitta, most supreme,
And swiftly attain complete and perfect awakening.

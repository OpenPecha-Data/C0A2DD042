A Prayer
Emaho!
Pervasive lord and primordial protector, Samantabhadra,
Sambhogakāya of great bliss, Amitābha,
Compassionate tamer of beings, glorious Padmākara,
And the sky-like yogin, Dudjom Drakpa Tsal—
To all of you I pray: Inspire my mind-stream with your blessings,
So that I may conquer saṃsāra, benefit all with whom I am connected,
And gain the glorious power to stir saṃsāra from its very depths!

Wayfaring Offering 1
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
The Three Jewels, Three Roots, dharma protectors, wealth deities,
Custodians of place and treasure, local guardian spirits,
And especially Tārā, Padmasambhava, Mārīcī,
One Mother, Palden Lhamo, Shingkyongma, Durtrö Lhamo,
Yudrönma, Tseringma, Nyenchen Tanglha,
Gesar, Dorje Lekpa, and the rest—all you guardians of the way,
Accept this first portion of the drink of nectar that delights the senses,
Guard and protect us yogins and yoginīs,
And guide, assist and support us, we pray.
Ward off all harm from enemies, bandits, thieves and robbers,
And make everything auspicious wherever we go, wherever we stay.

A Record of the Successive Incarnations
Oṃ svasti!
Vairocana, source of all incarnations, pervading existence and peace,
Vajradharma, the śrāvaka Ānanda,
King Jaḥ, noble Āryadeva,
Kṛṣṇācārya, Tönmi Sambhoṭa,
Śāntigarbha, the great abbot Śāntarakṣita,
Vairotsana, the great Nyak lotsāwa Jñānakumāra,
Lhalung Palgyi Dorje, Zurchen Shakya Jungne,
Drapa Ngönshé, Rongzom, Pamting Jigme Drakpa,
Khyungpo Naljor, noble Dīpaṃkara,
Rechungpa, Chadul Tsöndrü Bar,
Sakya Paṇḍita, Melong Dorje, the omniscient Longchenpa,
Lhodrak Lekyi Dorje, Jamyang Tashi Palden,
Dharma Lord Shadeu Trulshik Kunga,
Kunga Nyingpo, noble Gyurme Dorje,
Guyang Lodé, Trulshik Dongak Lingpa,
And, in future Möpa Tayé and the rest—this garland of rebirths
Appears to those to be trained like the moon's reflection in water.
Now, according to the prophecies of several noble beings,
You appear as the one called Ngawang Dongak Tenzin Norbu,
Or Gyurme Chökyi Lodrö—
With unshakeable faith and inspiration, I pray to you!
To the source and all these dance-like emanations,
You from whom they radiate and in whom they are embodied,
I pray: swiftly inspire me with your blessings!

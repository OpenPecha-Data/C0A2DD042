Brief Gesar Windhorse Invocation
Hūṃ! The great flag of the windhorse, auspicious and sweet‑sounding far and wide
Sends out a vast cloud of exquisite offerings, like those of Samantabhadra.
Through this offering, may the Three Roots—guru, deva and ḍākinī—protectors, dralas, and gods in action,
And all you guests who care for and protect us—
Especially you, Gesar Norbu Dradul Tsal,
With your miraculous, wild and skilful vajra steed,
Your fearless warriors, ladies, attendants and envoys—
Cause all our aspirations to be spontaneously fulfilled!

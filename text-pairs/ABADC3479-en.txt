Expeditious Activity Torma Offering
Hūṃ. Out of the infinite realms of the three kāyas,
Appears Mahākāla, guardian of the teachings,
Glorious Vajra Pañjaranātha,
The Great Mother Ekajaṭī,
Īśvarī, Goddess of the Desire Realm,
Oath-bound Putra, brother and sister,
Great Four-faced Caturmukha, Protector of Nyen,
The Great Mother, Four Sisters and the rest—
Guardians of the teachings together with their retinues,
Through this vast offering torma and golden drink,
Support, fulfilment and accomplishment substances, and so on—
May these boundless offerings, actual and emanated by the mind,
Fulfil the wishes of Mahākāla,
Fulfil the wishes of Ekajaṭī,
Fulfil the wishes of the Desire Realm Goddess,
Delight and fulfil the exacting demands
Of Caturmukha, powerful lord and kṣetrapāla,
And of the Great Mother and four sisters,
Fulfil the wishes of all attendant deities and arrogant spirits
Of the three classes of tantra, together with their retinues.
I confess my offences, confusions, impairments and breakages.
Carry out your activity of causing the teachings
And the holders of the teachings to prosper and flourish,
For us practitioners, our patrons and those around us,
Avert all harm through sorcery and spell-casting,
Prevent the violence of malevolent spirits,
Pacify disease, enmity and conflict,
Improve vitality and health, increase affluence,
Fulfil our every wish, just as we desire,
Make everything perfectly auspicious, virtuous and well.
And without ever parting, guard and watch over us.

Kṣitigarbha Visualization and Mantra Recitation Mantra Recitation
The syllable kṣiṃ transforms into Kṣitigarbha, golden in colour,
Wearing a golden upper garment, peaceful, with bloodshot eyes,
And with a garland of blue flowers upon his head.
His right hand holds a fruit
And his left a precious stone upon a lotus.
He radiates rays of green light and is surrounded by a retinue including Vajrapātāla,
In a golden palace encircled by jewelled rock peaks and snow-capped mountains.
Adorned with silks and jewels, he sits in the posture of a bodhisattva on a lotus and moon-disc and has a crown of the five buddhas.
At his forehead is the syllable oṃ ,
At his throat is āḥ ,
And at his heart is hūṃ .
Lights radiate from these syllables, and with vajra samājaḥ invite the jñānasattva,
Who dissolves into the samayasattva with jaḥ hūṃ baṃ hoḥ .
To seal the union, chant oṃ kṣiharaja svāhā seven times.
oṃ sumbhani sumbha haracara mahāpāśa maruta amogha vajrasattva svāhā
oṃ kṣitasagarbha kṣim svāhā

Rays of Moonlight to Dispel the Darkness of Misdeeds
Respectfully, I take refuge
In all the buddhas and their heirs
Throughout the three times and ten directions,
Until I reach the essence of enlightenment!
With my palms together, I pray
To the supreme, unfailing source of refuge:
In this and all my other lives,
Overwhelmed by afflictions and the three poisons,
Physically, vocally and mentally,
I have committed the five boundless crimes, five deeds of approximate gravity,
And ten non-virtuous forms of action—
From the depths of my heart, I confess them all to you, my protectors.
Whatever I have done to harm or injure
The Three Jewels or the guru,
My own parents or anyone else besides,
I confess from the depths of my heart!
All the evil actions that lead to rebirth
In the dreaded hells or in the preta realms,
Among animals or barbarians of the borderlands,
Or as uncomprehending or wrong-viewed, I confess!
Whatever I have done to belittle or harm others
Out of my own arrogance and pride
Based on wealth, youth, strength and the like,
I now confess it all!
In short, whatever I have done unwittingly
To obstruct attainment of the higher realms,
Definitive goodness or genuine omniscience,
I now confess with intense feelings of remorse!
Whatever negative acts I have committed
Or rejoiced in when done by others—
Both natural and proscribed misdeeds,
I now thoroughly confess them all!
Victorious ones endowed with great compassion,
And the great beings who are your bodhisattva heirs,
Lovingly consider me—a wrongdoer—
And purify all my harmful actions, I pray!
Feeling regret for my past non-virtues
As I would for having imbibed poison,
I vow never to act that way again even for a moment
And even at the cost of my life!
Through whatever merit I have gained
By confessing and pledging in this way,
May I and all other living beings
Swiftly attain awakening!

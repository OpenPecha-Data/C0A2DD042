The Testament Prayer to Orgyen Rinpoche
Emaho! The dharmakāya Samantabhadra, and Vajradhara, the Sixth,
The teacher Vajrasattva, and the blessed king of the Śākyas,
Lord Amitāyus 'Boundless Life', and Avalokiteśvara too—
To you, Padma, who are inseparable from them all, we pray!
Your enlightened body is Mañjuśrī Yamāntaka, Slayer of Yama,
Your enlightened speech, the neigh of the mighty Hayagrīva,
And your enlightened mind, by nature, Yangdak Heruka—
To you—Guru, Wish-Granting Jewel—we pray!
Your brilliant qualities are, in essence, Chemchok Heruka,
Your enlightened activity is Vajrakumāra, the youthful,
And you are Ngöndzok Gyalpo, chief of the mamos and ḍākinīs—
Great and glorious Tötreng Tsal, to you we pray!
The space of your enlightened form contains the illusory net of peaceful and wrathful deities,
The melodious sound of your enlightened speech has the twelve special qualities,
And your enlightened mind is all-penetrating and all-pervasive in its realization—
To you, the lord over all the ḍākas and ḍākinīs, we pray!
You prophesied emissaries—physical representatives—and concealed tokens of your speech as terma,
You entrusted the realization of your enlightened mind to fortunate disciples,
And you left behind your loving testament for all your Tibetan subjects—
Kind and gracious nirmāṇakāya, to you we pray!
We remember your great kindness, O Guru Rinpoche,
And we beg you: recall your pledge to hold us always in your care!
For in these evil times we have no other hope but you—
Look upon us with compassion, O nirmāṇakāya guru of Orgyen!
With your power, strength and capacity, dispel the turmoil of this evil age,
Inspire us with your blessings, grant us the great wisdom empowerment,
Cause the strength of our experience and realisation to grow,
Give us the power and skill to benefit the teachings and beings,
And bring us, we pray, to enlightenment within this very life!

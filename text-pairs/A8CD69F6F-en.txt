Rituals for the Blue-Clad Vajrapāṇi
Homage to the Three Jewels!
Homage to the overlord of yakṣas, 1 Blue-Clad Vajrapāṇi,
Authorized by as many Buddhas as grains of sand in the river Ganges,
You who appear baring your fangs;
You whose eyes are like masses of flames;
You whose breath blazes with fiery tongues;
You whose roar terrifies;
You whose hands and legs are adorned with the nāga Vāsuki;
You who sport the nāga Kāla as a sash;
You who make the nāgas Nanda and Upananda your earrings;
You who don a jeweled crown of blazing snakes;
You who consume blazing poisonous serpents;
You whose visage is expansive;
You whose eyebrows and forehead are tensed;
You whose upper teeth bite your lower lip;
You whose accoutrements are those of Yāma;
You whose tongue moves as fast as lightning;
You whose large belly digests snakes;
You who terrify with the sound of clapping hands;
You, on whose belt, Garuḍa, the ruler of nāgas, is tied;
You who proclaim, “A la la!”
You whose shins reach 80,000 leagues down to the depths of the ocean;
You who bear Indra and Sūrya upon your shoulders;
You who annihilate all nāgas;
You whose bellowing laughter makes everything tremble;
You who have the appearance of Yāma;
You who frighten the three realms;
You, the slayer of nāgas!

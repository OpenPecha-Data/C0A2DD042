Short Prayer to the Three Great Stūpas of Nepal 1
The immaculate dharmakāya wisdom of the Victorious Ones
Manifesting in forms that tame beings according to their temperament—
To these three wondrous supports, which perform the marvellous activity
Of benefitting all who come into contact with them, I pray.
Through the merit of devotedly prostrating, making offerings, and circumambulating,
May I and all others who have made a connection
Completely purify our negative karma, harmful actions, obscurations and habitual tendencies,
And swiftly attain the level of perfect freedom and liberation.

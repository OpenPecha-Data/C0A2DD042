Longevity Practice for the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities of Droltik
From the life-force of the infinite peaceful and wrathful deities,
Light shoots out to gather the vitality of all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Which dissolves into me and the substances of accomplishment,
Establishing the vajra life-force of immortality.

A Concise Feast Prayer
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ! Oṃ āḥ hūṃ!
Deities of the infinite Three Roots and maṇḍalas, please come,
Accept and enjoy this feast offering of the sensory delights of fivefold wisdom!
May your hearts be fulfilled as I confess all transgressions, confusions, impairments and breakages!
Liberate dualistic fixation into space, and grant me supreme and ordinary siddhis, I pray!

The Rain of Enlightened Activity A Prayer to the Gurus of the Lineage of the Vital Essence of the Aural Transmission Kīla
Samantabhadra, primordially pure space of the ground,
Vajrasattva, manifest from the ground as its wisdom play,
And Vajrakumāra, the union of space and awareness—
To you I pray: let great rains of enlightened activity descend!
Noble Prabhāhasti, great siddha of Vajrakīla,
Śakya Sengge, who annihilated the forces of Māra,
And Lady Tsogyal, wisdom consort to whom this instruction passed—
To you I pray: let great rains of enlightened activity descend!
Pema Dongak Lingpa, who gained the blessings of aural transmission,
Gargyi Wangchuk, 1 charioteer who accomplished the Karma family,
And Dorje Wangchok Tsal, 2 who mastered every form of activity—
To you I pray: let great rains of enlightened activity descend!
One named Mati, 3 who kept the treasury of all the buddhas’ liberation,
Gurus who uphold the lineage containing the essence of instruction,
And all the yidam deities, ḍākinīs, and oath-bound guardians—
To you I pray: let great rains of enlightened activity descend!
May the material kīla annihilate enemies and obstructors;
May the kīla of existence purify attached perception as deity forms;
May the kīla of bodhicitta perfect the paths and stages within the central channel;
And may the kīla of pristine awareness ripen as the kāyas and wisdoms!

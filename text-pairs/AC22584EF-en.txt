Descent of the Compassionate Blessings of King Gesar, Great Lion of this World
Hrīḥ! Great lion of this world, emanated through the compassion
Of Pema Tötreng Tsal, embodiment of all the Three Roots,
Together with the dralas , wermas , brave warriors and maidens,
I invoke you all with intense and fervent devotion:
Consider us lovingly with compassion and come here now.
During this, the end of time, rife with fivefold degeneration,
We have no other hope, no other source of refuge but you.
To safeguard the fresh seedlings of the dharmic lineage,
Confer your compassionate blessings upon this fortunate one
And make plain the signs and symbols of great inspiration.
Forge from this body a fortress for the dralas and wermas,
Bless my body, speech and mind as the three vajras,
Increase my intelligence, confidence, power, strength and capacity,
And grant me the attainment of universal victory,
Bringing all three realms and planes of existence under my control.

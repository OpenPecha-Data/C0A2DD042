The Shower of Blessings: A Prayer
Ah! Guru, care for me!
Guru, care for me!
Guru, care for me!
Embodiment of all sources of refuge,
Guru of unrepayable kindness,
Gracious root guru, care for me!
O guru, care for me!
With the view of the Great Perfection beyond the mind,
Simultaneously merging with space and awareness,
You are beyond meditation and free from deliberate activity:
Gracious root guru,
Yogi of the sky-like Great Perfection,
Shakya Shri, care for me!
I pray to you from the depths of my heart!
Look on me with your eyes of wisdom!
For me, your subject and disciple,
Cause the wisdom of the Great Perfection
To arise effortlessly in my mind,
And so that I might be able to benefit all beings—
Who extend throughout the whole space—impartially,
Watch over me with your compassionate vision!

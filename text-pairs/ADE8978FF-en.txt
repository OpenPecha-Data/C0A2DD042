Ḍākinī’s Delight A Feast Song
Ahoye!
From Cāmara’s Glorious Mountain, the nirmāṇakāya realm of Lotus Light,
O Vajra Guru, Padmākara, care for me!
Only mother, ḍākinī Yeshe Tsogyal, care for me!
Lotus-Born guru and consort, watch over me, inseparable in your compassion!
When those with the karma and aspirations call out to you in prayer,
Lead us here and now to the realm of great bliss and liberation!
Become a steersman to guide all beings without exception!
As we call out to you day and night in sweet and ardent song,
Come, come directly, with the love of a mother for her child.
As we beg you to bestow here and now the great blessings
Of enlightened body, speech and mind and vajra wisdom,
Infuse this child with physical, vocal and mental inspiration!

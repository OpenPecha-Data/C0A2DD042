Aspiration for the Country’s Welfare
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Supreme protector of sentient beings, Orgyen Rinpoche,
Together with the assembly of vidyādharas and ḍākinīs—
To you we pray with one-pointed devotion!
As you promised, consider us lovingly from the absolute expanse!
Look upon us, exhausted beings, with compassion!
We pray to you, Orgyen Rinpoche:
Dispel adversity and pacify all discord
From mātṛkās and ḍākinīs and degenerations of the age;
Increase prosperity in the environment and among its inhabitants;
Conflict, epidemics, earthquakes, plagues of vermin and so forth,
Evil thoughts and actions among those with and without form—
Please pacify all such forms of adversity!
May the teachings spread and the holders have long lives,
And may the splendour of joy and happiness fill the world!

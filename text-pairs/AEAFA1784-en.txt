Prayer for the Long Life of Sogyal Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti! Through the power and blessings of Padmasambhava, who has attained the deathless wisdom body, and
The Glorious Tārā, swift to act,
May the incarnation of the 'King of Merit', the great Tertön Sogyal,
Enjoy a life that is secure and long: may all his enlightened activities be completely fulfilled!

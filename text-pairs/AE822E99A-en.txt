Harmonious Clouds of Sublime and Lasting Bliss A Vajra Song for the Tsok Feast Offering to Venerable and Exalted Vajrayoginī
As the play of clear light, primordial wisdom endowed with the supreme of all skilful means,
Their union appears before us in the subtle rūpakāya form,
Glorious guru, the very thought of whom dispels all anguish—
Grant your blessings so that the wisdom of bliss-emptiness dawns within my mind!
É is all-pervading space, the natural state, utterly pure, beyond elaboration,
And the syllable vaṃ manifests as the signs and marks of sixteenfold joy—
Spontaneously-born, 1 sky-faring Khecarī, Lady of Yoginīs,
Grant me the siddhi of subtle energy-mind dissolving within the central channel!
Naturally appearing in the twenty-four sacred places,
Taking the form of skilful means and wisdom mudrās, ḍākas and ḍākinīs,
Pureland-born messengers—through your gathering for the tsok feast,
May I enjoy the fortunate enrapture of a hundred sensations of great bliss.
The expressions of your samādhi adorn the sky of emptiness,
As amazing and as varied as a rainbow—the ‘bow of Indra’—
Mantra-born yoginī, Vajra Queen, lady of samādhi’s joy,
Come now, as a consoling friend and consort to transform appearances into ecstasy supreme!
Here, at the zenith of the wondrous vajra vehicle’s sublime path,
Through this practice of enjoying the feast of ultimate secret nectar,
May all ordinary appearances of the environment and beings
Be perfected as the glorious heruka—this aspiration, I offer!

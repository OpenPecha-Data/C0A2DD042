Prayer to the Gurus of the Dzogchen Lineage
Emaho!
My very own pure awareness, dharmakāya Samantabhadra,
Spontaneously perfect and unceasing, saṃbhogakāya Vajrasattva,
Manifest display of indivisible unity, Lord Garab Dorje—
To these gurus of the three kāyas, I pray!
Sovereign of the Dzogchen teachings, Mañjuśrīmitra,
Treasury of the two kinds of attainment, Śrī Siṃha,
Embodiment of infinite victorious buddhas, Padmākara—
To these incomparable gurus, I pray!
Sun of the Buddha’s teachings, omniscient Longchenpa,
Lord of all vidyādharas, Jigme Lingpa,
Unwaning victory banner of the sacred Dharma, with the name of Bodhi— 1
To these vidyādhara gurus, I pray!
Matchless Jñāna, who was like a second victorious buddha, 2
Holder of the treasury of the Dharma of kama and terma , Phuntsok Jungné, 3
One who is devoted to this path and holds the name of Ratna— 4
To these most gracious gurus, I pray!
Through the power and strength of praying in this way,
May we who gather as a group of vajra awareness-holders,
Mature our minds through the four empowerments and thoroughly purify the four obscurations,
So that we gain the four levels of a vidyādhara and the fruition of the four kāyas,
And reach the supreme stage of the unsurpassed Wisdom Guru!

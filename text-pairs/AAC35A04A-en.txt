Prayer to the Lineage of Vajra Akṣobhya
Amitābha, Boundless Light, Immortal Padmākara,
Tsogyal of great bliss, lord and subjects, lotsāwas,
Gyutrul Dorje, 2 Sonam Deutsen, 3
Tashi Özer, master Könchok Gön,
Namkha Gyatso, Drimé Zhingkyong Gönpo, 4
Master of maturing and liberating, embodiment of the whole lineage tradition,
To you I pray: grant me the supreme attainment.
Make manifest the blissful pureland of Abhirati!
To the bliss-gone conqueror, lord Akṣobhya,
Together with all the display-like emanations
Of the spontaneously perfect maṇḍala, support and supported, I pray:
Make manifest the blissful pureland of Abhirati!
Through the samādhi in which my three doors are unmoving,
May sounds and concepts be purified as the faces and three vajras.
May we realize the eight types of siddhi and four levels of a vidyādhara,
And ripen as the kāya of Vajra Akṣobhya!

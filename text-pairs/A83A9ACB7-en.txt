Guru Padma Yoga Prayer
Emaho!
Before me, in the space of my own pure perception,
My root guru appears as Guru Padma,
Embodiment of all sources of refuge,
And I offer heartfelt prayer: inspire me with blessings!
Pacify obstacles and adversity.
Cause all my wishes and aspirations to be fulfilled.
Preserve me from untimely death.
Let me be guided and cared for by the Guru
In this and all my lives to come.
Outwardly, you are the bodhisattva lord Chökyi Lodrö,
Inwardly, you are Mañjuśrī and Vimalamitra,
Secretly, you are the Glorious Heruka with perfect attributes,
I pray to you: bless my mind, inspire my understanding!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
The guru melts into light and dissolves into me.
And, inseparable, I receive the blessings.

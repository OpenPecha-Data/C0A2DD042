Prayer to the Successive Lives of the Great Trulshik 'Destroyer of Delusion'
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
In Aṭakāvatī, you were the mighty Lord of Secrets,
During the Buddha's time, you were his attendant Ānanda;
In Songtsen Gampo's day, you were the Dharma minister Gar Tongtsen;
In Padmasambhava's time, you were Vairotsana;
And, to tame the wicked king, Lhalung Palgyi Dorje;
During Milarepa's time, you were Rechung Dorje Drak;
And you were Lekyi Dorje, who held Vajrapāṇi's transmission;
You were Melong Dorje of Lhodrak Kharchu,
And in the hermitage of Shade'u, Trulshik Kunsö—
Embodiment of them all, lord of the maṇḍala, who renounced ordinary activity,
Kunzang Tongdrol Dorje, to you I pray!

Song of the Feast (Tsok Lu)
On top of a wish-fulfilling tree, the auspicious coincidence of karma and aspiration,
The youthful peacock of eastern India has arrived.
When the display of the peacock becomes holy Dharma,
We youthful ones are set onto the path of liberation.
On the chariot of the meritorious queen of spring,
From the tree-groves of Mon in the south has come the cuckoo-bird with its sweet song,
Sweeter than the music of the flutes of the daughters of the gandharva above.
How good the excellent coincidence of the flourishing three months of summer!
Gathered here are the vajra brothers and sisters whose karma and aspirations are in accord.
Please come to this Dharma assembly where our guru dwells.
At this festival we drink the amṛta that ripens and frees,
And from that comes the special Dharma of singing the songs of joyful experience.
Among these rows of unchanging great bliss,
Even when not meditating, we witness the faces of the deity and the guru.
By means of the yāna of luminosity, the heart-essence of the mother and ḍākinīs,
Please grant attainment—the rainbow body, the dharmakāya!

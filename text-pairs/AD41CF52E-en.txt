Prayer to Ārya Tārā
Oṃ! Homage to you, lady who protects us from the eight fears!
Homage to you, lady who blazes with the splendour of auspiciousness!
Homage to you, lady who closes the door to lower rebirth!
Homage to you, lady who leads us on the path to higher realms!
You are the one who holds us always in your care—our guide, support and friend;
So protect us still, we pray, with all of your vast compassion!

Long Life Prayer for Kyabje Dzarong Trulshik Shadeu Tulku Rinpoche
Oṃ Svasti!
Lord who possesses the treasure of the essential realization of the vast expanse—
The traditions of the Buddhadharma in general, and especially the profound secret mantra of the Ancient Translation School,
Holder of the Vinaya discipline, Gyurme Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö,
May your life be forever firm, and may your enlightened activity be spontaneously accomplished!

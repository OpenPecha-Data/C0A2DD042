Supplement to the Lineage Prayer for the Lamdré Instructions Composed by Tsarchen
In the hermitage of Great Liberation and Awakening,
You hold the treasury of the great secret Private Instructions,
Learned and accomplished Vajradhara of Thartse,
Tenpai Gyaltsen, 1 at your feet I pray.
In the uppermost residence of Ewaṃ Chökhor,
You are the supreme heart-son of the Mañjughoṣa guru,
With mastery of the splendours of teaching and practice,
Richen Dorje, 2 at your feet I pray.
In the dharma palace of Ganden Sabzang, 3
You are the embodiment of all the victorious ones of the three times,
Mañjughoṣa guru, Gatön Dorje Chang,
Ngawang Lekpa, 4 at your feet I pray.
In the medicinal valley where non-sectarian scholars and adepts gather,
You the holder of the profound and vast Dharma-treasury of sūtra and mantra,
With incomparable intellect and attending to limitless disciples,
Glorious guru, 5 at your feet I pray.

Brief Tsok Prayer
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ oṃ āḥ hūṃ
These sensory delights, substances of the feast, are the adornment of wisdom's display.
Chief of the assembly, lord of the feast-gathering, vidyādhara-guru,
Maṇḍalas of the three seats and lords of the twenty-four sacred places,
Ḍākas, ḍākinīs, and oath-bound guardians of the Dharma:
Come now, accept these enjoyments of the feast-gathering.
We confess our transgressions, confusions and faults, and impairments and breakages of samaya,
Liberate outer and inner obstacles into the dharmadhātu expanse of reality
Accept the remainder torma and carry out your activities!

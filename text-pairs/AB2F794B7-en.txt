Pearl Droplets of Blessings: A Prayer to the Guru Who Embodies All Extracted from A Shower of Precious Blessings: A Garland of Prayers to Guru Rinpoche, Embodiment of All Refuge Objects, and to the Three Roots and Lineage Masters
You infuse all the dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya vidyādharas of
The wisdom, sign, scriptural, treasure, and aspiration lineages in all three times.
To you, Guru embodying all guru-buddhas,
I pray: please bless my mindstream!
The trio of Sūtra, Illusion, and Mind; 1 The Eight Transmissions; 2 and the Assembled Realization— 3
As chief of the maṇḍala, you emanate and reabsorb them all.
To you, guru embodying all yidams and sacred Dharma,
I pray: bestow the supreme and common siddhis!
You are the noble lord of the assembly of outer śrāvakas,
Inner bodhisattvas, and secret ḍākas and ḍākinīs.
To you, sovereign Guru of the foremost assembly of ḍākinīs,
I pray: dispel the outer and inner obstacles!
You prophesied representations of your body, Concealed countless treasures as representations of your speech,
And entrusted your heart realization to those with karmic connections.
To you, Guru who has shown the greatest kindness to Tibet,
I pray: fulfill our wishes in accordance with the Dharma!
To you, my guru, and to all the lineage holders,
As I surrender myself and place all trust in you,
Look upon us with compassion, as you pledged to do:
Temporarily and ultimately, protect us from all fears!
Augment all favorable conditions: Long life, merit, strength and wealth, experience and realization!
Help us to attract the four types of admiration 4 And to fulfill the twofold benefit of self and other.
Grant your blessings that we may vanquish foes and obstructers
And actualize natural awareness, and thus take birth in Lotus Light!

A Sādhana of White Sarasvatī
Out of the state of emptiness, upon a lotus and moon,
I myself transform into Sarasvatī glowing like a moon,
Ablaze in youthful and graceful splendour with the major and minor marks of perfection, stunning to behold,
With one face and two arms raising a lapis lazuli vīṇā.
I am garbed in all the silken and jewelled adornments, and my two legs are crouching.
At my heart upon a moon-disc is a seed syllable Hrīṃ, white in colour,
From which light radiates out, causing the vital essence of conditioned existence and ultimate peace
As well as retention, eloquence and wisdom to be gathered in completely, without any exception,
And dissolve into the seed syllable at my heart.
Through this, I attain the state of a fearless master of speech.

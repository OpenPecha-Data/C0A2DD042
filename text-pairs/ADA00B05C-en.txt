Cloud Banks of Blessings A Prayer to Orgyen Rinpoche
Namo guru!
Padmākara, universal manifestation of the oceanic Three Roots,
Singular embodiment of the aspirations of the buddhas and their heirs,
Lake-born Vajra, the mere thought of whom dispels distress, care for me!
One and only guardian and friend to the Tibetan people, O precious Guru!
Kyema kyihüd! O compassionate heir to the victorious ones,
When sentient beings like me are oppressed by past karma,
Will you not lift us up with your hands of loving care?
Surely you will not leave us here, forsaken and alone!
O protector, as I call out to you in tuneful, longing prayer
Throughout the six times of the day and night,
Let the father watch over his children, precious Orgyen!
From the depths of my heart, I pray to you: inspire me with your blessings!
Purify my own and others’ bad karma, misdeeds and obscurations,
And dispel all obstacles to the accomplishment of sacred Dharma.
Inspire me with your blessings, I pray, so that all aspirations
Which accord with the Dharma may swiftly be fulfilled!

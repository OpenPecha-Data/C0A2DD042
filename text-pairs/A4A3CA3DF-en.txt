The Melodious Speech of Samantabhadra A Prayer to the Glorious Master Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye
Supreme illuminator of the Karma Kagyü teachings,
Powerful lord of speech, your wondrous qualities as vast as the ocean,
The waves of your virtuous activity extending in all directions—
Glorious and noble lama, at your feet I pray! 1
'Refutation', 'maintenance' and the universal science, together with their branches, 2
Your intelligence born of studying, contemplating and meditating upon
The ten sciences is without obstruction or hindrance—
To you whose discernment knows no bounds or limitation, I pray!
Cared for by Pema Wangchen 3 and the rest,
Holder of the awareness mantra of the compassionate Lord of Dance, 4
In your enlightened activity, you have the skill to discipline beings—
Glorious and supreme guru, to you I pray!
Born into the clan of Khyung, 5 with its line of accomplished masters,
Your karmic connection to pure Dharma, from past training, awoke,
And favourable conditions for the two domains 6 gathered spontaneously,
To you who are so wondrous and amazing, I pray!
Renouncing harmful acts, together with their basis, you disciplined your mind,
And applied yourself to the task of benefitting others, along with its underlying attitude,
Your perfect realization of the two phases utterly clear and apparent—
To you, the Vajra-holder maintaining the three sets of vows, I pray!
You relied upon several great guides, learned and accomplished leaders,
And, with diligence and benevolence, entered the ocean of sūtra and mantra.
To you, whose gift of jewel-like writings, advice and instructions,
Eradicates all spiritual poverty in fortunate disciples, I pray!
In the vajra words of Orgyen, knower of the past, present and future,
Which the universal sovereigns among siddhas revealed as treasures,
You were prophesied as an emanation of Vairocana and Vairotsana,
To you who were invested with such authority, I pray!
The victor and his heir, Khyentse Wangpo and Chokgyur Lingpa,
In their supreme vision, recognized you as an incarnation
Of Jetsün Tārānātha and Minling Terchen Gyurme Dorje—
To you who are praised as the supreme of guides, I pray!
With pure perception, you uphold all Buddha's teachings impartially,
And in your altruism, you seek to benefit all beings impartially,
Your conduct is to address directly whatever occurs—
To you who leads the noblest life of liberation, I pray!
In the isolated location of Tsadra Rinchen Drak,
You planted the victory banner of accomplishment within a single life,
And served the teachings with words transmitted in speech and text,
To you who spontaneously benefits both self and other, I pray!
The one who was so clearly praised in vajra statements,
Support for the Heruka's enlightened body, speech and mind,
To you, who for as long as the teachings remain in this world,
Act to bring about the most precious benefit of beings, I pray!
By the strength of our devotion and the power of unfailing interdependence,
May we never be separated from the glorious and supreme guru,
And within a single gathering in the great celestial citadel,
May we attain the supreme level of Vajrasattva himself!
As your tradition remains as steadfast and secure as a vajra,
And the profound and vast Five Treasures are proclaimed for evermore,
May I and others follow this excellent path through to its very conclusion,
And, with our wishes spontaneously fulfilled, may virtue shine in splendour!

Vajrakīla Prayer: A Rain of Accomplishments
Emaho!
Out of the dharmadhātu palace of great bliss,
The dharmakāya Samantabhadra and consort, to I pray:
Grant your blessings so I may realise the primordial nature!
Out of the sambhogakāya realm of the five certainties,
The sambhogakāya Garab Dorje, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so that clear light is uninterrupted!
Out of the glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain of Chāmara,
The nirmāṇakāya Padmākara, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so I may be empowered with immortal life!
Out of the blazing palace of the dark blue triangle,
The supreme wrathful one, Vajrakumāra, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so I may subdue damsi demons and enemies of the teachings!
Out of the vast expanse of great four kāya wisdom,
The supreme sons of the four families, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so I may accomplish enlightened action without hindrance!
In the wild charnel ground upon the ten fit for liberating,
The ten self-arisen wrathful ones, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so that beings welfare may come about without hindrance!
From the supreme sacred place at the peak of the king of mountains,
Garuḍa, the king of the wrathful, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so that the eight classes may be overcome!
From the palace of the triangle of swirling blood and fat,
Terma guardians, Ekajāṭī, Rāhula and Damchen, to you I pray:
Grant your blessings so that outer and inner obstacles may be pacified!
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May I utterly renounce all worldly, samsaric action,
Set out upon the pure, undeceiving path of the three secrets,
And obtain the supreme, ultimate vajra secret!

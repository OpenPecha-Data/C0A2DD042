Prayer to the Three Great Stūpas of Kathmandu
In Upacchandoha 1 —the land of Nepal—on the summit of Ox-Horn,
Appeared the blessings and relics of all the buddhas of times gone by;
Renowned as the wondrous Pakpa Shingkün— 2 ,
To this great, self-arisen stūpa, I pray!
When the Lord of Sages was the prince Mahāsattva, 'the Courageous',
He sacrificed his own body to feed a hungry tigress;
And on that very site the relics of enlightened action appeared—
To this great stūpa of awakening, I pray!
Built by a poultrywoman whose four sons sustained a karmic connection,
And, following their aspirations, took those from the Land of Snows as disciples;
To this fulfiller of prayers, known as Jarung Khashor, 3
This great stūpa which liberates upon sight, I pray!
Through the merit of devotedly prostrating to, making offerings before, and circumambulating
These three stūpas, which benefit all who come into contact with them,
May I and all others completely purify our negative karma, harmful actions and obscurations,
And swiftly attain the excellent fruition of perfect liberation and enlightenment!

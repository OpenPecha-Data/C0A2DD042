Aspiration at the Moment of Death
I take refuge in the body, speech, mind, qualities and activity of the noble gurus, who embody the Three Jewels and Three Roots.
I supplicate you: inspire me with your blessings, I pray!
Fulfil these aspirations of mine, I pray!
From this life onwards, throughout all my future lives, may I never develop even the slightest negative intention towards sentient beings, who are my very own parents!
May my positive intentions and actions flow uninterruptedly like a stream!
With the exception of the pure gaṇacakra feast on the path of Vajrayāna, which does not involve any desire to eat, may I never consume or be involved in the consumption of even the slightest trace of flesh or blood from any living being!
May I always recall these vows as vividly as I do now!
For as long as I lack the two qualities of possession and liberation, may I never incur even the slightest karmic debt based on the misuse of offerings!
May I be able to sacrifice my own body, speech and mind without the slightest impediment, even it is for the sake of just a single sentient being!
Through the power of the truth of the unchanging dharmatā nature and the infallible law of causality, may these selfless aspirations be entirely fulfilled!
Through the truth of the Three Jewels, may they be fulfilled!
Through the truth of the noble gurus, may they be fulfilled!

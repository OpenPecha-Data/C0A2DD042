Transference: Enlightenment Without Meditation from The Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse Prayer
In the middle of her body runs the central channel
As thick as a hollow reed arrow,
Empty and clear like a tube of light.
Its upper end is open at the brahma-aperture,
And its lower end extends below the navel centre.
Upon the notch at the heart-centre,
In the centre of a light green sphere of inner air ( lung )
Awareness clearly appears as a red syllable Hrīḥ .
A forearm’s length above the crown of one’s head
Appears the Buddha Amitābha, ‘Limitless Light’,
Complete with all the major and minor marks.
Then, the form of Amitābha
Melts into light and dissolves into me.
Through that, I too become Amitāyus,
Perfect in the very instant of recollection.
Emaho!
In the self-appearing realm, the ultimate Akaniṣṭha,
Is an expanse that teems with rainbow light of intense devotion.
Here, the embodiment of all objects of refuge, one’s own root guru,
In an extraordinary form and with a radiant body,
Abides as the essence of Buddha Amitābha.
With intense devotion, we pray:
Inspire us to accomplish the path of transference!
Inspire us to reach the realm of Akaniṣṭha!
May we capture the domain of dharmakāya expanse!
Phaṭ! ( Nirmāṇakāya ) Phaṭ! ( Sambhogakāya ) Phat! ( Dharmakāya ) Phat! ( Unchanging Vajrakāya ) Phaṭ! ( Abhisambodhikāya )

The Falling Rain of Blessings: A Prayer of Inspiration
oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya hūṃ phaṭ
Namo! Essence of all Buddhas,
Master of all Dharma,
Source of all blessings,
To the guru I pray!
Bless my body with your wisdom body,
Bless my speech with your wisdom speech,
Bless my mind with your wisdom mind,
Until I attain enlightenment, look on me with your compassion, inspire me with your blessing!
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ! Unborn is the dharmakāya, the body of truth and meaning;
Unceasing is the sambhogakāya, spontaneous perfection;
Unobstructed is the nirmāṇakāya, accomplishing the benefit of beings;
Unlimited are the noble buddha qualities, all perfect in you;
Uninterrupted is your enlightened activity, guiding sentient beings!
Gurus, yidams, ḍākinīs, dharmapālas,
Vīras, and vīriṇīs—you are the embodiment of all:
Great and noble Padmākara, here in person,
I have no other refuge, no other hope but you;
So to you I pray, Orgyen Rinpoche—
Hold me with your compassion, without ever parting!
Grant me the attainments in my practice, without any obstacle!
Carry out your enlightened activity, always without any effort!
Namo! I awaken the heart of the enlightened mind, the bodhicitta;
In this secret maṇḍala of Vajrakumāra
I shall practise exactly according to your teachings!
Grant your blessing so there be no obstacles to my practice!
Grant your blessings so I obtain the siddhis, ordinary and supreme!
vajra guru padma heruka sarva siddhi pala hūṃ āḥ harinisa ratsa hri ya sarva siddhi hūṃ
May all of you in the retinue: deities who carry out actions, vīras and vīriṇīs,
Vidyādharas, and ḍākinīs in their hundreds of thousands,
Look upon me, this child of devotion, with the love of your wisdom mind,
And let your blessings inspire my mind, inspire my heart, without any end!
Hūṃ Hūṃ Hūṃ

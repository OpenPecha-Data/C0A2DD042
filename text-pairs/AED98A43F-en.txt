Fully Blossomed Learning and Contemplation In Praise of the Great Spiritual Friend Jamyang Gyaltsen
Oṃ svasti.
From the cloudbanks of blessings from the Mañjughoṣa Guru 1
Falls the gentle rain of sūtra and mantra jewels
To be placed atop the victory banner of Kunga’s teachings— 2
Glorious guru, at your feet I pray!
Supreme of those endowed with splendid altruism and loving kindness,
You discern the ways of Dharma with threefold wisdom
In the fine mansion of authentic view, meditation and conduct—
Great spiritual friend, to you I pray!
May I and others develop impeccable ethical discipline,
May renunciation and twofold bodhicitta awaken in our being,
May we perfectly traverse the paths of the two stages
And ultimately attain the level of a Dharma Sovereign!

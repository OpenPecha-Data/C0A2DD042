A Short Prayer to the Abbot, the Master and the King
Vajra Speech, the family crown of all the Victors,
Self-arisen emanation appearing as a master of mantra,
Sole ally protecting the realm of Tibet, you are so kind,
Guru of Uḍḍiyāna, Second Buddha: to you I pray!
Lord who holds the secrets of all the Victors,
Regent of the Teacher appearing as an ordained spiritual friend,
First royal chaplain in this Cool Land, you are so kind,
Great Ācārya Bodhisattva: to you I pray!
Mañjuśrī, the knowledge and wisdom of all the Victors,
Intentionally appearing in our realm as a Dharma upholding king,
Charioteer of the teachings in the Snowy Land, you are so kind,
Emperor King Trisong Detsen: to you I pray!
May I and all who remember you one-pointedly, from the depth of our hearts,
Take hold of the treasury of the two accumulations’ qualities.
So may the long-standing tradition of these three, the immaculate Ancient Translations,
Forever grow, expand, and entirely fill the four continents of the world!

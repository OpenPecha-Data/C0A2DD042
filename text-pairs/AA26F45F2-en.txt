A Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Tenpai Nyima Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
Lord of sages, together with hosts of arhats, yidam deities and ḍākinīs,
And gurus of the three transmissions: through your blessings,
May the sun-like rebirth of this sublime holder of the teachings
Rise again in the sky of the four continents where beings dwell!
Great holder of the Early Translation teachings, both kama and terma ,
Glorious one, whose renown extends in every direction,
To bring delight to the lotus-like ears of your devoted followers,
May your sun-like rebirth return to this realm once again!
Through the excellent interdependence of your dance-like display,
Which lovingly inspires devoted disciples and protects the afflicted,
May the exceptional good fortune of your return
As a true sun of the teachings swiftly come to pass!

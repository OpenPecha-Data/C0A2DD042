A Brief Petitionary Offering to the Mātṛkā Pukkasī, Local Protectress of the Jarung Kashor Stūpa
Namo padmākarāya
Cleanse and purify it with raṃ yaṃ khaṃ ,
And bless it with oṃ āḥ hūṃ .
Hūṃ! In the land named Nepal,
In the charnel ground named Lhundrup Tsek,
At its famed stūpa the Jarung Kashor,
Resides the mātṛkā named Pukkasī.
Great and powerful, you protect this sacred land,
And though ultimately the Great Mother of the Expanse,
You reveal yourself in manifold forms to those to be tamed,
Appearing as a mātṛkā, local protectress of the sacred site.
Long ago, when the blood-drinking Heruka
Bound you and made you swear allegiance,
You became the custodian of the great maṇḍala.
Thus you were appointed to guard the Buddha’s teachings.
Do not stray from your oath so promised,
Natural expression of Vajrayoginī,
With your retinue of hundreds of thousands of mātṛkās,
I summon you from your sacred abode—come here now!
Be delighted, and come swiftly out of affection!
Take your seat at this place of practice and offering!
Outer offerings—perfectly arranged articles,
Inner offerings—cloud banks of sensual delights,
Secret offerings—gatherings of amṛta, rakta, and feast balis,
Innermost offerings—union, liberation and great bliss,
With these inexhaustible enjoyments,
I invoke you! I make offerings to you! May your wishes be fulfilled!
Please forgive my transgressions, confusions and faults!
I praise the glory of your qualities,
And honour you as a loyal ally.
Recall your previously made pledges,
And thus never waver from protecting
The great and secret teachings, their holders, The Wheel of Dharma, and the stūpa.
Dispel all misfortunate and harmful circumstances,
Increase all favourable and fortunate circumstances,
Turn living beings’ experience into virtue,
And annihilate all malevolent beings and spirits!
In short, carry out the activity
Of accomplishing just as we yogis wish!

The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel A Daily Sādhana of Noble Avalokiteśvara, the Great Compassionate One
Hrīḥ. Through a single moment of meditative recollection,
I appear out of emptiness, upon a seat of lotus and moon cushion,
As a white lotus marked with a syllable Hrīḥ,
Which transforms into Noble Avalokiteśvara, lord of compassion.
Brilliant white in colour with one face and four hands—
The first pair joined in front of his chest;
The lower right holding a precious crystal māla
And the left the stem of an eight-petalled white lotus.
He is smiling, with bright eyes and a prominent nose;
His blue-black locks are braided and tied up.
At his crown Buddha Amitābha takes his seat.
I visualise myself clearly in this way.
At my heart is an open, six-petalled white lotus.
At its centre stands the syllable Hrīḥ,
And around it, six syllables upon the six petals:
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ
Light radiates from my body, which is visualized in this way,
And I perceive everything as appearance and emptiness conjoined,
The form of the deity—Great Compassionate One, sovereign of the noble.
Light emanates from the mantra, and all sounds, including those of the elements,
Are heard as sound and emptiness, the resonance of mantra.
Freed from the limitations of arising, abiding and cessation of thought,
I rest in a state of wisdom that is beyond description and imagination.
With all this clearly visualized, I recite the six syllables
Of the vidyā-mantra continually and without omission.
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ

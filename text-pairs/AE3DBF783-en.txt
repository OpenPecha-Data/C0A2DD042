A Daily Long-Life Practice of Amitāyus
I take refuge in the guru, the immortal protector,
For sentient beings, I shall attain the level of a vidyādhara with power over life.
Ah. In the centre of this place of residence, the pure-land of great bliss,
Upon a lotus and moon, from the Hrīḥ of my own mind emerges Amitāyus, ‘Boundless Life’—
Bright red, smiling peacefully and holding a long-life vase in the gesture of equanimity.
He is in saṃbhogakāya form and sits amidst an expanse of rainbow-coloured rays of light.
At his heart within a locket formed by the sun and moon
Is a syllable Hrīḥ encircled by the mantra, from which rays of light shoot out
To collect the vital essence of the animate and inanimate world, which returns and dissolves into me,
And I thereby accomplish the deathless, indestructible vajra-kāya.
oṃ amaraṇi jīvantaye svāhā
The rainbow-body vajra-kāya, beyond the duality of arising and ceasing,
Acts in order to guide beings who pervade throughout the whole of space.
Through the virtue of this, may all fears of untimely death be pacified,
And may the light of longevity and auspiciousness stream forth for evermore.

Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
Outwardly he bears the name of a nirmāṇakāya incarnation,
Inwardly he brings about his own ruin through hopes and fears,
Secretly he is bereft of values, riches, pleasure and liberation— 1
May this vagabond beggar be physically well and mentally at ease!

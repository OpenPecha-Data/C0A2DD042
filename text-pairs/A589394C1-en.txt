The Confession and Fulfilment Practice Entitled 'Offering Clouds of Samantabhadra' Part of the 'Neck-Pouch Dagger’ (Purba Gulkhukma) Cycle
Hūṃ! Naturally arisen out of the state of bliss-emptiness, purity and equalness,
Appearance and existence as the manifest ground, the offering clouds of Samantabhadra—
Outer, inner, secret and innermost secret reality itself—
With all this, perfect in every way, arranged with many features,
And fully pervading throughout all infinite realms,
May the wishes of the great, glorious Vajrakumāra be fulfilled!
I, a beginner tormented by obscurations,
Have, in my ignorance and through lack of respect, carelessness and mental affliction,
Transgressed the solemn vajra oath that is difficult to contravene,
I acknowledge and confess all such errors and confusion from the depths of my heart!
Please grant the supreme accomplishment of unobscured purity!
Pacify unfavourable circumstances and adversity into absolute space,
Cause favourable circumstances to increase just like the waxing moon,
And grant your blessings so that all our wishes may be spontaneously fulfilled!

A Daily Practice of the Kagyé Taking Refuge and Generating Bodhicitta Main Visualization
In the guru, the glorious heruka, embodiment of all peaceful and wrathful deities,
I devotedly take refuge, and I generate the mind of awakening.
From the state of emptiness, instantly,
On the great vajra mountain upon a lotus, sun- and moon- disc seat,
The eight animal leaders, 1 the directional guardians and
The great gods,
My own awareness, the blazing blue syllable hūṃ ,
Transforms into the great awesome Mahottara Heruka,
His middle face is blue, right face white, and left face red.
His three right hands hold vajras and his three left hands hold skull-cups.
He is adorned with the heruka and charnel-ground ornaments,
And joined in union with the great consort Dhātvīśvarī Namshalma.
His head is adorned by Samantabhadras of the five families.
In his form the maṇḍalas of the nine herukas are perfected.
In his heart rests his own perfect likeness as the jñānasattva.
In the heart of the jñānasattva is Samantabhadra.
And in Samantabhadra’s heart is a vajra.
At its centre is a locket of sun and moon containing a blue hūṃ ,
Lucid, limpid and unchanging.
The mantra-mālā radiates
To invoke the wisdom minds of the peaceful and wrathful deities and accomplish twofold benefit.
And the environment and beings arise as the maṇḍala of the awesome heruka.
oṃ bodhicitta-mahā-sukha-jñāna-dhātu āḥ ||
oṃ vajra-krodha-mahā-śrī-heruka hūṃ phaṭ | mahā-krodhīśvarī sattvaṃ | oṃ ru lu ru lu hūṃ byoḥ hūṃ ||
oṃ vajra-caṇḍa-sarva-ḍuṣtāntaka hana daha paca hūṃ phaṭ ||
Within luminosity the perception of the deity dissolves.
Then again, I arise in the deity’s genuine form.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ

Prayer to Avalokiteśvara
To beings drowning in saṃsāra terrifying ocean,
You manifest as the master of non-referential compassion,
Guide on the path of excellent teachings, Sun of Speech,
Lama Avalokiteśvara, to you I pray!
In every lifetime, may the protector Avalokiteśvara
Always remain on my crown without ever separating.
Bless me so that, practising the true meaning of his speech correctly,
I may establish the roots of everlasting bliss and happiness!

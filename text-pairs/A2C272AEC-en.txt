The Mantra Recitation and Visualization 5. Offerings and Praise III. Conclusion An Additional Offering to the Household or Drala Deities
Homage to the guru, yidam, and dākiṇī!
In the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Supreme Assembly,
I take refuge until awakening.
Through the merit of practicing generosity and so forth,
May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of beings.
oṃ vajrāmṛtakuṇḍalī hana hana hūṃ phaṭ
oṃ svabhāva-śuddhāh sarva-dharmāḥ svabhāva-śuddho’ham
Within the state of emptiness, free from all reference,
The animals’ flesh, blood, and warmth,
Their breath and mind—the whole of their being–
Is primordially, in essence, the five female buddhas
And, in appearance, the gathering of the five male buddhas,
Perfectly replete in their form and attire.
They radiate out sensual delights beyond measure.
In the space before me is a celestial palace
Bedecked with perfect attributes and decoration.
Inside is a multicolored, four-petalled lotus,
On top of which are elephants, lions, stallions,
Peacocks, and jīvaṃjīva birds,
All supporting a jewel throne on top of which
Are lotuses, sun, and moon discs.
Seated there are the five family forms of Amitāyus,
White, dark blue, yellow, red, and green.
Each has one face and two hands and is holding
A vase of immortality in the mudrā of equipoise.
They embrace their natural radiance, the five supreme consorts,
The queens of space, who hold long-life vases marked with their insignia.
They are all adorned with silks and jewels
And are seated in the vajra and lotus postures
Amid a swirling expanse of light.
Surrounding them, on an eight-petalled lotus,
Are the offering goddesses, such as Graceful Lady.
At the four gates are the four Swift Vajra Ladies.
In the space between are the Three Roots long-life deities—
All ablaze with the splendor of blessings.
From the ‘oṃ āḥ hūṃ’ marking their three places,
Light rays radiate out
Inviting the assembly of wisdom deities to come.
Guardians of all beings without exception,
Divine conquerors of the host of demons,
Who know all things, just as they are—
Blessed ones and your retinues, please come to this place!
padmakamalāya sattvaṃ | vajrasamajaḥ | jaḥ hūṃ baṃ hoḥ | atipuhoḥ pratīccha hoḥ |
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ. Actual offerings and those sprung forth from the mind,
Cloud-banks of Samantabhadra’s offerings,
Filling the whole expanse of dharmadhātu—
I offer them to you, immortal long-life deities!
oṃ vajra arghaṃ pādyaṃ puṣpe dhūpe aloke gandhe naivedye śabda oṃ āḥ hūṃ
The animals’ flesh, blood, and warmth,
Their breath and mind—the whole of their being
Is primordially, in essence, the five female buddhas
And, in appearance, the gathering of the five male buddhas,
Perfectly replete in their form and attire.
They radiate out sensual delights beyond measure.
All of this I present with devotion to you,
Five family deities of the long-life maṇḍala.
Please partake of these offerings with unbounded delight!
Please protect us temporarily from the fear of death
And ultimately from every kind of suffering
Inherent in saṃsāra and the lower realms!
oṃ buddha āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ vajra āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ ratna āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ padma āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ karma āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ |
oṃ namo bhagavate | aparimitāyurjñāna-suviniścitatejo-rājayā | tathāgatāya | arhate samyak-sambuddhāya | tadyathā | oṃ puṇye puṇye | mahā-puṇye | aparamita-puṇye | aparamita-puṇye jñāna-sambhāropacite | oṃ sarva-saṃskāra pariśuddha-dharmate gagana-samudgate svabhāva-viśuddhe mahānaya-parivāre svāhā
From my heart center, light rays stream out,
Invoking the wisdom hearts of the deities in front, so that they project light rays too.
These in turn gather back the life-essence of existence and peace,
And in particular the essence of the five elements.
These essences dissolve into me and the practice focus.
Our depleted five elements are thereby revitalized
And we attain the long-life empowerment of the five families.
oṃ vajra arghaṃ pādyaṃ puṣpe dhūpe aloke gandhe naivedye śabda oṃ āḥ hūṃ
You are the essence of the five wisdoms—
You, Amitāyus of the five buddha families
United with your consorts, the five elements utterly pure.
Five family long-life lords, I praise you!
Assembly of blessed long-life deities, I beseech you!
Revitalize the depleted life force and merit
Of myself and all infinite beings,
And grant us the long-life empowerments and siddhis of the five families!
The entire maṇḍala of immortality in the sky before me, the support and supported, melts into light as the essence of great bliss, and dissolves into me and the practice focus. Our depleted five elements are thereby revitalized and we attain every one of the longevity and wisdom siddhis of the five families.
Out of emptiness appears the syllable ti , from which emerge the animals to be released, beautiful in appearance and pleasant to the senses, their figures healthy and strong. Clouds of sensual delights issue from their breath, their fur and their feathers. Each cloud multiplies thousands of times, pervading the whole of space with these sensory delights. The deities and guardians are delighted by this delectable feast, replete with the pleasures of the six senses.
namaḥ sarva tathāgatebhayo viśva mukhebhyaḥ sarvathākhaṃ udgate spharaṇa imaṃ gagana khaṃ svāhā
oṃ vajra-spharaṇa khaṃ
Kyé! So that these animals, the supreme wealth of humans,
May attain both temporary and lasting happiness,
We entrust them to you, the Three Jewels.
O Three Jewels, please care for them with compassion!
These offerings we make in devotion to the Three Roots.
O Three Roots, please grant your blessings!
May they become supports for the Dharma protectors and wealth deities.
May the guardians and wealth deities delight in them.

The Great Treasure of a Hundred Blessings A Prayer for the Long Life of Ḍākinī Muntso Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
As the ceaseless natural expression of primordial emptiness,
Myriad beautiful forms emanate in a spontaneously perfect display —
Through the activity of the oceanic deities of the three roots,
May the auspiciousness of a great shower of virtue, excellence and blessings rain down!
To wearied beings who fall endlessly into the ocean of existence,
Grant the supreme light of pure primordial wisdom!
To the reverend one skilled in proclaiming
A thousand sweet sounds that delight the lake-born goddess, we pray!
May your life remain secure in the immutable vajra nature!
May your enlightened activity extend continuously in all directions!
With pure commitments among all connections, teacher and patrons,
May the welfare of the teachings and beings be sustained long into the future!
Through the profound aspirations of the victorious sources of refuge
The force of the powerful guardians of the teachings,
And our sincere hopes and aspirations made with unwavering motivation,
May there be extensive signs of the fulfilment of our wishes!

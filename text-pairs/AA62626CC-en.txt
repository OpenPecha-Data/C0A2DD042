Prayer to Khenpo Ngawang Palzang
Namo guru!
Inseparable from Padmākara, the face and embodiment of the Three Roots,
And Longchenpa, the omniscient and perfectly awakened,
Lord of speech, Ledrel Tsal,
Ösal Rinchen Nyingpo, to you I pray:
Inspire me always with your blessings,
Purify my faults and impairments and breakages of samaya,
Transfer all your wisdom realization directly into my mind,
And cause me to attain the supreme vajrakāya rainbow body!

Food Offering Prayer
Ho! The aggregates, elements and sense organs of my body
Are in essence the three seats of completeness. 1
In this maṇḍala of the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities
All movement is great bliss.
The unsurpassable vajra samaya,
The great cloud of bodhicitta,
All this I enjoy in the state of indivisible equality.
May we perfect the accumulations of the yogic path
Without any obscuration arising due to food
And may the generous patron, too,
Enjoy the fruits of the Mahāyāna.

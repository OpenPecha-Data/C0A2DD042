Prayer to Akṣobhya
Emaho!
Through the power of your pure past intentions and prayers of aspiration,
Now, to the east, in the supreme pureland of Abhirati—Manifest Joy,
You are the fully awakened victorious one Akṣobhya,
Protector of beings—to you I pray.
You have found wisdom endowed with the ten powers
And you see all that is knowable just as it is,
While I am plagued by a hundred terrors, such as ageing and death.
Look upon me now as I turn to you in search of refuge!
Protector, you who gaze upon all infinite beings
With great compassion and unimpeded vision,
Be a refuge to me, as I am utterly exhausted,
Hopelessly tormented by anxiety and dread.
Protector, equipped with the might of the ten powers
And the strength and capacity to protect all beings,
You who possess vajra fortitude beyond compare,
Swiftly grant me the supreme release from suffering.
It is the nature of things that beings suffer for their actions,
But I am excessively tormented by sickness and pain,
Adversity and unbearable anxiety and apprehension.
Bereft am I of refuge, dispirited and fatigued.
Thus, when I cry out to you in anguish and despair,
Disturbed as I am by delusion, doubt and speculation,
Please, O protector whose vision is unobstructed,
Consider me swiftly in your compassionate wisdom.
Once I am relieved of this anxiety and suffering,
May I discover the jubilation of freedom from fear,
And may you confer the great celebratory attainment
Of spontaneously accomplishing my own and others' aims.

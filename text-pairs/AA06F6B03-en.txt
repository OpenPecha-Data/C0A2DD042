Aspiration Addressed to the Gurus of the Ngor Tradition 1
Kunga Zangpo, lauded in the Victor’s prophecy, 2
Sempa Chenpo, 3 heart-son of the Victorious One,
Noble Kunga Wangchuk, 4 the Conqueror’s regent,
Sönam Sengé, 5 crown adornment of all the learned,
Reverend Könchok Pal, 6 mighty lord of knowledge and love,
Great Müchen Sangye Rinchen, 7
Mañjughoṣa in person, all-knowing Ngorchen,
Noble Nirābhoga, 8 to you I pray!
May I master all the profound and vast instructions
Of the sūtra and mantra in general and especially the Sakya’s
Essential instructions with their fourfold criteria of validity 9
And the commentarial exposition of the king of tantras.
Bless me, I pray, so that I may remain inseparable
From you, reverend and noble gurus, immaculate in
Your lifestyle and maintenance of ethical discipline
And in your practice, conduct, and view of emptiness.

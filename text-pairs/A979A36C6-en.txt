Brief Windhorse Invocation
Ho! The great flag of the windhorse, auspicious and sweet‑sounding far and wide
Sends out a vast cloud of exquisite offerings, like those of Samantabhadra.
Through this offering, we pray, may the Three Roots—guru, deva and ḍākinī—protectors, dralas, and gods in action,
Make all our aspirations be spontaneously fulfilled!

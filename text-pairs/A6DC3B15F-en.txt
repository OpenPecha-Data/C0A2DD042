The Last Testament of Kathok Dampa Deshek
May the teachings of the Buddha remain for long,
May the king of all vehicles flourish and spread,
May the lives of the holders of the teachings be secure,
May all obstructions to the teachings be eradicated entirely,
And may this aspiration be a cause for all beings attaining enlightenment.

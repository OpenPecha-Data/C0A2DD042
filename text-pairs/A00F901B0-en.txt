A Prayer of Aspiration for the Mountain of Glory
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
My whole perception is the utterly pure realm of Lotus Light,
Arrayed in complete perfection as the Copper Coloured Mountain of Glory, in which is
The limitless palace of the three kāyas, full of joy and happiness.
On the lower storey, in the great Nirmāṇakāya shrine room,
Is the Lotus-born Guru of Orgyen, embodiment of the three roots,
Surrounded by his entourage of vidyādharas, pawos and khandros,
Where the sound of the teachings of the Secret Mantra Vajrayāna rings out.
On the middle storey in the great mansion of the Sambhogakāya
Dwells the supreme Great Compassionate One, Avalokiteśvara,
Surrounded by his retinue of buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Above is the limitless heavenly realm of the Dharmakāya, in the centre of which
Resides the teacher and protector, Amitābha,
Surrounded by his entourage, who are in nature no different from him.
So bringing to mind as clearly as if actually present
The pure realms of the three kāyas―the support and that which is supported―
And through the power of paying homage, making offerings and prayer out of faith and devotion,
May I and others―fortunate students of the master―
When death comes, experience neither suffering nor sorrow, and
May Kharchen Za and other ḍākinīs come to show us the way
So we may be born in the realm of Lotus Light and
Be ripened and liberated as the prophecies foretold, perfecting the five paths and ten stages.
May we be inseparable from the vast expanse of the wisdom mind of the Lord of Orgyen!

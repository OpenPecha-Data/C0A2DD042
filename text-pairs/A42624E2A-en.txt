A Practice of Paying Homage and Making Offerings to the Sixteen Elders
In the centre of a golden ground made of radiant light,
Is the jewelled palace without steps or tiered pediments,
Surrounded by palm trees and fragrant streams.
In its centre, upon a thousand-petalled lotus,
Is the supreme sage together with the sixteen elders,
Surrounded by many śrāvaka arhats:
Consider us with compassion: come now, we pray!
We present offerings, auspicious substances and the seven emblems of royalty,
All drawn upon the chariot of the seven-branch practice.
Victorious one, supreme teacher, your sacred Dharma
Includes the sūtra and abhidharma collections,
And that which highlights the rules of proper conduct,
Which is the collection of the vinaya dharma.
The sixteen noble elders who uphold these teachings,
Appear as śrāvakas for the sake of the teachings and beings,
Even though they have attained the level beyond training,
And will remain as long as the teachings endure—to them I pay homage!
Great shrine-like monuments of infinite pure qualities,
Such as the applications of mindfulness and the rest,
Their bodies like mountains of burnished gold:
Teacher and sages, to you we pay homage!
Grant your blessings so that the teachings and their holders flourish!

With the supreme training in higher ethical discipline,
The foundation of the teachings, the noble vinaya,
Untainted by protection from fear or hopes for advantage,
But recognizing the nature of saṃsāra as true suffering,
And avoiding its cause, the true origin,
May we practise the true path of infallible cause and effect,
Examine the foundation of virtuous practice, so as to avoid harm to others together with its cause,
And with the discipline of avoiding two hundred and fifty infractions,
And the discipline of maintaining the seventeen bases,
Untainted by violations, infractions or partial offences,
And made pure through the three basic rituals, 1
May we realize the four results—stream-entry and the rest,
And may we follow the higher training in meditative concentration
And the higher training in wisdom, so that our pure form
Is increasingly refined through the eight stages,
And actualizing true cessation, we attain the level of an arhat!

The Gaṇḍī Sūtr
Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Bhagavān was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, in the Kalandaka­nivāpa near Rājagṛha, together with a great saṅgha of a thousand monks and a great gathering of bodhisattvas
They were all worthy ones. Their contaminations were exhausted, their duties fulfilled, their work concluded, their burdens put down, their personal welfare attained, their bonds to existence destroyed, and their minds fully liberated through perfect knowledge
At that time, King Prasenajit arose from his seat and went to meet the Bhagavān
He bowed his head down at the feet of the Bhagavān an
addressed him with these words
“Bhagavān, in the future, during times of conflict, all beings will have evil minds, quarrelsome minds filled with desire, hatred, and delusion
While intensely coveting others’ possessions an
striving to devour one another
they will cause the previous period when teachings were given by the Bhagavān to decline
They will cause the abandonment of the true Dharma
They will go against the Buddha, the Dharma, and those who are free of desire. Please teach a way to eliminate such behavior so that beings may be strongly inclined to awakening.
Thus entreated, the Bhagavān declared
“King, since you make this request for the sake of the welfare of all beings, for their benefit and happiness, and in order to protect the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha, your inquiry is excellent! Excellent
Therefore, listen closely and keep this in mind
I will explain.
Thereupon, the Bhagavān entered the meditative absorption called resounding everywhere 
When the Bhagavān entered that meditative absorption, all hells were terminated
All those who had been filled with hatred became free from their hatred and wholly devoted to the mind of awakening
Then the Bhagavān asked, “Prasenajit, did you see, or hear, or understand, or realize?
“Bhagavān, I saw
Blissful One, I saw
I comprehended, understood, recognized, and realized!
The Bhagavān said
“Prasenajit, this is the mother of all beings. She gives birth to buddhas and bodhisattvas
She is venerated, worshiped, contemplated, and cultivated by all hearers, solitary buddhas, and perfect buddhas
Taking the form of the sound of the Perfection of Insight, she nurtures all beings
She is the vanquisher of all non-Buddhists
the pacifier of angry thoughts
the subduer of sinful thoughts
the dispeller of hateful thoughts
the destroyer of deluded thoughts, an
the banisher of lustful thoughts
She is the protector of the mind of awakening
the intensifier of the mind of buddhas, an
the supporter for the genesis of buddhas
She is the destroyer of all fights, quarrels, strife, conflicts, miseries, and all those of bad character who contravene the monastic code
She is the pacifier of sudden illness and death and [of untimely death, epidemics, and so forth.
She is the pacifier [of sudden illness and death and] of untimely death, epidemics, and so forth
She is the subduer of foreign armies
destroyer of Māra , an
dispeller of torments
She is the extender of the fortunate era
bestower of long life and freedom from disease
pacifier of the dread of death, an
intensifier of freedom and prosperity
To those who hear this and rejoice, she bestows results, like a wish-fulfilling gem
The Mother, the Perfection of Insight, is present in the form of the gaṇḍī.
Having heard this, deep conviction rose in King Prasenajit
and he entreated the Bhagavān
“Bhagavān, what is the size of this gaṇḍī
What is its color
What are its specifications
How is it to be struck
By what is it to be struck
At what time, on what occasion, and for how long should it be struck
How should it be placed?
Thus entreated, the Bhagavān declared
“As for the wood you wish to use, You should investigate with great effort: Sandalwood, Bengal quince, bastard teak, Sacred fig, and red sandalwood tree, “Indian walnut, palmyra, kingshuk tree, Aloe wood, false mangosteen, Mango, walnut, myrobalan tree, Tintisara, and aśoka
“If all of these are absent, You should try the mulberry tree
King, if despite your efforts None of these are present, do not make it
“If made without measure and from bad wood
The sound will not emerge when struck
When such a Mother of the Buddhas is struck
Harm will surely arise in the land
“As for the monks in the temple, Their minds will thus be discordant
They will be afflicted with disease, An
there will be all sorts of quarrels
“Non-Buddhists will be empowered An
māras will likewise come to the fore
Due to many noxious nāgas, Crops will fail
“In that kingdom many beings Will be destroyed
Temples also will be destroyed, An
the Dharma will decline as well
“Demonic gods will cause unruliness Within the saṅgha of monks
Thus, knowing all this well, Proceed with careful inspection
“As for measurements: the small ends should be eight fingers. Make the main body eighty-four fingers
Make it six fingers in breadth And two fingers in height
“Using the measurements of finger joints, The measure to the four corners is two fingers
The perfect balance is made very clear
The two ends are like the head of a frog
“After that, cut the striker From the same wood block
Measuring twelve fingers, It is rounded and has mongoose heads at both ends
“The size of the handle is also like that. It should be very smooth and evenly ribbed
Thus, it is meant to be struck. Below, make a stand for it
“Place it above the temple gate, Or place it above the central gate
As for its consecration, It is the very stable Dharma body
“It is unproduced, indestructible, And primordially unborn virtue
Having been consecrated as such, The gaṇḍī’s eyes are opened
“[Next,] having opened the gaṇḍī’s eyes
“Next, [having opened the gaṇḍī’s eyes,] One must strike it to increasingly produce sound Throughout the temple, As if adorned by seven nāgas
“Thereafter, one should pay homage to the Three Jewels And then strike the gaṇḍī
One should then sound the cymbal three times And beat the Dharma drums
“Cleansing the gaṇḍī with flower-petal wate
At mealtime, sunrise, and sunset, Strike it three times at the three intervals
When it is time for bathing, let it resound twice
“It should be struck consecutively without hesitation To prevent sudden harm And likewise quarrels, disputes, Lightning, and great devastation. “It should be struck to invite the elders And to pacify plagues and famines
It should be struck constantly at all times By monks and novices
“During monthly purification, It should be struck by laypeople as well
All its qualities being complete
It should be adorned by seven nāgas
“O King, when throughout the land That gaṇḍī resounds
The year will be good there, With splendor, fame, and all desirable things
“There will be no fear of foreign armies, An
the crops will never fail
With the wealth of the Buddha’s blessings, Māras will be tamed there
“The Dharma drum will thunder everywhere, Right up to the summit of existence
The worlds of hell and pretas Will undoubtedly be destroyed
“Everyone will have enduring conviction in the Buddha, An
everyone will be devoted to the Dharma
There, the saṅgha will be disciplined, An
the wise will flourish as well
“Lust, hate, and delusion Will subside there
The king will live long and uphold the Dharma, And he will have every happiness
“O King, in every temple, When beating the Dharma drum, Its sound will be renowned In the pathways of peoples’ ears
“Those who hear it four times a day Will attain spiritual awakening
Those who rejoice from the heart Will undoubtedly be free
“Hearing just once The Gaṇḍī Sūtra, One will remember one’s former lives
Where this best among sūtras is present, That land will be prosperous
“[Those who] observe it at all times, Read it aloud, worship it
“Those who [observe it at all times, Read it aloud, worship it, And] keep it in mind Will be freed from evil.
When the Bhagavān had said this
King Prasenajit paid his respects to the Bhagavān repeatedly and then departed
When the Bhagavān had spoken these words
the entire assembly, along with the world with its gods, humans, asuras, garuḍas, and gandharvas, rejoiced an
praised what the Bhagavān had said
This completes “The Gaṇḍī Sūtra.

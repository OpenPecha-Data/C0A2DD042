Guru Yoga
In the sky before me and above my head,
Upon the blossoming lotus of my devoted mind,
Is the manifestation of mother Yeshe Tsogyal,
Sukha Vajra Tsal, who embodies every form of refuge—
Remain constantly without ever parting,
And bless my three doors as the three vajras!
Kyé! Mother, wisdom ḍākinī, care for me!
Grant your blessings so that I may find freedom here and now
In the great unborn and primordially pure ground,
Untainted by the stains of a deluded mind—
The key point of clear light awareness, which is the unerring meaning
Of the Great Perfection, the essence of all phenomena.
Inseparable from your wisdom mind, O Protectress,
May I instantly obtain your empowerment and blessing
And gain the glory of twofold benefit in this very lifetime!

Siṃhamukhā Lineage Prayer
Omnipresent lord of existence and quiescence, Samantabhadra Heruka,
The wisdom ḍākinī Siṃhamukhā and Vimalamitra,
Padmākara and the sovereign lord Trisong Detsen—
To you I pray: overcome all curses and harmful influences!
Vairotsana, Namkhé Nyingpo, Langdro Könchok Jungné,
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Pema Yeshe Dorje, 1
And all dharma-keeping vidyādharas, root and lineage gurus—
To you I pray: overcome all curses and harmful influences!
Let the tent that guards against enemies and harmful influences be secure.
Employ the defensive weapons and obliterate all forms of evil sorcery.
Liberate consciousness into basic space and bring about awakening
Within the essence of the ḍākinī, the wisdom of our very own awareness.

Pacifying the Turmoil of the Mamos: A Concise Liturgy
Jo. Mamos and Ḍākinīs of all that appears and exists,
I offer you this torma of inexhaustible bliss and emptiness –
May all the troubles that infuriate the inner and outer Mamos be pacified
And the accomplishment of great spontaneous bliss bestowed!
sarva ḍāka ḍākinī saparivāra mahā baliṃ te khāhi
oṃ vajra sattva āḥ

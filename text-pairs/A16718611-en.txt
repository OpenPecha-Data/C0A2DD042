A Song to Delight Vaiśravaṇa Praise of the Great King Vaiśravaṇa
Hūṃ. Within the jewelled palace, vast and beautiful,
Is the mighty Vaiśravaṇa upon a lion throne,
Resplendent at the head of millions of treasure-keepers—
Magnificent one, golden in colour, to you I offer praise.
Holding a jewelled banner and wish-granting mongoose,
Wearing jewelled ornaments and a resplendent crown,
You let fall from your mouth a rain of precious gems —
Vaiśravaṇa, dispeller of all poverty, to you I offer praise.
You conquer all external forces without exception,
And control the excellent vase, wish-granting tree,
Jewel tree, magic pool and wishing cow of plenty—
Great master of the yakṣas’ wealth, to you I offer praise.
The yakṣas Jambhala, Pūrṇabhadra,
Kubera, Sañjñeya,
Āṭavaka, Pañcika, and Picikuṇḍalin,
Each holding their own hand implements and riding horses—
To the oceanic retinue of yakṣas, I offer praise.
Accept this torma, this vast source of offerings,
And care for us and those around us as you would your own children.
Pulverize malicious enemies and obstructing forces,
And swiftly carry out the various forms of activity—
Pacifying, enriching, magnetizing and subjugating—as we request you.
Guard the precious teachings of the Muni,
Elevate the status of those who hold the lineage,
Extend the dominion of the Dharma-protecting king,
And carry out your activity of bringing happiness to this world.

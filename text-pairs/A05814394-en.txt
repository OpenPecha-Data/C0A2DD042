Prayer to Khandro Tsering Chödrön
Homage to the lama!
Outwardly, you are Sarasvatī, the daughter of Brahmā,
Inwardly, you are the youthful lady Tārā,
Secretly, you are the innate Vajravārāhī,
You who embody them all—ḍākinī of the Lakar family—may you reign supreme!
The great master of Orgyen knows all past, present and future, and with his vajra words
The revealers of the terma treasures, those universal kings of realization,
Have praised you in their predictions, undisputed,
As the emanation of Shelkar Dorje Tso 1 —and so to you I pray!
Just as they foretold in their vajra prophecies,
You joined Padma Yeshe Dorje, 2 supreme embodiment of skilful means,
As the consort symbolizing wisdom and emptiness—
Lady of great bliss, granter of the four joys, to you I pray!
Moved by a devotion so deep that I perceive lama and consort as indivisible,
From the core of my heart I pray: on such a person as me
Grant your blessings, so that the bliss-emptiness of caṇḍāli is invoked,
And the blissful warmth and wisdom are set ablaze!
Through the blessings of such a prayer as this,
May my mind be turned towards the Dharma,
May Dharma progress along the path, and, as delusory appearances
Are purified into wisdom, may I come to master the bodhicitta supreme!
In this and all my future lives, hold me in your compassion!
At all times and in any situation, grant me your blessing, I pray!
For in this life, the next and in the bardo state,
O Jetsünma, there is no other source of hope for me but you!

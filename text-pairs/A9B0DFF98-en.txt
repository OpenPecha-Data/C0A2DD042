The Guru Yoga of the Profound Path
Hūṃ! Above my head, on a lotus and sun-disk seat,
Is the Guru, Dorje Tötreng Tsal,
Dark blue and extremely wrathful,
His mouth gaping open, baring his fangs, with his three eyes open wide,
His hair is dark red and tied up in braids,
His two feet are in striding posture, intimidating enemies and obstructing forces.
In his right hand, he holds aloft a vajra made of meteoric iron,
And with his left, he holds a bell against his hip.
He appears terrifying, ornamented with all the charnel ground accoutrements.
Fiercely proclaiming Hūṃ, he causes the three worlds to tremble.
Surrounded by a mass of flame that destroys harmful influences and obstacle-makers.
Gurus of the three kāyas, yidam deities,
Wisdom ḍākinīs and guardians,
All gather in the sky like clouds,
And dissolve into the guru, embodiment of all the buddha families,
To the vajra guru, the embodiment of all,
In devotion, I pay homage. I take refuge in you.
My own body, speech and mind
I offer to you in servitude.
Purify all my harmful actions, obscurations, impairments and breakages.
Pacify all adversity and obstacles!
Bless my body, speech and mind!
And grant me the attainments, both ordinary and supreme!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
In the dharmadhātu palace of Akaniṣṭa,
Is the Guru of Orgyen, the dharmakāya Vajradhāra,
With fervent faith and devotion, I pray to you:
Shower down your blessings and attainments!
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
In the spontaneously perfect palace of great bliss,
Are the saṃbhogakāya forms, the five classes of Tötreng.
With fervent faith and devotion, I pray to you:
Shower down your blessings and attainments!
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
In the heavenly realm for guiding beings to be trained,
Are the eight manifestation of the Guru.
With fervent faith and devotion, I pray to you:
Shower down your blessings and attainments!
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
Glorious embodiment of all three kāyas,
Guru Dorje Drakpo Tsal,
With fervent faith and devotion, I pray to you:
Shower down your blessings and attainments!
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
In the dharmakāya palace of appearance and existence,
Are the lamas of the non-sectarian lineage.
With fervent faith and devotion, I pray to you:
Shower down your blessings and attainments!
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
In the heavenly realm of my own pure perception,
Is Orgyen Lerab Lingpa.
With fervent faith and devotion, I pray to you:
Shower down your blessings and attainments!
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
Lamas, please inspire me with your blessings!
On my body, bestow the supreme empowerment of enlightened form!
On my voice, bestow the supreme empowerment of enlightened speech!
On my mind, bestow the supreme empowerment of enlightened wisdom!
Grant me the supreme empowerment of inseparability!
Perfect the strength of my realization,
And cause me to accomplish the four kinds of activity!
The guru dissolves into me and we merge inseparably.
My mind blends with his wisdom mind in the dharmadhātu.
In that space, the ongoing experience of the absolute lama,
Do not alter, but simply settle and rest at ease.

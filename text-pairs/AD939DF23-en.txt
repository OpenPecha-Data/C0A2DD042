A Daily Practice of Mañjuśrī Yamāntaka
Ayai! From the dharmadhātu, the empty space of É as such,
Which is unborn and does not cease,
I bring to mind that which is naturally present:
Within the great palace of Ai,
Not created through causes and conditions,
Mañjuśrī arises out of awareness, like a fish leaping from water,
In a form of overwhelming splendour,
And standing upon nāgas, nyen , earth lords, rudras,
Buffaloes, sun, moon and lotus.
He has three faces, six arms and four striding feet,
The right face is white, the left face red, and the central face blue.
In his right hands he holds a wheel, sword and vajra;
With his left hands he holds a club and wooden pestle and makes a threatening mudrā.
The wrathful ones of the five families adorn his crown
And he has all the glorious attributes and ornaments of the charnel ground.
His consort, indivisible within the dharmadhātu,
Is dark blue and proffers a heart and blood-filled skullcup.
As emanations, the eight deities of adornment
And the ten of wisdom wrath are all present.
The deities emanate countless wrathful hosts
And an effusion of vajra sparks.
Visualize them all as appearing yet unreal.
Upon a sun at Yamāntaka’s heart,
The mantra garland revolves around a syllable Hūṃ,
Emitting and absorbing rays of light to fulfil the twofold aims.
All appearance and existence arises as the wisdom intent
In which deity and mantra of the Great Awesome One are indivisible.
oṃ āḥ krodhika yamāntaka hana matha bhañja hūṃ phaṭ
The deity’s appearance dissolves into the sphere of luminosity.
Then arises once again in the form of overwhelming splendour.
Vajra kāvāci rakṣa haṃ
Through the positivity and merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of wrathful Mañjuśrī, and thereby
Every single sentient being
Reach his state of perfection too.

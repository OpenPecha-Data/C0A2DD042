Guru Sādhana of the Omniscient Dolpopa
Ah. All the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are absorbed into absolute space.
Out of meditative concentration with its three immovable factors
And my own pure awareness, genuine and unaltered,
Arises the nirmāṇakāya form embodying the three families
As a sphere of subtle essence and controlled vital force.
In absorption’s creative play, I recollect
The great miracle of emanating and reabsorbing.
Upon seats of lotus and moon disc
Is the omniscient Prajñādhvaja, 1
White with a tinge of red, glowing and corpulent,
Beautifully attired in the three dharma robes,
And, on his head, the orange hat of a paṇḍita.
He seats in playful ease, his two feet loosely crossed.
His two hands rest upon his knees,
And with vajra gaze he looks into space.
From the four syllables at his four centres light radiates out
Invoking the jñānasattva, who dissolves into him.
Encountering the view of my own intrinsic awareness, I prostrate.
With outer, inner and secret gifts, I make offerings.
And for your body, speech, mind, qualities and activity, I offer praise.
At his heart centre is Lokeśvara—Lord of the World,
Brilliant white with his right hand in the gesture of supreme giving
And his left in the mudrā of granting refuge and holding a lotus.
He stands in the bodhisattva posture and in the centre of his heart
Is Mañjuśrī, orange in colour and holding sword and book.
In the centre of his heart is the Lord of Secrets, neither peaceful nor wrathful,
Holding vajra and bell and at his heart,
A blazing pavilion of light,
In which there is a Hūṃ marked on its interior by Hrīḥ and Dhīḥ.
From this emanates the sound of the vajra mantra,
Whereby the benefit of self and other is accomplished.
Environment and inhabitants are perfected as maṇḍala of victorious ones,
And in great indivisible equality, I rest.

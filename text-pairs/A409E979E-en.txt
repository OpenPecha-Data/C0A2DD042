Prayer for the Long Life of the Third Dodrupchen, Jigme Tenpai Nyima
Oṃ svasti-siddhaṃ!
Ever-perfect manifestation of the fearless siddha’s wisdom,
'Sun of the Teachings', great burgeon of the victorious ones,
Possessing the splendour of enlightened activity that is all-pervasive—
Remain, I pray, as the best of the learned, ethical and kind-hearted.
May your vajra form-kāya remain as steadfast as the immortal protector,
Your excellent speech, triumphant over all, resound throughout existence,
And the wish-fulfilling wheel of your wisdom mind 1
Remain stable and unwavering throughout an infinite ocean of aeons!
Through perfecting the observance of discipline, study, contemplation and meditation,
And through the signs of excellence in exposition, debate and composition,
May all be auspicious for your excellent deeds as a second Guide
To the Sage’s teachings to spread throughout the threefold world.

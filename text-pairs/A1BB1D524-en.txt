Prayer for the Long Life of Riké Chatral 1
Oṃ svasti.
Deathless siddha Padmākara,
Deathless vidyādharas Thangtong Gyalpo and the rest,
Deathless adepts, too, through your truth and power,
May any obstacles to this glorious guru’s life be dispelled.
Unbreakable, having entered the protective vajra dome,
Unchanging, with the vital channel perfectly steadfast,
Undying, having gained the siddhi of longevity, and
Unshakeable—may you remain, I pray, in vajra indestructibility.
With your body as enduring as that of Tsöndrü Zangpo, 2
Your speech unceasingly proclaiming the Dharma of the whispered transmission, 3
And your mind ablaze with the powerful realization of luminosity,
May you remain, your spontaneous activity flourishing throughout the ten directions.

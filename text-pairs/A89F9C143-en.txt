The Swift Fulfilment of Wishes Prayer for the Swift Appearance of the Supreme Tulku of the Mañjughoṣa Guru
Oṃ svasti.
Embodiment of the blessings of the gurus of the three transmissions, 1
Whose qualities of knowledge, love and power are beyond imagining,
Great conveyer of the entire teachings of the victorious Buddha—
Orgyen Chökyi Gyatso, to you I pray.
Grant your blessings so that the youthful moon, exalted and sublime,
That is your emanation, holder of the white lotus garland of liberation,
May swiftly appear as my own and others’ protector
To bring immense benefit to the teachings and beings.

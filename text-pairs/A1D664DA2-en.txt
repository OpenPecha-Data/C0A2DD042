Short Maṇḍala Offering
The ground is purified with scented water and strewn with flowers.
It is adorned with Sumeru, the king of mountains, the four quarters of the universe, and the sun and the moon;
Thinking of it as the blessed buddha-fields, I offer it.
By virtue of this offering, may all beings here and now attain the happiness of that pure land!

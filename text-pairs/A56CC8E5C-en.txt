Prayer for Translators
Oṃ Svasti!
Guide for this fortunate age, crowning glory of the Śākya clan,
Khenpo Bodhisattva, Master Padmasambhava, Dharma-King Trisong Deutsen and the other two great ancestral rulers,
Beacon of the Buddhadharma, Atiśa, and the rest—
To all you peerless, most excellent of masters, we pray!
Thönmi Sambhota, the first to translate from Sanskrit into Tibetan,
And the great lotsāwas Vairotsana, Nyak Jñānakumara,
Kawa Paltsek, Chokro Lü’i Gyaltsen
And Shyang Nanam Yeshe De, to you we pray!
Rinchen Zangpo, Ngok Loden Sherab,
Dromtönpa Gyalwe Jungne and all the other powerful masters of speech,
Countless lotsāwas of earlier and later times,
Bringing to mind your kindness, we pray to you from the depths of our hearts!
In this age of the five degenerations, people like us merely feign a pure motivation.
Now, as we translate into our own regional languages
The expressing words and the meaning conveyed in the statements of the Buddha,
The teachings of the vehicles leading from the origin, Vedic asceticism and supreme and powerful transformative methods, 1
And especially those of the piṭaka of vidyādharas,
The teachings of kama , terma and pure visions,
And those related to the three roots and the dharmapālas,
May we be free from adverse circumstances and hindrances, and may all our pure aspirations be accomplished!
In keeping with the wishes of the great lotsāwas and paṇḍitas of the past,
May we bring benefit to the teachings of the Buddha and to all beings,
And may the precious Buddhadharma spread throughout the world,
Developing like the waxing moon, and bringing auspiciousness to all!

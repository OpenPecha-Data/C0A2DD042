Guru Yoga for Pacifying Spirits and Sickness of the Heart Prayer
Homage to the Lotus Guru!
Aḥ, at my crown, upon seats of lotus, sun-disc
And male and female spirits, gyalpo and senmo ,
Is my root teacher, the most excellent guru,
In the form of the all-pervasive Wrathful Padma.
He is dark red with one face and two hands,
Holding vajra and scorpion, and in wrathful attire.
At his five places are Yamāntaka, Hayagrīva,
Vajrapāṇi, Vajravārāhī, and Mebal,
Each with their own adornments and implements.
At his heart is the vidyādhara Longsal Nyingpo,
Dressed as a mantra practitioner and holding a vajra and iron scorpion.
I visualize them as awesome, majestic and resplendent,
Their three centres marked by the three vajras,
And consider that samayasattva and jñānasattva merge indivisibly.
Precious, exalted Pema Tötreng Tsal,
Radiantly ablaze with wisdom wrath,
And the inseparable Longsal Nyingpo—
In devotion, I pray to you from the depths of my heart:
Pacify hindrances and cause my wishes to be spontaneously fulfilled.
Rays of light emerge from the guru’s body
Bringing a stream of red and white nectar,
Which flows endlessly, suffusing my whole body.
It clears away all sickness of the heart,
And fills my form entirely with nectar.
Finally, the guru descends
To the dark agate tent at my heart,
In which he remains inseparably,
And I settle in the union of mind and wisdom.

Prayer to Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 1
Knower of the three times, Orgyen Tötreng Tsal,
Vimalamitra, who attained the vajra body of great transference,
And Lord Tri Songdetsen, initiator of the teachings in the Land of Snows—
All were embodied in the magical manifestation of Khyentse Wangpo.
To the lord of the maṇḍala, Chökyi Lodrö,
I pray with intense and heartfelt devotion:
Lovingly guide and care for me without ever parting,
And grant your blessings, so that my mind and your wisdom merge as one.

Extemporary Practice of Longevity for Oneself or Others
At the crown is the Bhagavan Amitayūs, white, with the saṃbhogakāya accoutrements, and with his hands in the gesture of equanimity, holding a long-life vase.
Light from his heart collects the vital essence of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, which appears concentrated in the form of white elixir that emits rays of light.
This elixir fills the long-life vase in his hands, then overflows and enters the crown of the object of focus, filling their entire body and restoring any loss of vitality in the channels, wind-energies or essences.
Longevity is thereby extended and the lustre of health restored.
The flow of elixir purifies the tainted body and transforms it into a vajra form.
Amitāyus melts into the elixir,
And dissolves into the object of focus at the crown, so that they attain immortal vajra longevity.
This will pacify hindrances and bring about an exceedingly long life.

The Wish-Granting King of Jewels: An Essential Garland of Offerings
Ho! Out of the great purity and equalness of appearance and existence,
Samantabhadra's offering clouds appear spontaneously without obstruction:
Divine substances, the seven outer offerings and stimulants of the six senses,
The seven emblems of royalty and eight auspicious substances,
Excellent vases, wish-fulfilling trees and treasuries of jewels,
Great clouds of nectar and gardens that yield produce without toil,
Supremely bountiful cows and all the sacred substances of accomplishment,
Food, drink, clothing, ornaments and other precious accoutrements,
All the offering gifts of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas and human beings,
As well as the offerings of the bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions,
All gathered together, amassing like clouds from here, there and everywhere—
These and all the infinite arrays of the three-kāya realms,
We offer to the deities of the maṇḍala:
Grant us supreme and ordinary accomplishments, we pray.
By sending out these clouds of varied offerings,
Which delight all the victorious buddhas of the past, present and future,
The captivating ladies who confer the splendour of immaculate bliss,
The hosts of auspicious goddesses who sing and dance,
Fill the whole expanse of space completely,
To bring a rain of divine substances and flowers,
Which, together with my own and others' virtues of body, speech and mind and all our possessions,
Form clouds of oceanic, inexhaustible riches.
And to the accompaniment of music and song of exaltation
Praising the vast, ocean-like qualities of greatness,
All these infinite clouds of offering that manifest
As the offering mudrā of the bliss and emptiness of appearance and existence
We offer to the deities of the maṇḍala:
Grant us supreme and ordinary accomplishments, we pray.
Like a miraculous creation of the buddhas and their heirs,
All these offerings, vast and unsurpassed,
Are the infinite, cloud-like offerings of Samantabhadra,
A wish-granting treasury, a well-spring extending throughout the whole of space and time,
Equal in extent to the dharmadhātu, the absolute expanse,
Granting the inexhaustible splendour of immaculate bliss,
Perfectly transcending all notions of subject-object duality,
A vast, wondrous gift that is spontaneously perfect.
Appearance and existence have always been utterly pure, a realm of great bliss,
And the spontaneously present riches of the victorious ones defy the imagination.
Within Samantabhadra's space of great equality,
This supreme and unsurpassed, most excellent offering
We present to the deities of the maṇḍala:
Grant us supreme and ordinary accomplishments, we pray.

Guru Yoga of the Great Learned and Accomplished Ācārya Haribhadra
Āḥ. Out of the state of emptiness, the unborn nature of all phenomena,
Upon a throne of aloe wood, lotus and lunar disc,
Appears the great Ācārya Haribhadra,
White with a tinge of red and radiant with majesty and splendour.
He wears the costume of a paṇḍita,
On his head, a hat of the three piṭakas,
His right hand in the gesture of Dharma teaching and his left in equipoise,
He holds a volume of text and sits with legs half-crossed.
At his heart is Prajñāpāramitā,
Gold in colour, with one face and four hands—
The main pair in the gestures of Dharma teaching and equipoise,
The lower pair granting refuge and holding a vajra
And holding a volume of text; she wears saṃbhogakāya dress
And is seated in vajra posture on a lotus and lunar disc.
From their three centres, marked with the three syllables,
And the A at their hearts signifying the unborn,
Light radiates out invite to the wisdom beings
Who merge inseparably with the visualized forms.
Emaho!
Paṇḍita cared for by the protector Maitreya,
You precisely clarified the intent of the Mother of the Victorious Ones,
Haribhadra whose wisdom is unlimited,
To you I pray: help me to realize the meaning of the Mother Prajñāpāramitā!
oṃ āḥ vajra guru siṃhabhadra prajñāpāramitā sarva siddhi hūṃ
From the heart-centres of the guru and great Mother
Emanate countless rays of golden light,
And vowels, consonants and A syllables falling like rain,
Which gently dissolve into my own body.
All the darkness of unknowing is dispelled
And the light of supreme intelligence expands.
At the end of the session, white, red and blue nectar
Emerges from the guru's three centres,
Accompanied by the sounds of the syllables,
And dissolves into my own three centres.
The guru melts into light and the Prajñāpāramitā volume
Becomes a sphere of light.
They dissolve into me and I take on the form of golden Prajñāpāramitā,
And in that state, appearances and mind combine.

Namo!
In the gurus, the yidam deities,
And ḍākinīs too, I take refuge.
To establish beings in the Blissful
I set my mind on supreme awakening.
Hūṃ. From the nature of emptiness and compassion

Bright red with three faces, red, blue and white.

Majestic on seats of lotus and moon and sun discs.
Their retinue appear like rays emanating from the sun.
The deity’s three centres are marked with the three syllables.
At the heart of the great indivisible samaya and wisdom forms,
Upon a sun disc is a red Hrīḥ, around which
The mantra garland turns, emitting rays of light,
Which offer to the noble ones and purify beings’ twofold obscurations.
The whole outer world and its inhabitants arise as the maṇḍala of the Guru.

oṃ āḥ hūṃ guru deva ḍākinī sarva siddhi phala hūṃ āḥ
Appearance as the deity dissolves into the space of clear light.
Then, once again, I arise in the form of the Vidyādhara.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ

Cutting through the Four Demons in Absolute Space In Praise of Machik Labdrön
Mother who bears all the victorious ones of the three times,
Manifesting in the rūpakāya form of the Perfection of Wisdom,
She who acts for the sake of all living beings—
Ama Labkyi Drönma, to you I pay homage!
In this northern country of the Land of Snows,
You tamed embodied humans and immaterial gods and demons,
Saviouress who emanated from the Great Mother’s heart—
Magnificent master of the tenth bhūmi, to you I offer praise!
From an early age, the shoots of your enlightened potential blossomed;
You bowed down at the feet of many excellent tutors,
And became an ocean-like treasury of profound and vast Dharma instruction—
Great reverend and exalted lady, to you I offer praise!
The fundamental intent of the mother Prajñāpāramitā
You realized directly through your own awareness,
And in a hundred ways you opened the great wisdom-mind treasury
Of cutting through demons, the profound union of sūtra and mantra—to you I offer praise!
The supreme nirmāṇakāya Padampa Sangye
Enhanced his realization while wandering aimlessly through various lands
And reached the pinnacle of the yogic conduct of equal taste—
To you who are fully victorious over the three worlds, I offer praise!
You who are the emanation of all the buddhas,
Your realization one with accomplished vidyādharas,
Manifestation of Vajravārāhī, sovereign of space,
Supreme yoginī, queen of siddhas—to you I offer praise!
You remain in emptiness while not forsaking sentient beings,
Your actions accord with your speech, and you convey the sugatas’ blessings,
Great founder of the instruction lineage of Cutting through demons,
With its profound fourfold intent—to you I offer praise!
The supreme illusion-like samādhi,
As well as the heroic-march and vajra-like—
You mastered the equipoise of inconceivable concentrations,
Sublime leader of wisdom ḍākinīs, to you I offer praise!
Emptiness, the absence of characteristic marks,
And wishlessness—these three gateways to liberation
You mastered with the inexhaustible wisdom of the dharmadhātu—
To you, reverend bhagavatī, I offer praise!
The substantial, insubstantial, elation and egotistical pride, 1
The aggregates, afflictions, lord of death and devaputra — 2
Having conquered these māras in absolute space, you arrived at suchness—
To you who perfected authentic abandonment and realization, I offer praise!
The instruction of the One Mother, who is so very kind,
Is like treatment directed at the vital points: it eradicates afflictions,
Uproots ego-clinging and reveals primordial wisdom directly—
To you, the heroine who swiftly liberates beings, I offer praise!
The dharmatā nature is sky-like, beyond complexity and the eight extremes,
It is a featureless expanse beyond labelling and expression,
Yet transformed into this physical expression of feminine appearance—
To you, whose essence is the great middle way beyond extremes, I offer praise!
Awareness and emptiness, the luminosity of inseparable method and wisdom—
You transcended the phenomena of transient, passion-based bliss,
And abandoned obscurations that derive from dualistic conception—
To you who are established in clear light Mahāmudrā, I offer praise!
In the space of the primordial purity of all phenomena in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa
Emerges the radiance that is self-arising and spontaneously present;
Through this, you reached the pinnacle of wisdom that is unconditioned—
To you, originally perfect awareness matured in physical form, I offer praise!
Vajrayoginī of co-emergent wisdom—
From the vajra queen’s sky-like expanse of bliss-emptiness,
You emanate and reabsorb the victorious buddhas and their heirs—
To you, the sovereign of infinite, ocean-like maṇḍalas, I offer praise!
Through the power of praising and praying to you in this way,
May all that prevents our attainment of awakening—
Outer, inner and secret enemies—be eliminated in basic space,
And, traversing the three defiles, may we accomplish yogic conduct!
May we guide beings through loving kindness and compassion,
Be unhindered as we carry out the four kinds of activity,
Perfect the strength of the great dharmakāya mother’s realization,
And become inseparable from you, Labkyi Drönma!
May the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha flourish and spread,
May the lives of the holders of the teachings long remain secure,
May the saṅgha increase and all regions of the world be happy,
And may those who hold wrong or barbaric views be overcome!
May we cut through ego-clinging, the root of saṃsāric existence,
Abide in the realization of Phaṭ—means and wisdom inseparable—
Continuously throughout the three times, within our own awareness,
And, by liberating the triple world in basic space, empty saṃsāra from its depths!

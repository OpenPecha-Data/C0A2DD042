The Sweet-Sounding Song that Fulfils All Aims A Prayer to Noble Tārā Combined with Her Root Mantra
oṃ tāre tuttāre ture svāhā
With Oṃ the jewel of liberation and all that could be wished for is bestowed.
With the excellence of splendour, prosperity and the like,
You bring healing to existence and peace, mistress of the three secrets,
Noble Mother of perfect generosity, to you I pay homage!
With Tāre , the precious vessel of bodhicitta,
You constantly liberate living beings, who are in number as extensive as space,
From the ocean of suffering in cyclic existence and the lower realms.
Noble Mother Tārā, to you I pay homage!
With Tuttāre , the ambrosia of blessings
Banishes the tormenting heat of fear and misery,
And causes the lotus of benefit and wellbeing to bloom.
To you Mother, who protects from distress, I pay homage!
Turé —the instant I remember you, Venerable One,
With your display of attributes and forms to tame beings as appropriate,
You protect against all the misfortunes of belief in a self.
I pay homage to you, compassionate and swift Mother.
Svāhā —bountiful clouds of enlightened activity
Rain down jewels of virtue and goodness
That bring relief to all beings of the three realms.
I pay homage to you, Mother, Wish-Fulfilling Wheel.
In brief, to you, the embodiment of the primordial wisdom of
All the victorious ones and their spiritual heirs,
Noble lady, I pray with heartfelt devotion,
Take care of me until enlightenment.
Pacify all circumstances that prevent the accomplishment of the sacred Dharma.
And grant your blessings, so that with long life, merit, splendour, knowledge, love,
All favourable conditions in abundance,
I may accomplish the twofold benefit―for myself and others.

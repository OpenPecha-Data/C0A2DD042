The Prayer for the Wrathful Guru Takhyung Barwa from the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse
To the Conqueror Samantabhadra, the supreme teacher Vajrasattva,
Prahevajra, 1 noble Śrī Siṃha,
Mañjuśrīmitra, and Jñānasūtra,
I pray – bestow blessings and empowerments!
To Vimalamitra, Padmasambhava, the heart-disciples – king, subjects, and companion –
Longchen Rabjam, the omniscient Jigme Lingpa,
And my root guru, the embodiment of all refuges,
I pray – guide me on the path that brings liberation!
To Orgyen Dorje Chang, the embodiment of all the conquerors,
Who takes the form of the wild wrathful conqueror for all those opponents difficult to tame,
And all the deities arisen in the maṇḍala of the wrathful guru Takhyung,
I pray – bestow the fruition of liberation!
Without discerning one's own essence, the karmic energy of dualistic grasping
Produces various conditions for the proliferation of various objects.
May dualistic grasping be self-liberated in great equanimity,
And may I then obtain the supreme state of the spontaneously accomplished vidyādhara!

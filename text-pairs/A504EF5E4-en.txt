Prayer for the Spread of the Tradition of Sera Khandro 1
May the tradition of the accomplished vidyādharī and universal sovereign of the ḍākinīs,
The holder of the ḍākinīs' secret treasury of profound, unprecedented instructions,
The celestial queen Dewé Dorje,
Spread everywhere, throughout the far reaches of this world, and endure throughout the whole of time.

A Vajrakīla Lineage Prayer
Unaltered and beyond conceptual elaboration, the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra,
Spontaneously perfect, illusory manifestation, the “Sixth” Buddha Vajradhāra,
And, inseparable from them, the all-embodying Vajrasattva, Lord of Secrets and the rest—
Gurus of the lineage, to you we pray!
Pema Tötreng Tsal, fully empowered with awareness-creativity,
Yeshe Tsogyal, Blissful Lady of Secrets,
Dorje Dudjom, empowered to practise wrathful action, and the rest—
Vidyādharas of the kīla, to you we pray!
Glorious lama, embodiment of all the gurus, devas and ḍākinīs,
And deities of Vajrakīla, magical expressions of compassion,
Together with the kīla guardians, who weigh right and wrong, and all the treasure keepers—
To all you glorious deities of the maṇḍala, we pray!
On the basis of our bodhicitta commitment to unsurpassable awakening,
We cultivate the supreme wisdom of the great bliss of union—
Inspire us, yogis and holders of the lineage of the Great and Glorious One,
With your blessings: grant us empowerment, strength and capacity!
With the wisdom kīla , let us liberate self-clinging into all-pervading space!
With the kīla of great bliss, let us overcome habitual patterns in subtle energy and mind!
With the kīla of skilful means, let us transform all existence into the vajra!
With the kīla of activity, let us steal the life-force of all who harm the teachings!
In this way, may we gain the most supreme and wondrous of accomplishments,
In their entirety and at this very instant!
And, always inseparable from the great and glorious Heruka,
May we carry out the activity of spontaneously emptying saṃsāra from its very depths!

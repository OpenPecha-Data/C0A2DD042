Prayer for the Long Life of the Glorious Sakyapa Father and Son
Born as a son of the Khön family in the divine lineage of the Lord of Speech,
Protector who spreads the teachings of Kunga in a hundred directions, 1
Mighty master of supreme accomplishment, peerless in merit,
May your life be secure and your activity flourish and spread! 2
Mañjughoṣa, the sun of wisdom that shines its myriad rays,
You are the crown jewel that delights all beings, including the gods,
A powerful king with the force and strength of intelligence,
A vajra that destroys the hordes of māras—may your life be secure! 3

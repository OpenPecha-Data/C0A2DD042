Prayer for the Long Life of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti.
The wisdom of great bliss, which is beyond transference,
Arises fully as an enchanting form of indestructible vajra youth—
Tārā, noble Wish-Fulfilling Wheel,
Shower down great blessings of everlasting immortality, here and now!
The wondrous aspiration of the glorious Karmapa, Lord of the World,
Is like a verdant valley, a forest of meditative concentration,
Beautified by this wish-granting tree that benefits others—
Incomparable scion of the buddhas, may your life remain secure.
The lotus garden of the Dharma of transmission and realization, sūtra and mantra,
Flourishes through the brilliant light of teaching and practice—
Great sun of the supreme secret and definitive meaning,
To banish the darkness of wrong views, may your life remain secure.
The stream of your activity, leading all whom you encounter onto the path of liberation,
Is forever unceasing and pervades throughout the entire earth.
As a noble defender of the teachings and of beings,
Without partiality or bias, may your life remain secure.
May the life of this supreme guide remain secure for a hundred aeons,
May the Dharma melody of the definitive meaning resound unto the very limits of the world,
May the tradition of the practice lineage ripen like crops in autumn,
And may all be auspicious for the blossoming of a perfect age of virtue and goodness.

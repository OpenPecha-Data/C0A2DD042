Guru Yoga Focusing upon Noble Kurukullā
From this moment on, until I achieve the essence of awakening,
I shall take refuge at the feet of the foremost exalted Lady, and,
So as to liberate infinite brings drowning in the ocean of suffering,
Will generate the supreme mind of bodhicitta.
I sit at the centre of a fantastic, emanated palace
That lies within a vast display of pure buddha realms.
Upon my head, seated on a lotus flower with a thousand petals,
Is the epitome of the Three Jewels, the noblest Kurukullā.
Clear red, she is dressed in divine clothes and jewellery.
She shows the mudrā of fearlessness and holds an arrow, bow and utpala flower. 1
She abides, seated in the vajrāsana within a blaze of wisdom light,
As the very embodiment of all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Kye-ma! Noble Kurukullā,
Mother of all buddhas,
You are the illusory wisdom kāya,
Sole refuge and protector of all,
And special provider for all those
Who are impoverished by craving.
Don’t forget your past vow!
Look upon us, the poor and destitute,
With your eyes of wisdom.
Lend us a loving hand,
Quickly grant your blessings,
And bestow the accomplishment and empowerment of great bliss!
Guru, Noble Kurukullā, know me!
oṃ kurukulle hrīḥ hūṃ svāhā
The noble lady is delighted, melts into light
And, dissolving through the crown of my head, comes to rest within the very depths of my heart.
My entire body fills with the red nectar of great bliss
And the guru’s wisdom and my mind become one within the natural state. Ah.

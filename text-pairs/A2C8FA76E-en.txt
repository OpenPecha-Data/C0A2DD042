Daily Lungta Recitation
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Assembly of the Three Jewels, Three Roots, gods and sages,
Lords of the three families and the goddess Vijayā,
Padma Tötreng Tsal and all the vidyādharas of India and Tibet,
Glorious Gaṇapati, warrior spirits and armies of gods,
Lord of the personal deities, great being Gesar,
And deities in the line of interdependent existence—
I present to you Samantabhadra’s offering clouds of real and imagined gifts,
With compassion, please grant your blessings, I pray!
Pacify all circumstances that impair and diminish our lungta :
Black magic, evil sorcery, harmful influences, hindrances and obstacles!
And pacify all forms of obstruction and disharmony:
Conflict, hostility, malicious gossip, rivalry, legal disputes, recurrent calamity, and the like.
Greatly enhance the power and strength of the meritorious windhorse
Complete with its four miraculous limbs!
And grant us all the attainments—spiritual and temporal,
Supreme and ordinary—just as we desire!

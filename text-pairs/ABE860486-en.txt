Guru Padmasambhava, Master of the Land of Snows
Emaho!
Guru Padmasambhava, master of the Land of Snows,
Infinite peaceful and wrathful deities of the Three Roots,
And unfailing guardians of refuge, the Three Jewels—
From the very core of my heart, I pray to you all.
The pure aggregates and elements of your body are the deity’s illusory form,
The pure wind-element of your speech is by nature the mantra,
And the pure cognizance of your mind is the maṇḍala of dharmakāya,
Glorious and incomparable Jalü Dorje, watch over me!
Imprisoned in conditioned existence by past actions and afflictions,
And buffeted by karma and the vicissitudes of joy and sorrow,
I lack the autonomy to proceed wherever I choose,
And I have no other source of protection but you.
As I place my sincere and trusting faith in you,
Do not allow me to succumb to misdeeds or delusion.
O protector, never forsake me in your compassion
And help me to escape from this misery! Kyé! Kyé!
As I travel the five long and perilous pathways of being,
Tormented throughout this life, the next, and the bardos,
I have no one else to rely on for refuge and protection.
Free me from the terrors of saṃsāra and its lower realms!
To the supreme pure realm of Sukhāvatī, wherein
Lord Orgyen Padma and Amitābha are inseparable,
The glorious and gracious root guru’s wisdom expanse—
To this, the dharma-sphere of my own awareness, transfer me!

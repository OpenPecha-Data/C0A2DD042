Drumbeat of the Deathless Vajra A Fervent Invocation and Prayer
Gracious, supreme guardian of mine,
Embodiment of the three roots, deathless Padmasambhava,
As I, your devoted disciple, approach you, knowing you to be the all-sufficient refuge,
Nurture me, never leaving, with unbiased compassion!
Pacify all obstacles and faults, such as untimely death!
Fulfil all my wishes, such as living long!
Bless me that, perfecting the intentions and actions that aid the teachings and beings,
I may be able to fulfil your awakened intent!
Longevity’s ultimate sovereign is self-awareness, Padmasambhava,
With hrīḥ , the very life-force of vajra-wisdom essence,
Naturally, primordially present within his heart centre
In an orb of sun and moon, permanent, stable, and unchanging—how amazing this is!

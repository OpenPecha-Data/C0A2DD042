Prayer to Ngawang Samten Lodrö 1
Oṃ svasti.
Yogin of wrathful Mañjuśrī, the lord of speech,
Treasury of profound meditation, absorption and intelligence,
Preeminent holder of the whispered lineage of Losal Gyatso,
Tenpai Gyaltsen, 'Victory Banner of the Teachings', at your feet I pray. 2
May the blessings of your splendid and excellent three secrets,
Which spontaneously accomplish the twofold aim, infuse my mind,
And may the precious teachings of the profound Whispered Lineage,
Valid in the four ways, 3 flourish and spread far and wide!

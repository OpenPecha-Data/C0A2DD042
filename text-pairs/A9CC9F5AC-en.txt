Prayer for Swift Rebirth of Dodrupchen Rinpoche
Emanation of Sangye Lingpa, the universal sovereign of the profound treasures
Of the deathless vidyādhara Padmasambhava,
Vital axis of the teachings of the kama and terma, Lord Dodrupchen,
Tupten Trinlé Pal—'Glorious Enlightened Action for the Sage’s Teachings'—to you I pray.
Although the pure kāya, the indestructible essence, is all-pervasive,
Clear light, naturally arising, the actual nature of great bliss,
And is beyond the conceptual characteristics of departing and returning,
Still, I pray you may return in an illusory rūpakāya with all the signs and marks of perfection.
From the qualities of scriptural learning and realization, like the maṇḍalas of sun and moon,
Your teaching and practice illuminate the Buddha’s teaching throughout the four continents,
Magnificent and incomparable protector of the teachings and beings,
Glorious guru, may your emanation swiftly reappear!
In the Great Perfection’s clear light of awareness and emptiness,
The four visions, the most secret essence of the paths,
Manifest the fourfold results of spontaneous presence:
Peerless holder of these teachings, may your emanation swiftly reappear!
Resplendent amidst the constellation of the glorious Three Supreme Ones,
Through the power of a hundred thousand positive deeds, tainted and untainted,
May we swiftly have the good fortune to encounter
The moon-like face of this incomparable guru’s emanation!

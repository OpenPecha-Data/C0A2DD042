Inlaid Jewels: Addenda to the 'Neck-Pouch Dagger’ (Purba Gulkhukma) Cycle The Stages of Conclusion
Hūṃ. In the enlightened state of even and unmoving equality,
There is no room for ordinary concepts or negative thoughts.
Thus, transcending all ordinary patterns of dualistic grasping,
May you perfectly enjoy this offering of great equality.
mahāpūjaho
For the utterly malevolent and hostile,
Peaceful means are of no benefit,
And tathāgatas appear in wrathful form—
To the producer of vajra emanations, I offer praise.
Hūṃ. Vidyādharas of Vajrakumāra:
Cause us to actualize the Vajra of existence!
Deities of the existential Vajrakīla:
Cause us to actualize the wisdom wrath!
Oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya sarva siddhi phala hūṃ
The appearance of the deity does not dissolve, but without grasping,
Simply relaxes within the experience of dharmatā equality.
The play of thoughts and the perceptions of the six senses
Arises as the adornment of the wisdom of awareness and emptiness.
Ah, ah, ah.
As symbolized by this virtue, may all the positive deeds of the three times
Fully ripen in the minds of all beings who extend throughout the whole of space,
And, inseparable from the principal deity of the buddha family,
May they all actualize the maṇḍala of spontaneous appearance!
Ho! Within the experience of the unique enlightened activity of the perfect great and glorious,
The malicious spirits of the three worlds are tamed through compassionate means,
The inconceivable miraculous activity of taming by whatever is necessary—
May the accomplished conqueror Vajrakumāra grant auspiciousness!

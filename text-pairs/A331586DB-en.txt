Töpa Gyatsoma Offering Prayer
There are waters of oceanic learning that gather and swirl,
Flowers of virtue and clouds of the incense of ethical conduct,
There are lamps of wisdom and a lake that is perfumed with faith.
There is the sublime sustenance of samādhi’s elixir,
And music that resounds in melodious songs of praise.
There are parasols of benevolence, pennants of discernment,
And victory banners raised aloft in courageous eloquence.
This celestial mansion of my body, so beautifully adorned
I offer to the Lord of Dharma who resides forever
On the full moon and blossoming lotus of my heart.
With a mind of certain aspiration, I pray to you:
Master to all beings, may you always be pleased!

A Brief Mañjuśrī Sādhana
In the Buddha, the Dharma and the Supreme Assembly
I take refuge until I attain enlightenment.
Through the merit of practising generosity and so on,
May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of all beings.
May all sentient beings enjoy happiness and the causes of happiness!
May they be free from suffering and the causes of suffering!
May they never be separated from the sacred happiness devoid of suffering!
And may they dwell in boundless equanimity that is free from attachment and aversion!
oṃ svabhāva śuddhāḥ sarvadharmāḥ svabhāva śuddho ‘haṃ
Out of the state of emptiness, upon a lotus and moon disk
Appears my own mind as dhīḥ , from which Mañjughoṣa arises,
Orange in colour, with two hands holding a sword and volume of text.
He wears jewel ornaments and silken garments and is seated in the vajra posture.
At his heart, upon a moon disk, is dhīḥ surrounded by the mantra garland,
From which light radiates, clearing obscurations and expanding wisdom’s radiance.
oṃ arapacana dhīḥ
With all of your kindness and love, let your wisdom’s shining light
Clear the darkness of my ignorance, once and for all.
Grant me, I pray, the intelligence, the brilliance
To understand the scriptures—both the Word and the treatises.

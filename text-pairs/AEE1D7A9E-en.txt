The Jewelled Rosary An Aspiration Toward Longed-for Aims
All the gurus, including glorious Virūpa,
The great benevolent one, 1 Sonam Tsemo,
Drakpa Gyaltsen, Sakya Paṇḍita,
Lodrö Gyaltsen, Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo,
Losal Gyatso, Khyentse Wangchuk,
Jamyang Khyentse, Loter Wangpo and the rest,
All you gurus of the lineage of Lamdré teachings,
Together with Hevajra and the eight goddesses,
Mighty lord Mahākāla, consort and retinue, and others,
Turn your wise attention towards me, and
Be a witness to the swift fulfilment of these points of aspiration. Kyé!
As I have fallen under the power of carelessness,
My dharmic practice has been beset by adversity,
And my turbulent, mistaken thoughts in particular
Have prevented my character from becoming workable,
Henceforth, therefore, may I strive to tame my mind.
May I avoid companions and places that inflame emotion,
Ignore the beckoning demons of the sensory pleasures,
And remain content with dharma-practicing friends
And modest food, clothing and other necessities.
Meaningless chatter triggers attachment and aversion.
Having put a stop to speech that is by nature harmful,
Aside from brief messages with purely dharmic content,
May I strive to maintain only continuous recitation.
May I never be without renunciation, bodhicitta,
And the genuine view, uphold perfect ethics,
Delight the guru out of faith and devotion,
And transform all that I do into bodhisattva conduct.
May I guard the common and uncommon vows as I would my own life-force,
And through the power of exerting myself in the path of the two stages in four sessions,
With the knowledge that my guru is the chief deity of the maṇḍala,
May I swiftly attain the level of the wondrous four kāyas!
Through repeated practice of the way of the four empowerments,
The profound heart of the path, may I create the auspicious conditions for the four kāyas,
And having actualized the maṇḍala of the vajra body,
May I dance as Hevajra throughout the three worlds!

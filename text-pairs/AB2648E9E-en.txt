Prayer for the Long Life of Dilgo Khyentsé II of Shechen, Urgyen Tenzin Jigme Lhundrup
Oṃ svasti! Through the compassion of the infinite buddhas and bodhisattvas,
And the blessing of wondrous gurus, devas, and ḍākinīs,
The beloved master Khyentsé, treasure of knowledge and love,
Has manifested his matchless compassion, just as all have wished:
Fearless Holder of the teachings of the Lord of Orgyen
And of the non-partisan tradition of sūtras and tantras,
All-victorious one, let your life be forever firm and indestructible;
And accomplish, spontaneously and without effort, your vision—of present happiness and ultimate bliss!

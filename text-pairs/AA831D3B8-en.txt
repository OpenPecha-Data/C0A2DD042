The Eight-Branch Offering
I prostrate to the vajra master,
Glorious embodiment of the buddhas of past, present and future!
With a mind free from all duality,
I take refuge in the Three Jewels, the objects of reliance!
I request that you accept these pure offerings,
Both actual and envisioned.
My faults, the hindrances that cut the flow of siddhis,
I confess without exception.
In all those actions throughout the ten directions, done without attachment,
And free from concepts of subject, object and action, I rejoice!
I awaken the perfect bodhicitta,
Pure, untainted by the four extremes. 1
To the sugatas, mighty lords and sentient beings 2
I offer my body for the threefold purpose. 3
Gathering the merits accumulated throughout all my lives,
I dedicate them to supreme enlightenment!

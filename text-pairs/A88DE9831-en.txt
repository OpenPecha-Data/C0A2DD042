Prayer to Buddha Amitābha 1
O dharmakāya Amitābha, embodiment of all the buddhas,
And protector Avalokiteśvara, manifestation of compassion,
To these ultimate and supreme sources of refuge, I pray!
May I and all beings, my previous mothers, as infinite as space,
Face no unfavourable conditions, only ever-increasing positivity.
May we be free from misdeeds and have the eight qualities and ten virtues;
And, in our future lives, may we travel to the pure realm of Great Bliss!
Bless us, so that having attained buddhahood in that physical form,
We may become a guide who leads beings from extremes,
And gain strength and power just like yours.
oṃ amitābha hrīḥ

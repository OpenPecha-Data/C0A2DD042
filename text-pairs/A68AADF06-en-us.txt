The Noble Dhāraṇī Essence of Immeasurable Longevity and Wisdo
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was seated at the bank of a pool by the Ganges river with a great monastic saṅgha of five hundred monks and a great saṅgha of bodhisattvas
The Blessed One addressed the monks
the monks gave the Blessed One their full attention, and the Blessed One said to them
“A perfect buddha, Lives to the west of here In the realm of Sukhāvatī
The Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus, “Those who recite his nam
Will be reborn there
At the moment of death they will see The teacher with his monastic saṅgha
“There are no women there
And no gestation in a womb
Beings with great magical power Are born there from lotuses made of jewels
“As soon as one thinks about Food, clothing, medicines, Robes, bedding, and alms bowls They instantly appear
“The buddhas dwelling in all ten directions Sing the praises of Sukhāvatī
Since the Buddha is inconceivable
The Buddha’s Dharma is inconceivable
“And the Noble Saṅgha is inconceivable too
When one has generated faith in the inconceivable
The ripened result is inconceivable
One is reborn in a pure realm
“Monks, the Thus-Gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Aparimitāyus’ palace, called Having a Retinue, is ten thousand leagues wide
He was born into a kṣatriya family
Monks, the Thus-Gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Aparimitāyus’ father was a universal ruler named Most Gracious, an
his mother was named Splendorous
His kṣatriya queen was named Gracious Protector
Monks, the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus’ son was named Moonlight, an
his attendant’s name was Stainless Renown
Monks, the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus’ disciple foremost in insight was called Pinnacle of Grace, an
his disciple foremost in miraculous powers and foremost in great endeavor was named Great Array
“Monks, the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus’ Māra was called King of Offerings, an
the name of his Devadatta was Gracious Gift
Monks, the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus’ great gathering of hearers contains sixty thousand great hearers
“Monks, all the beings who think well of hi
should bear in mind the name of the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus, practice for ten days with an undistracted mind that recollects the Buddha, and continually think of the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus who dwells in the realm of Sukhāvatī
“They should also continually recite the dhāraṇī of Śrī Amṛta­dundubhi­svara­rāja
If all beings, three times a day and three times a night, prostrate with the five points of the body to the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus while thinking of him
after ten days they will have a vision of the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus an
[after ten days] they will have [a vision of the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus and] a vision of all the blessed buddhas dwelling in the ten directions
If they dedicate all their roots of virtue to rebirth in the realm of Sukhāvatī
when they die the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus will be present before them, an
they will be reborn in the buddha field of the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus
“Monks, this is the dhāraṇī called Amṛta­dundubhi­svara­rāja

“Monks, faithful sons or daughters of good family who recite this Amṛta­dundubhi­svara­rāja dhāraṇī as it has been taught should dress in clean clothes and
in a place that is pure and unspoiled, make offerings of flowers and perfumes to the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus
They should imagine the lotus seat at the seat of awakening and the perfect Bodhi tree
They should arouse longing to be there, an
if they have such longing and faith they will be reborn in the buddha field of the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus
“Monks, the Thus-Gone Aparimitāyus’ king of trees is the tree called Radiating Jeweled Lotus, and it is covered in flowers and fruit

The bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara is to his right
the bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta is to his left, an
they are all surrounded by an incalculable gathering of bodhisattvas
Faithful sons or daughters of good family who have great devotion, faith, and reverence will be reborn there
They will take miraculous birth on great lotuses made of the seven precious jewels situated on the great golden ground

except for those that arise due to the ripening of previous actions.
When the Blessed One had spoken these words
the monks, the entire retinue, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said

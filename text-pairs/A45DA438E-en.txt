Prayer to the Lineage of the Great Chetsün’s Profound Essence of Vimala
Primordial protector Samantabhadra, omnipresent lord of existence and peace,
Vajrasattva, naturally arisen awareness matured into an enlightened form,
And Garab Dorje, teacher of the sublime vehicle that involves no effort—
To you I pray: inspire me with the blessings of your enlightened intent!
Noble Mañjuśrīmitra, holder of the treasury of Ati teachings,
Śrī Siṃha, who received the empowerment of rigpa’s dynamic strength,
And Vimalamitra, who arose in a vajra body of great transference—
To you I pray: inspire me with the blessings of your enlightened intent!
Chetsün Sengé Wangchuk, who was guided by Vimala,
Completed the path of no-more-learning and obtained a kāya of luminosity,
And the ḍākinī Palgyi Lodröma, keeper of secrets—
To you I pray: inspire me with the blessings of your enlightened intent!
Magical emanation of the wisdom of Vima and his heir,
All-pervasive lord Ösel Trulpé Dorje, 1
And Vairotsana in person, Tennyi Yungdrung Lingpa— 2
To you I pray: inspire me with the blessings of your enlightened intent!
Natsok Rangdrol, 3 Padma Vijaya, 4
Lord of the maṇḍala circle, noble Chökyi Lodrö,
And the maṇḍala of infinite victorious ones, the Three Roots—
To you I pray: inspire me with the blessings of your enlightened intent!
May the stages of empowerment perfectly mature and liberate me all at once,
May mind-training practice free me from the bonds of existence and quiescence,
May obscurations be purified, accumulations perfected, and devotion reach full measure,
And may the guru’s blessings infuse my mindstream.
May I eradicate the basis of delusion in my three doors of body, speech and mind,
May I actualise the primordial purity, which is self-appearing and without bias,
And having reached the exhaustion of the four visions of spontaneous perfection,
May I awaken in the sphere of the youthful vase body.
With defilements naturally dissipated, elements naturally disappeared,
And consciousness naturally liberated, in an unobstructed body of light,
May I become the equal of Sengé Wangchuk himself,
And through the four modes of liberation empty saṃsāra from its depths.

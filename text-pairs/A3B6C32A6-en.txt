Brief Petitionary Offering to the Five Achi Sisters
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
From the offering torma emanate billowing clouds of wisdom nectar and oceanic sensory delights.
Kye! Although you do not move from the natural dharmadhātu,
To protect the Buddhist teachings and bestow supreme siddhi,
You appear as the magical web of the five mothers, queens of space—
Five Achi Sisters, come now, together with your retinues.
Accept these clouds of offerings, outer, inner, secret and unsurpassed,
As well as this torma of the nectar of primordial wisdom,
And, according to your pledge and the root and lineage gurus’ command,
Guard the Buddha’s teachings and extend the lives of its holders.
Cause the influence of Dharma benefactors to increase in all directions,
Banish disease, famine, war, and dangers caused by the four elements,
Increase auspicious signs of benefit and happiness for the whole world and its inhabitants,
And carry out the four types of activity just as we desire.

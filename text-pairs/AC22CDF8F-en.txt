To you, the five pioneers of the kama and terma, we pray!
Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, who is Vajradhara in person,
Sönam Tsemo and Drakpa Gyaltsen,
Sakya Paṇḍita and Chögyal Phakpa.
To you, the five founders of the Sakya order, we pray!
Marpa Lodrö, who is one with Hevajra,
Great Milarepa, peerless Gampopa,
Karmapa Düsum Khyenpa and Sönam Drakpa, protector of beings:
To you, the five founders of the Kagyü tradition, we pray!
Glorious Atisha, the same as Buddha Amitābha,

To you five, the emanation of Mañjuśrī and his heirs, we pray!
Through the blessing of our reciting this prayer,
May we and all others enjoy a long life, without illness, and may our lives be meaningful and one with the Dharma!
By following these supreme spiritual guides, masters of all traditions,
May we quickly attain the perfect state of enlightenment!
May those noble ones who uphold the non-partisan teaching of Buddha
Live for hundreds of aeons, and may their activities increase in all directions!
May the Saṅgha increase and may the study and practice of Buddha's teaching spread and grow!
May the whole universe and its three worlds be flooded with the sun-light of auspiciousness!

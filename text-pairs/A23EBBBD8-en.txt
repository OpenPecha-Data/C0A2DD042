Raising the Windhorse
Kyé! The universe and its inhabitants, the expanse of the five elements,
Are the five mothers: from the space of their wisdom mind
All you deities of the windhorse, throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Come, approach! I offer the flag of the windhorse:
Increase our renown, rouse our windhorse, and
With your enlightened activity make us victorious over all!

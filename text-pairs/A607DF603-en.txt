Prayer to Karma Palden Khyentse
Oṃ svasti!
Actual embodiment of all the victorious ones of the three times,
Omnipresent lord of all buddha families, nirmāṇakāya Mañjunātha,
Karma Palden Khyentse Özer,
I pray to you from the depth of my heart: inspire me with your blessings!
Cause renunciation and bodhicitta to arise in my stream of being,
And through transmitting the great blessing of your wisdom intent,
Cause the realization of Mahāmudrā, my own genuine awareness,
To arise authentically, just as it is, within my mind!
In this life, the next, and all the phases of the intermediate state,
May I be guided and cared for by you, Gentle Lord and Wish-Fulfilling Gem,
And having become inseparable from your secret body, speech and mind,
May the twofold benefit of myself and others be spontaneously accomplished!

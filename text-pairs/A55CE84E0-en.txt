Prayer to Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo 1
The wisdom you acquired at birth is as vast as space itself,
And you perfected the qualities of the threefold training.
You who introduce all with whom you’re connected to bodhisattva activity,
Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo,
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings.

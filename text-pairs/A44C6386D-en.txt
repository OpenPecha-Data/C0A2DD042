Long Life Prayer for Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
Holder of secret, vidyā , and dhāraṇī mantras,
Thubten Nyima, incarnation of ‘the master in the white shawl’ 1 ,
Sun of the Buddha’s Teaching, with your thousands of brilliant rays,
Always keep rising in the sky of our minds, that have the three kinds of faith,
Inspiring us to care for suffering beings everywhere with compassion,
And to make offerings to the Three Jewels in devotion,
So that the shining flowers of benefit and happiness burst into full bloom,
And ultimately, we attain the body of non-dual wisdom.

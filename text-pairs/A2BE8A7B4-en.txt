Brief Offering Prayer to Durtrö Lhamo, Mistress of the Charnel Ground
Bhyo! Mistress of the charnel ground, yakṣiṇī, mother Ngen Nema,
Your eight brothers and sisters, and all your retinues,
With this ocean-like cloud of offerings so pleasing to you,
With all your wishes fulfilled, keep watch over our property and prosperity!

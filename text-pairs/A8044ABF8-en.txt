An Aspiration Prayer
Homage to the Guru and Three Jewels!
May I, in each and every one of my lives to come,
Gain a precious human form, free and well-favoured,
And thereafter may I encounter sublime spiritual guides
And continuously apply myself to the sacred Dharma.
May I never cling to the pleasures of ordinary existence,
Nor become attached to the extreme of an inferior nirvāṇa.
Instead, for the sake of all beings as numerous as space is vast,
May I strive to accomplish unsurpassed awakening.
Having realized the ultimate beyond conceptual limitations
And the illusory nature of the relative,
May I never be distracted even for so much as an instant
As I diligently strive to take this profound truth to heart.
Even in this very life, may I reject all that is unwholesome
And constantly strive to apply the virtuous Dharma.
May all my actions of body, speech and mind
Always be devoted solely to others' wellbeing!
When it's time to let go of this life,
May the force of my faith and aspiration
Carry me to the western paradise of Sukhāvatī,
There to be guided by Amitābha in his compassion.

The Sunlight of Blessings: A Prayer
Embodiment of all the victorious buddhas of past, present and future,
Supreme guide leading all wandering beings,
Heruka presiding over the assembly of ḍākas and ḍākinīs ,
To you, Wish-fulfilling Jewel, I offer heartfelt homage!
I have no greater teacher than you!
I have no practice other than your advice!
At all times, I rely on you as my only hope,
Calling out to you as my wish-fulfilling jewel: may you be just that!
My mental powers are weak and my training slight,
I have little capacity for renunciation or extensive study,
But I visualize you, supreme guru, inseparable from the ever-youthful Mañjuśrī,
On the crown of my head or in the centre of my heart.
And, with devotion, pray to you sincerely:
Inspire me so that my share of blessings and compassion is not meagre,
My mindstream is ripened through empowerment and liberated through instruction,
And I reach the conclusion of the four visions!
In this and all my future lives, may I never be separated from you,
And, by mastering the treasury of vast, ocean-like samādhis and qualities,
May I remain for as long as space exists, just like Mañjughoṣa,
To strive for the benefit of all living beings!

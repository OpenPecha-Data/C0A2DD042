A Prayer to Orgyen Dorje Chang 1
Namo guru!
Orgyen Dorje Chang, embodiment of all Three Roots,
Together with Yeshe Tsogyal, foremost of ḍākinīs,
Lord and subjects, 2 treasure-revealers, oceanic adepts, and the rest—
Vidyādhara gurus of the three lineages, to you I pray:
Inspire me to remember death and impermanence!
Inspire me to develop the wish to escape samsaric existence!
Inspire me to perfect the supreme mind of awakening!
Inspire me so that all appearances dawn as the guru!
Inspire me to realize the natural state of primordial purity!
Inspire me to capture the stronghold of pure awareness!
Inspire me to reach the culmination of the four visions!
Inspire me to attain the five spontaneously perfect kāyas!

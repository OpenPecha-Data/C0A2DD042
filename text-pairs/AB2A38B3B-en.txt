Short Sang Offering to Kurukullā
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
I offer plumes of fragrant incense smoke, the nectar of wisdom,
Containing all that could be desired, like Samantabhadra’s offering clouds,
To the majestic Kurukullā and her retinue of hundreds of thousands of seductive ḍākinīs—
This I offer! May it cleanse and purify! Bestow the ability to magnetize, I pray!

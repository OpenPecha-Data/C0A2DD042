Prayer for the Long Life of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti. May the oceanic victorious ones, the Three Jewels and Three Roots
Grant their blessings so that this great sun of the Kagyü and Nyingma Dharma teachings
May remain with his three secrets (of body, speech and mind) forever secure and firm,
And so that all his wishes for the teachings and beings may be entirely fulfilled!

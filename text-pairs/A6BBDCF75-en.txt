Aspiration to Be Cared for in Every Lifetime
All the victorious buddhas of past, present and future
Appear to us in the form of the supreme spiritual guide,
Unmatched in kindness, a treasury of oceanic qualitiesâ€”
Wish-fulfilling jewel, to you I pray!
As you manifest all manner of activity,
Employing various skilful means to tame beings,
Bless me so that I do not develop wrong views even for an instant
And perceive all that you do as perfect!
Of the excellent advice that you have lovingly imparted
I shall not disobey even so much as a single word;
Just like the contents of one vase poured into another,
Let all your blessings be transferred into me!
O Protector, as you display various enlightened forms
In pure and impure realms of existence,
May I be born as your foremost attendant,
So that we may act together to bring about awakening!
Precious lord, when you display the act of enlightenment
In a sublime, self-appearing pure realm,
May I take my place among the first of your disciples,
And act supremely to further your enlightened deeds!
In short, from now onwards throughout all my future lives,
May I never be apart from you, my one true refuge,
And even once I attain enlightenment, may you be the lord of my family,
As we empty the realms of ordinary beings from their depths!

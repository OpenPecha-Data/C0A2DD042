Aspiration for the Spread of the Teachings
Oṃ svasti.
Master of the oceanic teachings of the Ancient Translations, kama and terma ,
Orgyen Chokgyur Dechen Shikpo Lingpa,
Sovereign of all the teachings, Khyentse Wangpo,
And pioneer of the Five Treasuries, Lodrö Thayé—
May your tradition never fade but grow further and further.
May this supreme, unchanging support for the three turnings of the Dharma Wheel, 1
This sanctuary where the teachings remain without ever fading,
Be filled with disciplined members of the saṅgha community,
And may the teachings of scripture and realization flourish and endure.
May everyone exert themselves continuously in the ten dharmic activities. 2
May the activities of renunciation and study continue without interruption.
And through the power and strength of the saṅgha's true indivisibility,
May all be auspicious for the teachings to spread in a hundred directions.

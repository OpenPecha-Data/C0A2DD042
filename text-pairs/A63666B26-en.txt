Prayer for the Long Life of Dzogchen Rinpoche
Samantabhadra, mighty Vajradhara and Padmasambhava,
And most supremely accomplished vidyādharas—all your forms like movements in a dance of emanation,
Most excellent and amazing in your kindness to the teachings and beings—
To the garland of your successive incarnations, I pray!
Most wondrous manifestation maintaining the transmission and realization of Buddha’s teachings,
Great bringer of light, the youthful sun of wisdom, with your perfect understanding and love,
Free from every fear of existence and quiescence, splendour of benefit and happiness,
May your light always shine on the summit of Sumeru, forever unchanging!

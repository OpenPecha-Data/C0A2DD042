Prayer to Jetsün Tārā for the Fulfilment of Wishes
Noble and compassionate Tārā, we pray to you:
May I and all sentient beings, infinite in number,
Purify the two obscurations and swiftly perfect the two accumulations,
And in so doing may we gain perfect enlightenment.
Until then, in all our lives,
May we find supreme happiness among gods and human beings,
And may all obstacles to the attainment of omniscience,
As well as harmful influences and disease,
All that brings untimely death,
All bad dreams and evil omens,
The eight major fears and all forms of harm,
All be swiftly pacified and eliminated.
May auspiciousness, happiness and prosperity,
Both worldly and transcendent,
Flourish and expand, and may all our wishes
Be effortlessly and spontaneously fulfilled.
May we endeavour in the practice, may the Dharma spread,
May we always meditate on you, and behold your perfect face,
May we realize the nature of emptiness, and
May precious bodhicitta develop and expand, just like the waxing moon.

A Means to Pacify the Fear of Natural Disasters
In order to pacify the fear of natural disasters,
I appear as Vajra Tārā, blue in colour—
Her right hand in the gesture of supreme generosity,
Her left in the mudrā of granting protection
And holding an utpala topped by a five-pronged vajra.
She is adorned with the silk and jewel ornaments.
Blessings and wisdom enter my three centres;
I am empowered; I present offerings, offer praise and pray.
At the deity’s heart, upon a moon disc is the blue syllable Tāṃ
Surrounded by the mantra garland,
Which emanates rays of light, all with the nature of the vajra,
Presenting offerings to noble ones and working for beings’ welfare.
In particular, I consider that the rays pacify all fears of natural disaster,
Which originate from a sense of self-importance.
oṃ tāre tuttare ture mama sarva laṃ laṃ bhaya śāntiṃ kuru svāhā

The Continuous Rain of Blessing A Supplication for the Sādhana of the Sublime Lady, Tārā
Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, Five Buddha Families, Three Protectors,
The Five Learned Ones, 1 the fortunate King Dza, and
Victorious Padmasambhava, along with the lords, subjects and companion –
Bless us and liberate all beings from the mire of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pray!
Dance-like emanation, who subdues beings and holds the transmission of profound terma,
Master of maṇḍalas, excellent treasure-revealer, Lerab Lingpa;
Together with the root and lineage lamas, vidyādharas all –
Bless us and liberate all beings from the mire of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pray!
With the Buddhas bearing witness, you pledged to awaken for the benefit of all –
Mother of the Victorious ones, divine embodiment of enlightened activity,
Jetsün Tārā, swift-moving heroine,
Bless us and liberate all beings from the mire of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pray!
Sarasvatī, She who Grants Supreme Merit,
Uṣṇīṣavijayā, Kurukullā, She who Causes Terror,
She who is Invincible, and She who is Victorious –
Bless us and liberate all beings from the mire of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pray!
Tārā of the Sandalwood Forest, She who is Victorious over the Three Worlds,
She who Bestows Wealth, She who Brings Auspiciousness, She who Vanquishes Opponents,
She who Wears a Wrathful Frown, She who is Perfect Peace, and Lady Ablaze with Light –
Bless us and liberate all beings from the mire of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pray!
She of Limitless Subjugation, Majestic as a Peacock, She who is Unconquerable and Victorious,
Parṇaśavarī who dwells in mountain solitude, and Mārīcī, ‘Rays of Light’ –
Myriad forms of the Sublime Lady, both peaceful and wrathful,
Bless us and liberate all beings from the mire of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, I pray!
As we pray to you like this, with unwavering faith,
Let those of us whose practice of sublime Dharma and awakening
Is obstructed, as we are lost in the thicket of faults and delusion
And plagued by the eight great fears and by karma and emotion,
Be guided by the white light of the Sublime Lady’s wisdom and compassion,
And, by means of the ladder of the four stages of the vidyādharas,
Cross the ocean of the qualities of abandonment and realization,
To find relief in perfect liberation, the Venerable Lady’s domain.

Offering Prayer to Changshönma, Protectress Riding upon a Wolf
Bhyoḥ! Mighty guardian of the teachings of Padma, lord over the rakṣasas,
One mother, goddess riding upon a wolf, together with your retinue,
Dispel all disharmony, increase positive and favourable circumstances,
And swiftly perform all the activities we request of you!

The Tree of Awakening A Prayer to the Great Abbot Śāntarakṣita
In devotion, I pay homage to the protector Mañjughoṣa!
Born into the sāla -like lineage of the kṣatriyas,
You mastered the five sciences and honoured Mañjughoṣa,
Offering the crown of your head for his lotus feet—
Great bodhisattva abbot, to you I pray.
With your altruistic resolve formed many aeons ago
As an utterly stable foundation like finest gold,
You are the sole ally of the teachings and beings in this age of turmoil—
Great abbot Śāntarakṣita, to you I pray.
Like a mighty skull-crushing vajra elephant, you defeated
The tīrthika s who were hostile to the teachings of the Buddha
In grammar and logic and through Middle Way reasoning —
Great lion of speech, to you I pray.
Upon the foundation of Vinaya teachings, like a golden mountain,
You fully elucidated the meaning of the Sūtras, profound and vast,
And beheld the ocean-like Abhidharma as if with a thousand eyes—
Great abbot, guru to the gods, to you I pray.
The sweet scent of your discipline delighted all including the devas,
Your profound meditative absorption brought undefiled qualities,
And your wisdom and courageous eloquence opened a hundred Dharma doors—
Second lord of sages for this world of Jambudvīpa, to you I pray.
You brought the chariot of the teachings of the Śākya Lion
To this northern land encircled by a chain of snowy peaks,
So that we may readily avail ourselves of the Three Piṭakas—
Lord of unparalleled kindness, to you I pray.
To the abbot prophesied by the victorious buddha,
Bodhisattva Śāntarakṣita,
Omniscient in actuality, great regent of the Teacher,
With single-pointed faith and devotion, I pray.
As I pray to you—not with empty mouthing but from the depths of my heart,
Grant your blessings so that the precious teachings spread in all directions,
Everywhere is flooded with ocean-like communities of the ethical,
And my three doors of body, speech and mind are made utterly pure.

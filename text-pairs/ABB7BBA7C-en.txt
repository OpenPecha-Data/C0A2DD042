A Prayer to Swiftly Fulfil All Wishes
Oṃ svasti
Lordly Guru, wisdom kāya of all buddhas and deities
Of the three roots throughout all time and directions, to simply recall you fulfills all wishes;
With your love, exalted knowledge and power,
Pray protect all beings and the Dharma during these most decadent of times!
Pray come quickly from the gandhola of the supreme field of Lotus Light,
To beautify this earth; show a magnificent aspect,
As holder of the life force, the very heart of the precious Buddha’s teachings,
To clear away the decadence of the age.
Pacify the aggression of demons and enemies,
As well as all obstacles — both outer and inner —
And grant us everything we desire with favorable circumstances.
Mahāguru, with your vajra blessing fulfill our wishes, right now!

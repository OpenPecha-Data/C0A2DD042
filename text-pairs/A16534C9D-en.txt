Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Dodrupchen Rinpoche
To the root guru, who embodies the Three Supreme Jewels,
I pray: please look upon me with your eyes of compassion!
Bless me, so that I may realize directly and without error
The naturally arising, clear-light nature of mind, the dharmakāya!
Through the power of the ocean-like, unfailing sources of refuge,
May the dance-like emanation of Jikmé Tubten Trinlé Palbar’s
Secret body, speech and mind swiftly reappear
And accomplish his vast vision for the teachings and sentient beings!

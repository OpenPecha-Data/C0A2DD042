The brilliance of your compassionate rays pervades all,
The potent, extraordinary power of your warmth a friend to the lotus buds of sentient beings and the teaching of Buddha—
May your supreme three secrets remain forever.

Touched by the moonlight of your hearing, contemplating and meditating,
Generates innumerable waves of exposition, debate and composition—
Foremost holder of the Buddha’s teaching, may you remain forever.
Through sincere motivation, faith and commitment,
Accompanied by the infinite blessing of the Three Rare and Sublime Ones,
May this prayer be swiftly accomplished,
Ushering in the highest, most beautiful auspiciousness throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

Prayer of Aspiration Incorporating the Eight Thoughts of Great Beings Who Follow the Way of the Mahāyāna
In time, may I eliminate all the sufferings
Of each and every living being!
In time, may I be able to bring those afflicted by poverty
To great wealth and affluence!
May these aspirations be perfectly fulfilled without obstacle!
In time, may this body of flesh and blood
Bring benefit to all living beings!
In time, even if I must remain for long within the hells,
May I be able to bring benefit to all sentient beings!
May these aspirations be perfectly fulfilled without obstacle!
In time, with great worldly
And supramundane wealth,
May I be able to fulfil entirely the wishes of living beings!
May this aspiration be perfectly fulfilled without obstacle!
In time, having become awakened,
May I be able to deliver all beings from suffering!
May this come to pass without obstacle,
And bring unfathomable benefit and wellbeing!
Being reborn in a way that brings no benefit to all,
Or relishing the experience of the ultimate, emptiness,
So that the methods of the path are interrupted—
May skilful means and wisdom never part ways like this!
Throughout all my lives,
May I never take delight
In words that fail to satisfy beings,
Or in ways of life, physical forms, intelligence,
Wealth or power that fail to benefit others,
Or in those who cause others harm.
May all the results of all the negative actions of all sentient beings
Ripen on me alone, and may all the results of my virtue
Ripen on all living beings!
And may all these beings attain the fruition of the three buddha-kāyas!
Through the infallible truth of the supreme Three Jewels,
And through the inconceivable force of love, compassion and jewel-like bodhicitta,
As well as the two profound levels of truth,
May this aspiration that is free from any selfish concern be fulfilled!

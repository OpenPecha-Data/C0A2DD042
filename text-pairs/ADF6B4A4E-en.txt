Brief Offering Prayer to the Oath-Bound Vajrasādhu
Hūṃ! Great oath-bound being, Vajrasādhu—Tiklé Tsal,
Along with those who delight you, the tenma goddesses, kiṃkaras and messengers,
And the assembly of three hundred and sixty brothers:
We supplicate you! We make this offering to you! Carry out the activities we request!

Prayer for the Long Life of Trulshik Dechen Pawo Dorje
Namo guru!
Through the power and strength of the truth, blessings and compassion
Of the Three Supreme Jewels and the infinite ocean of the Three Roots,
May any obstacles to the glorious guru’s longevity be dispelled,
And may he live long with permanent and unchanging stability.
With dualistic delusion dispersed in primordially pure basic space,
As a great and powerful vīra of self-liberation and great bliss,
One who is entirely victorious over the demonic forces of Māra,
May your lotus feet remain stable with the seven vajra qualities.
Supreme ally and defender of the teachings and beings,
May anything that obstructs your three secrets be entirely pacified,
And may all be auspicious and excellent, so you may remain
Inseparable from the great and glorious Vajrakumāra himself!

A Short Supplication to Tārā
With single-pointedness of body, speech and mind,
I respectfully supplicate the Mother of the Buddhas of the three times and their heirs,
The victorious one, foremost and exalted Tārā,
Indivisible from my guru, embodiment of all the Buddhas—
With your deathless and blissful vajra wisdom
Ripen and liberate me such that twofold benefit is swiftly won!

Mindrolling Lineage Prayer
Residing in the palace of the pure dharmadhātu,
Lord of beings with vision of the profound path’s essential point,
Son of the victors, Pema Gyurme Gyatso— 1
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings!
In the palace of the chakra of great and constant bliss,
Gracious lord guru, revealer of the supreme path,
Regent and guide Rinchen Namgyal— 2
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings!
In the pure dharmakāya realm of unchanging awareness,
Supreme yoginī, revealer of the excellent path of definitive meaning,
Jetsün Mingyur Palgyi Drönma—
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings!

A Prayer to Chöying Dorje
Orgyen Pema Jungne, embodiment of all the buddhas,
And Thangtong Gyalpo, lord of siddhas and builder of iron bridges,
Are indivisible from you, Chöying Dorje, Lord of Secrets.
I pray to you: dispel outer and inner obstacles!
Let me actualize clear light, the very nature of my mind,
Recognize all dharmas of deluded perception as dream-like,
And perfect the realization of Cutting Through and Direct Crossing!
Bless me, that I may spontaneously accomplish the twofold benefit!

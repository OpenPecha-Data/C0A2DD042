The earth is the golden ground, completely pure, full of beauty and power.
oṃ vajrarekhe āḥ hūṃ
The circular iron mountain wall completely surrounds it; in the centre is the letter hūṃ—
Meru, the king of mountains;
In the East is Pūrvavideha, in the South is Jambudvīpa,
In the West is Aparagodānīya, in the North is Uttarakuru.
Beside them are Deha and Videha, Cāmara and Aparacāmara,
Śāthā and Uttaramantriṇa,
Kurava and Kaurava.
The jewel mountain, the wish-fulfilling trees,
The wish-fulfilling cows, the harvest which needs no sowing,
The precious wheel, the precious gem,
The precious queen, the precious minister,
The precious elephant, the precious horse,
The precious general, the vase of great treasure,
The goddess of beauty, the goddess of garlands,
The goddess of song, the goddess of dance,
The goddess of flowers, the goddess of incense,
The goddess of light, the goddess of perfume,
The sun, the moon, the precious umbrella,
The royal banner victorious in all directions:
There is all the bountiful wealth of gods and men, complete and flawless—
All this:
I offer—
Please accept it, with compassion, for the benefit of beings.
Having accepted it, please grant your blessing!

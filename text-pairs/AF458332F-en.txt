Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Yangthang Rinpoche
Supreme teacher, incomparable king of the Śākyas,
Avalokiteśvara and omnipresent Padmasambhava,
Assembly of devas, sages, vidyādharas and guardians,
Cause this prayer of aspiration to bear fruit here and now!
Magical play of the secret body, speech and mind of the infinite Victorious Ones,
Do not merge into the basic space of the all-pervasive dharmakāya,
But now, in this final age of fivefold degeneracy for the buddha’s teachings,
Carry out, O protector, your compassionate pledges and commitments.
Vidyādhara regent and guide for these degenerate times,
Although you might rest a while on the Copper-Coloured Mountain of Glory,
Return once more, like the splendour of spring, and let the moon-like face
Of your reincarnation swiftly appear to all fortunate disciples.
By the compassion of the Three Jewels, buddhas and bodhisattvas,
And the force of our prayers based on pure faith and samaya,
May your supreme nirmāṇakāya incarnation swiftly appear
And spontaneously carry out great waves of activity for the teachings and beings.

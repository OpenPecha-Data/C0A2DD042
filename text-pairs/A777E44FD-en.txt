Prayer of Aspiration for the Buddhist Teachings to Flourish in Taiwan
From the vast dharmakāya expanse of primordial purity free from complexity,
The spontaneously present rūpakāya blazes with the splendour of the signs and marks,
And skilfully brings down a shower of Dharma from the clouds of loving kindness—
Lord of sages, supreme teacher of gods and humans, playfully appear in the centre of my heart.
In the centre of the protective sphere of the deep blue ocean,
Is this land that is like an arena of perfect abundance and beauty—
Here, through the splendour of the two systems 1 and four aspects of wellbeing, 2
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through guarding the key instructions for turning the mind toward the Dharma—
The rarity of the freedoms and opportunities and the impermanence of life,
As well as the sufferings of cyclic existence and the effects of actions,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through the stages of practice that bring progress in genuine Dharma—
Taking refuge in the Three Jewels, training in love and compassion,
Gathering the two accumulations and purifying the two obscurations,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through the practice of guru yoga which dispels all adversity,
Instructions on the swift path of transference (phowa) and so on,
And with confidence in finding a path to liberation at the time of death,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through transforming impure, deluded perception into perception that is pure,
While experiencing deity, mantra and dharmakāya as the self-radiance of awareness and emptiness,
And the channels, wind-energies and essences as supports for bliss and emptiness,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through recognising one’s own nature of primordially pure awareness and emptiness,
And with decisive certainty about its creative manifestations, pure and impure,
So that one gains the confidence of self-liberation beyond hope and fear,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Without getting caught in clinging to space, light-spheres and awareness,
Which arise as the natural radiance of the lamp of self-arisen wisdom—
Through skilful practice of these most secret, unsurpassable teachings—
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as the master Xuanzang, who took birth in China,
Travelled, through his magnificent aspirations, to the noble land of India,
Where, through enduring hardships, he reached the pinnacle of scholarship,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as the great elder noble Kaśyapa and the rest,
In their line of succession, skilfully upheld the teachings,
Now with saffron-robed monks adorned with threefold training—
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as in the Land of Snows, as the Buddha himself foretold,
Through the force of Avalokiteśvara’s vows and aspirations,
A pair of dharma kings appeared to herald a new dawn,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as Atiśa, heart-son of the precious lord of Suvarnadvīpa
And pre-eminent among the learned and accomplished of the noble land,
Set the torch of the Kadampa teachings ablaze—
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
By practising according to the instructions of Marpa of Lhodrak,
Holding aloft the golden victory banner of the practice lineage,
Just like Milarepa, who attained liberation in a single lifetime,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as the fame of the Sakya tradition spread throughout the world,
And caused the two traditions to flourish once again in the Land of Snows,
So that supremely learned scholars congregated in every direction—
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as the glorious Jonangpas skilfully propagated the teachings
Of Kālacakra and the unsurpassed final turning of the Dharma-wheel
And caused teachings on the ‘essence of definitive meaning’ to spread,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Just as Lobzang Drakpa, who was prophesied by the victorious lord Padma,
Followed many learned adepts and won the splendour of threefold excellence,
To become skilled in upholding Buddha’s teaching that unites sūtra and mantra,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through the blossoming of the lotus garden of non-sectarian Buddhist teachings,
Pacifying threats from external enemies and hindrances as well as the four elements,
Dispelling the poison of internal attachment, aversion and ignorance,
And secretly maturing the mindstream through bodhicitta—the spirit of awakening,
May the essence of the Buddha's teachings flourish in this land!
Through the blessings of the Three Jewels, Three Roots and guardian deities,
And through the power of the truth of my own pure altruistic intention,
May all disharmony, adversity and signs of deterioration be pacified,
And may all be auspicious so that lifespan, merit, glory and prosperity increase!

Prayer to the Gurus of the Chöd Lineage
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
To the great mother of the expansive dharmakāya, I pray!
Grant your blessings so that inspiration infuses my mind!
To the saṃbhogakāya Vajravārāhī, I pray!
To the nirmāṇakāya Machik Labdrön, I pray!
Ha, to the ḍākinīs of the vajra family, I pray!
Ri, to the ḍākinīs of the ratna family, I pray!
Ni, to the ḍākinīs of the padma family, I pray!
Sa, to the ḍākinīs of the karma family, I pray!
Baṃ, to the ḍākinīs of the buddha family, I pray!
To the lineage of the method-based father tantras, I pray!
To the lineage of the wisdom-based mother tantras, I pray!
To the lineage of the experience-based son tantras, I pray!
To the lineage of profound Chöd practice, I pray!
The causes are the three of desire, anger and ignorance—
May thoughts involving these three poisions fade away!
The conditions are male spirits, female spirits and nāga-spirits—
May thoughts influenced by these three harmful spirits subside!
Dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya—
May I actualize these three buddha-bodies!
Outwardly, all the various appearances of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
And inwardly, the natural expressions of my own empty mind—
They all lack beginning, middle or end and are intangible.
The dualistic perception of objects and mind is without basis or origin.
Within the natural self-illumination of spontaneously arising wisdom
There is nothing to abandon or adopt, neither hope nor fear;
So within this fresh and natural state, which is free from pride,
May I nakedly perceive the crucial point and realize self-liberation!

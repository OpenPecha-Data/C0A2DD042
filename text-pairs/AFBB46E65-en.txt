A Concise Sang Offering to Tārā
Tāṃ! Jetsün Tārā, sole mother of all the buddhas,
Along with your twenty-one emanations and further emanations,
Who accomplish all activities of pacification, enrichment, control and wrath,
Pray come here without impediment or delay.
I present to you the delights of gods and human beings – actually arranged and mentally emanated –
Along with smoke plumes of offerings, tormas, and other substantial offerings.
May this region, and this sacred site in particular,
Be free from any trace of danger or disharmony;
May all illness of man and beast be cured and overcome;
May there be timely rains, abundant harvests and plentiful livestock.
In essence, may we yogins, along with our families and friends,
Become influential, powerful and wealthy; may the Dharma teachings spread and communities flourish;
May our lifespan and spiritual and temporal influence grow like the waxing moon;
And may all be auspicious, so that they continue to expand for evermore!

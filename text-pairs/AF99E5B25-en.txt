The Drum of Deathlessness A Prayer for the Long Life of Minling Chung Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti.
Through the blessings of Pema Tötreng, embodiment and face of the Three Roots,
As well as Trisong Detsen, Vairotsana, Yeshe Tsogyal and the rest,
All the vidyādharas of the Kama and Terma lineages,
And through the power of truth, may everything be auspicious, I pray.
The profound and vast Dharma treasury of the Ancient Translations' sūtra and mantra,
With which the golden chest of your wisdom is replete,
You distribute through the force of great love and compassion—
Ngawang Chökyi Drakpa, may your life remain secure.
Since, with the power and strength of the great valiant Vajrapāṇi,
You have entered the maṇḍala of the supreme three secrets,
Now, to protect and guard the teachings and beings of this degenerate age,
May your lotus feet remain steadfast long into the future.
In the great dharma kingdom of maturing and liberating through the definitive secret,
May you raise aloft the victory banner of teaching and practising the precious teachings,
Thoroughly subdue the hosts of demonic forces and asuras,
And continue to reign victorious in great prosperity, I pray.
Through an auspicious rain of blessings from the gurus, Three Roots,
Dharma guardians, wealth deities, treasure keepers and the rest,
May all be virtuous and excellent, so that these words of prayer
Come to be fulfilled just as I wish.

“They should recite this mantra many times and then go to sleep
With palms joined, they should make prostrations with the five limbs in all the cardinal and secondary directions and recite the words of this mantra
I will anchor them in all the mental states from the four sublime abodes up to great compassion,’ and they should all pay homage to the bodhisattva Akāśagarbha
“In a remote place, or in the open plains, or in an unsheltered place, they should burn incense of aloe wood and Chinese incense at specific times
‘By whatever means necessary, I will place these beings’ minds in unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment, I will familiarize them with skillful means
Those who are never lacking in great compassion, and who observe themselves and practice equanimity toward all beings, should think
Or he will employ such methods as using words in a similar way
That method alone has the power to bring billions of billions of beings to complete maturity
This shows that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha possesses inconceivable qualities
who do not belittle others and do not praise themselves
who have abandoned jealousy and greed
who are free from hypocrisy
and have altruistic minds—such beings are all deeply loved by this son of noble family
Moreover, since they dedicate all the roots of virtue to enlightenment
they will never turn away from attaining the state of unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
This shows that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha possesses determination and good qualities that are inconceivable, and that he brings all sentient beings to complete maturation.
The bodhisattva Maitreya asked the Bhagavān
The Bhagavān replied
whereas other bodhisattvas do not possess anything like it?
“Bhagavān, for what purpose does this son of noble family carry on his head, the holiest part of the body, a precious jewel shining with brilliant bright light
“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha possesses great compassion
he benefits beings
and liberates them from great suffering
For those drowning in the pitch black darkness of ignorance and those tormented by their negative views, he is like the sun
He brings them to disclose their root transgressions; he lifts the doubts from their hearts
For those whose hearts have become like a broken vessel
who are protectorless, devoid of support, abandoned by all the wise ones—for all of them, this son of noble family is like a crutch
who have fallen, who have committed a fundamental transgression, who have destroyed all their virtuous qualities, who are bound for the lower realms
He shows the way
reveals and cleanses all negative actions and all stains
He turns beings away from the paths leading to the lower realms
He is like a chariot
He establishes beings in the higher realms and in the state of liberation
For all beings who have minds entangled in intense desire or intense hatred
who grope in darkness because of extreme dullness
who proclaim the non-existence of causality
who hold the view that one should be fearless concerning the next life
who lack contentment in their accumulation of wealth
and whose minds are constantly involved in all the ten unwholesome actions, this son of noble family performs every role, from closing the door to the lower realms up to serving as a chariot
He establishes those sentient beings in the higher realms and in the state of liberation
“For these reasons, with the exception of the tathāgata, arhat, completely perfect buddhas, the whole world including the gods should worship this son of noble family.
Bodhisattva Maitreya asked
“Bhagavān, sentient beings stained by a root transgression forfeit their roots of virtue and are bound for the lower realms
The Bhagavān answered
“Son of noble family, there are five root transgressions for a kṣatriya on whom royal authority has been bestowed
By committing any of these root transgressions, a kṣatriya upon whom royal authority has been bestowed will forfeit all previously generated roots of virtue, and will be in a state of transgression
Such a kṣatriya will be deprived of all the happiness of the god and human realms, and will go to the lower realms
“What are these five transgressions
these constitute the first root transgression
"Forcing someone to give up the Dharma
whether it is the instructions on the śrāvakas’ definite deliverance
the instructions on the pratyekabuddhas’ definite deliverance
as well as creating obstacles to the teachings, or concealing them: all of these constitute the second root transgression
Such a kṣatriya will be deprived of any happiness of the god and human realms
and will be bound for the lower realms
“When that happens, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will manifest his birth and appear in an uncivilized land or another place
He will be in a state of transgression
“Son of noble family, if a kṣatriya on whom royal authority has been bestowed commits any of these five root transgressions, this kṣatriya will forfeit all previously generated roots of virtue
“Furthermore, a kṣatriya commits the fourth root transgression with any one of these five heinous deeds: purposely killing one’s own mother, father, or a śrāvaka, arhat, or the Bhagavān; dividing the saṅgha; or purposely and out of negative intention causing a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha to bleed
Finally, for a minister to commit one or more of the five heinous deeds constitutes the fifth root transgression
resorting to corporal punishment
Destroying a village, a district, or a town constitutes the second root transgression
Stealing from a place of worship or from the saṅgha of the four directions is considered the first root transgression of a minister
What are these five
“Maitreya, the transgressions of a minister are also five in number
They will reprimand themselves and disclose, give up, and abandon negative actions
They will develop great enthusiasm for giving, discipline, taking precepts, and determination, and they will reach the higher realms
However and wherever he manifests, he will explain the Dharma to such kṣatriyas
manifesting for some in the form, attire, and conduct of a monastic, for others in the form, attire, and conduct of a brahmin 
“Son of noble family, if a minister commits any of the five root transgressions he will forfeit all previously generated roots of virtue, and will be in a state of transgression
For some beings he will manifest in the form, attire, and conduct of a monk, for others in various other forms and attires, including that of a girl, and he will teach the Dharma
Which are the five
They are killing
taking what was not given
impure conduct
lying, and physically harming or drawing blood from the body of a tathāgata
These are the five
To some he teaches in the form of a monastic with the appropriate attire and conduct, and so forth, including all forms previously mentioned, and those beings will reach the higher realms
“Son of noble family, there are five root transgressions for śrāvakas
“There are eight root transgressions for sons of noble family who are beginners and who have correctly embarked on the Mahāyāna path
What are the eight
They will betray their bodhicitta, the mind of enlightenment, and go to the lower realms
“It is like this
Just as, for instance, one travels the great ocean in stages, similarly bodhisattvas must initially know other sentient beings, their inclinations and latent tendencies
In accordance with the other beginner bodhisattvas’ predispositions, they must teach the Dharma step by step
“The bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha manifests his birth and appears in different places for their benefit
and will soon manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
In vajra-like manner, they will rely upon the six perfections with great strength and determination
As a result, they will be completely liberated from the lower realms and will not turn back from attaining perfectly complete enlightenment
He establishes them in meditative concentration, tolerance, the dhāraṇīs, and the grounds
He also teaches them expertise in skillful means, the profound conduct of the unsurpassable Mahāyāna
and cause the beginner bodhisattvas to disclose their root transgressions just as they occurred
“Having seen such sentient beings, this son of noble family will manifest in a form corresponding to their respective fortunes
Thus, in the presence of some, he will manifest in an ordinary form and teach the Dharma
In the presence of others, he will teach in the form of a brahmin, and in the presence of yet others he may manifest in any other form, including the form of a girl
Therefore, if beginner bodhisattvas who have incurred such a root transgression and are terrified by the lower realms hear the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha and wish to see him in order to disclose those transgressions
“Furthermore, beginner bodhisattvas may say to some
‘Oh! What is the use of practicing the vinaya of individual liberation, ethical discipline, and good conduct
Speaking such words is the second root transgression for a beginner bodhisattva
Therefore, quickly turn your minds to either the śrāvaka vehicle or the pratyekabuddha vehicle and you will swiftly be definitively released from saṃsāra.
You are not able to manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
‘You are not able to engage in the practice of the six perfections
“Furthermore, beginner bodhisattvas may say to some people
They will firmly abide by the Mahāyāna and swiftly come to complete the six perfections
This enables the beginner bodhisattvas to obtain the meditative concentration called not forgetting the mind of enlightenment at that very moment
He also teaches primordial wisdom endowed with skillful means
and with great skillful means of primordial wisdom he will lead them to disclose their root transgressions
Here too, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will appear at the break of dawn in the dreams of those beginner bodhisattvas who have committed a transgression
“Then they should go back to bed to sleep
Lead me to obtain the great eyes of wisdom endowed with the skillful means of the noble Mahāyāna
Please show yourself in my dreams so that I may disclose my root transgressions
Convey these words of mine to Ākāśagarbha, the one of great compassion
Aruṇa, as soon as you have risen in this world, enfold me in your compassion
“If he does not directly appear in front of them, the beginner bodhisattvas should rise before dawn and pray to Aruṇa
Some beginner bodhisattvas among them listen to the collection of sūtras that present the most profound emptiness, transmit, and read them
They will be deprived of the happiness of gods, of humans, and of the Mahāyāna, go to the lower realms, be separated from a spiritual friend, and remain in saṃsāra for a very long time
These root transgressions cause confusion, and beginners who have correctly entered the Mahāyāna will forfeit the entirety of their previously generated roots of virtue, and they will be in a state of transgression
This is the first root transgression for a beginner bodhisattva
“Son of noble family, due to this root transgression, they will forfeit the entirety of their previously generated roots of virtue
Because they are terrified, they turn back from attaining unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment and aspire to the vehicle of the śrāvakas
When those ordinary, immature beings who have not gone through arduous training hear such profound sūtras, they become extremely frightened and terrified
In the presence of other sentient beings who understand as little as those just mentioned, they recall these sūtras in great detail in word and meaning, just as they heard and understood them, and they teach them to others
Do not listen to them, do not read them, and do not teach them to others
Once they have been greatly honored and venerated by the kṣatriyas and their retinues and have received their offerings
They are the reason why you cannot obtain the great result
And the kṣatriyas together with their retinues become angry at the bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment, and disparage them
“If the support and material riches that were destined for the bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment are offered to the bhikṣus exerting themselves in recitation, at this point, then both actions become root transgressions
Why
Because the bhikṣu meditators are holy
‘Son of noble family, eschew the discourses of the śrāvaka vehicle
Son of noble family, eschew the discourses of the śrāvaka vehicle
while those who only recite and advise others are not
“Furthermore, son of noble family, beginner bodhisattvas may say to some
Therefore, have faith in the discourses of the Mahāyāna
Listen to the Mahāyāna
why you are not able to eradicate the afflictions
study the Mahāyāna
and teach it to others
and swiftly you will manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment.
If these words are spoken and the listener acts accordingly and adopts a similar view, then both actions incur a root transgression
This is the fourth root transgression of beginner bodhisattvas
“Furthermore, beginner bodhisattvas may be two-faced
they criticize, in front of the householders, the other bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment
“Son of noble family, since they have no misgivings concerning such actions and fear no consequences, this is the eighth root transgression for beginner bodhisattvas
You should swiftly bring forth the mind that strives for unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment and study the Mahāyāna
When beginner bodhisattvas commit these root transgressions, they forfeit all previously generated roots of virtue
“Son of noble family, for the benefit of beginner bodhisattvas, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha is born and appears in the places where such bodhisattvas dwell
Therefore, you must meditate on this profound Dharma in order to directly perceive it an
To some he teaches in the form of a monastic with the appropriate attire and conduct, displaying to others a variety of forms, from that of a brahmin with the proper attire and conduct to the semblance and conduct of an animal
They say, ‘I have understood these teachings with my own intelligence; I teach them to you in this way because I am compassionate
For an extensive explanation of this, one should read the Sūtra on the Meditative ‌Concentration of Brave Progression (Śūraṃgama­samādhi­sūtra)
“Ākāśagarbha teaches the Dharma in various places according to the specificities of various beings
Therefore, beginner bodhisattvas incur a very weighty transgression when they lie out of jealousy
This is the fifth root transgression for beginner bodhisattvas
Aruṇa, Aruṇa, endowed with great compassion
and pray to the god Aruṇa, uttering these words
“If he does not show himself to them directly, the beginner bodhisattvas who pray to him and who have erred in their ways should rise during the watch of dawn, stand facing the eastern direction
In the same way, even though these beginner bodhisattvas wish to cross the great ocean of the Mahāyāna
they destroy their boat of faith and part from the vital force of wisdom when they lie out of jealousy
In this way they swiftly come to manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
As quick as a flash of lightning, they thereby become very strong and determined in the practice of the six perfections
“The analogy here is of a group of people who wish to go to a jewel island and set out to cross the great ocean by boat, but the boat breaks apart in the great ocean
He frees them completely from their immense fear of the lower realms and establishes them on the stage of not turning away from unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
On the various bodhisattva grounds, he establishes them in meditative concentration, dhāraṇīs, and tolerance by having them gradually practice the entire eightfold path
“He displays his profound skill in means and shows them how to engage in the unsurpassable Mahāyāna
“Furthermore, son of noble family, in the future kṣatriyas will have dishonorable advisors and ministers, dishonorable soldiers and physician
This, again, is the sixth root transgression for beginner bodhisattvas
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Because of those transgressions, they are very frightened and terrified. They disclose the transgressions, give them up, and reject them
Anyone who does rely upon such a person is definitely unwise
Thus did I hear at one time
“If, upon hearing the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, those beings wish to see him, and if, fearful of falling to the lower realms
No kṣatriya, brahmin, vaiśya, or śūdra will rely upon such a person
The Bhagavān was dwelling on the Khalatika Mountain, in the abode of the Sage’s hermits
together with an incalculably large assembly of monks and of great śrāvakas
forming an incalculably immense assembly of bodhisattvas, were also staying there
The moment the Bhagavān completed his prophecy on the splendid vows of the tathāgatas
Great fortunate one! As soon as you have risen in this world, enfold me in your compassion
the Indranīla jewel appeared in the west
Many hundreds of thousands of precious wish-fulfilling jewels spread out and surrounded it
Summon the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, who is endowed with great compassion, with these my words
Show yourself in my dreams that I may disclose my transgressions
Lead me to obtain the skillful means and wisdom of the noble Mahāyāna.’“Having spoken these words, they should go back to bed to sleep
The light of that precious jewel rendered invisible the totality of manifest form in the whole trichiliocosm
Then, at the first light of dawn in this world, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will come and appear in the dreams of those beginner bodhisattvas, in the guise of an ordinary person, and will make them disclose their root transgressions
In doing so, he causes his own death
With great primordial wisdom and skillful means, that expert in skillful means and primordial wisdom will bring these beginner bodhisattvas to attain the meditative concentration called not forgetting bodhicitta, the mind of enlightenment at that very moment
They will come to firmly abide by the Mahāyāna, to swiftly complete the six perfections, and, before long, to manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment. Such skillful means and wisdom will he also teach them
Son of noble family, this is why the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha bears the precious wish-fulfilling jewel, which arises from great bravery, on his head, the holiest part of the body
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha is endowed with inconceivable excellent qualities
Having deceived gods and humans using the Mahāyāna, there will be no śrāvaka vehicle of the buddha for those bodhisattvas, much less the Mahāyāna
or the particular realizations which are the entry into the Mahāyāna, or unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
“Furthermore, son of noble family, if beings who have heard the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha
who draw his form or have made offerings to him
A heavy transgression has occurred
Therefore, in the eyes of the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddhas of the three times, bodhisattva mahāsattvas, and noble beings, they have become stained by faults
Everything appeared to be limitless, boundless, and ineffable like space
The Bhagavān, too, became most radiant, clear, and brilliant
is said to be like the person in this analogy
rich and powerful fools who are proud of their expertise
Whatever they observed, howsoever they observed it, they saw as empty
They did not even see the orbs of the sun or the moon
The stars and the earth element
water element, fire element
and air element also became invisible to their eyes
Sounds did not resonate in their ears
Odors were not perceived by their noses
They did not take their minds and their mental events as “me,” or take them as “mine,” an
the perceptions of the six cognitive bases did not arise
The great elements were also imperceptible
Because such duties have been organized, the bhikṣus are harmed
Instead, in whichever direction they looked
They abandon the practices of calm abiding and special insight
Harmful intentions multiply in those meditators, as a result of which they cannot pacify their unpacified emotions
As these do not subside
in all those directions they saw everything as the physical marks, colors, shapes, and bodies of the tathāgatas
Only the precious Indranīla encircled by wish-fulfilling jewels appeared from afar; apart from that, nothing at all was visible
nor will they be killed with weapons or poison
these bhikṣus then degenerate in terms of intention, ethical discipline, conduct, and view
Therefore, they become negligent, and ever more negligent, and their ethical discipline degenerates
Except when their lives are naturally exhausted, no one—neither humans nor non-humans—will be able to rob them of their life force
Even though they are not monastics, they pretend to be, and even though they do not lead a chaste life they pretend to
They resemble donkeys, and they explain the Dharma most clearly
At that place, the bodhisattvas dwelling on the tenth ground, who had achieved the meditative concentration of brave progression
and who were bound by one more lif
They declare pure Dharma to be non-Dharma, and refer to that which is non-Dharma as Dharma, thus abandoning the true Dharma
and in their last existence, looked and saw, yet were not at all frightened, afraid, or terrified
“Furthermore, those dishonorable kṣatriyas together with the monastics commit the following fault
hear sounds with their ears
And those dishonorable people in turn will offer this to the kṣatriyas
smell odors with their noses
experience tastes with their tongues
The remaining great bodhisattva mahāsattvas
or experience tactile objects with their bodies
the śrāvakas, devas, nāgas
yakṣas, gandharvas
asuras, garuḍas
kiṃnaras, mahoragas
kumbhāṇḍas, pretas
piśācas, pūtanas
as well as separation between the monastics and the kṣatriyas
They were bewildered about what was here and what was there, and in their confusion they were not able to perceive one another
kaṭapūtanas—all of the assembled humans and non-humans—were very frightened and in despair
“Ordinary beings do not recognize The nature of all phenomena
They live in the form aggregate
And so their six sense faculties become deluded
There is not a single aggregate to be seen
Whether in dreams or during waking hours, in all these ways the skillful one teaches the path directly and with straightforward methods
It is for them that the Bhagavān Taught the characteristics of the suchness of phenomena
These methods quickly liberate beings from negative views and actions, from unwholesome intentions, from wrong objects of refuge, and from a mind engaged in negativity
Thus, here and there They come to know the characteristics of space, which bears everything
“Appearing before beings who have strong faith in the Buddha
Having understood these Dharmas, these beings will reach the higher realms.
This indeed is brave equipoise
“ ‘Whoever has insight into the four truths of the noble ones Is liberated from existence in saṃsāra. Therefore, those dwelling in saṃsāra should know all four
A state that cannot be expressed
“A most precious wish-fulfilling jewel Rests on the crown of his head
They will quickly be freed from stains, from mental afflictions, and from negative views
Those who perceive a precious Indranīla jewel from afar Are very fortunate beings
They will perfect the brave progression
“All who have come to see the Teacher are wise indeed
Today in this place, a profound discourse Will undoubtedly be proclaimed
The Bhagavān replied: “It is just as you have said
The place where the all-basis is heard
They will, however, continue to breathe out and breathe in with a subtle breath, and their life force, warmth, and consciousness will still remain in their bodies
At that time, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will show himself to them as an ordinary person
To those beings who in the past revered the brahmins, this son of noble family will show himself in the form of a brahmin
All the unwholesome paths that lead to the lower realms will swiftly be purified by the power of aspirations and the activities of excellent conduct
He also teaches the methods that allow beings to swiftly gain control over their own minds and abide in profound tolerance
“If those sentient beings who suffer from various physical diseases
And where, with wisdom, sentient beings are established, That place is the sphere of activity of meditative concentration
whose minds are distracted
who have impaired eyesight
he will display the form of the Buddha and utter these words
who are inarticulate
“ ‘The truth of the Buddha’s primordial wisdom Frees those dwelling in the ocean of existence
“It is the sphere of activity Of the Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha
Swiftly attain that primordial wisdom, And you will be liberated from all suffering.
or who are physically disabled in any way
Who has demonstrated the meditative concentration free of appearances And free of proliferations
“Whoever is attached to the two views Will later be in a realm of delusion
and offer perfume and incense of aloe wood
and offer perfume and incense of aloe wood
The same can be said with respect to the Dharma and the Saṅgha
This shows that the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha is endowed with inconceivable excellent qualities
That is to say
they must understand the nature of the great elements to be arising and perishing
“Those who wish to perfectly master different kinds of meditative concentration should pay homage to the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha during the watch of dawn and make as many offerings as possible
“Thus will they definitively abandon eternalism and nihilism
and they will not be at all frightened or terrified
Establishing the mind in loving kindness for all sentient beings, they should then utter these words
In the dreams he will sit before sick people and manifest whatever appropriate medicine and instruments can pacify their illness. And with one treatment he will heal all illness
“Listen well, companions: for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are beginners one must explain the six perfections with a reference point, with the notion that suchness is expressible
‘Give heed, give heed to me. Ākāśagarbha, you have achieved great compassion
Thereby swiftly attaining the grounds
I pray, please bestow upon me mindfulness and the yoga of meditative concentration
those who desire good qualities
long for solitude
“Those who wish to free themselves Completely from both of these views Should meditate on that which is inexpressible
“Similarly, the son of noble family teaches the appropriate methods to those who desire good advice or possessions, wish to recite prayers and to study
Bhagavān, a bodhisattva mahāsattva who understands all phenomena in this way attains acceptance that all phenomena are non-arising
Attachment to eternalism and nihilism Is utter delusion about here and there
Bhagavān, it is thus
Once they have ceased to relate to phenomena with attachment, they will swiftly perfect the six perfection
Thereupon, extending his right arm, the Bhagavān proclaimed
“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha’s meditative concentration is like an ocean
This bodhisattva’s training is like Mount Meru
his primordial wisdom like space
Son of noble family, when you use this dhāraṇī of the majestic lion turning backwards, which overwhelms everyone who sees him, at the time of death
his vigor like wind
and his tolerance like a vajra
He is like a supreme victory banner among all bodhisattvas
Pray bestow upon me the yoga of mindfulness and meditative concentration
For voyagers to nirvāṇa, he is like a captain
and speak these words
generate loving kindness for all sentient beings
He is like a treasure of all the roots of virtue
make as many offerings as possible
should first bathe and then pay homage to the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha at the break of dawn
For all who suffer, he is like a wishing vase
for those engulfed in darkness, like the sun
for those who have lost their way, like the moon
for the frightened, like Mount Meru
for those severely tormented by the sickness of afflictions, like a medicinal elixir
for those who have severed the roots of virtue and fallen, like a walking stick
For those who make a living by weaving garlands, he is like a flower
for those who observe vows, like a mirror
for those who have conscientiousness and modesty, like clothing
for travelers to nirvāṇa, like a footbridge
for voyagers to the other shore, like a boat
for travelers to the higher realms, like a staircase
For those suffering from insults and slander, he is like a parasol
for those facing opposition, like a lion
for the rains, like water
for those fighting against Māra, like armor
for those who have mistaken the precepts, like the opening of their eyes
for all harvests of the roots of virtue, like the earth
For the sick he is like a doctor
“Those who wish to enter the great ocean or caves, or to make use of the sacred essence
who have been imprisoned, are separated from friends
When the Bhagavān had spoken these words
the monks, the entire retinue, and the whole world, including gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the Bhagavān’s teachings
Tens of thousands of beings attained acceptance that all phenomena are non-arising
whereas for others the wisdom of the ten grounds arose
for the hungry, like grain
for the thirsty, like a water crystal
for the exhausted, like a bed
for those in meditative concentration, like a fire lens
for those playing in parks, like a pool
make as many offerings as possible, settle the mind in loving kindness for all sentient beings, and utter these words
for those striving toward enlightenment, like a rosary. Thus does he appear
for those who have entered the path to enlightenment, like a chariot
“This son of noble family is like the fruition of the perfections
You will bring sentient beings to maturity in such a way that all of them, from the lowliest among the kṣatriyas up to the lowliest among the monastics, will be able to abandon the negative dharmas and will abide by the wholesome dharmas.
like a wish-fulfilling jewel for those on the tenth ground
like a wish-fulfilling tree for those who have achieved the meditative concentration of brave progression
For all who are engaged in negative views, he is like a weapon because he severs
for those afflicted beings entangled in latent tendencies, he is like a vajra because he overcomes
This completes the Noble Mahāyāna Ākāśagarbha Sūtra
The demons cannot conquer him. For those of skillful means, he is the measure of time
Edited, translated, and established by the Indian abbot Śākyaprabha and the monk Ratnarakṣita
for primordial wisdom, he is discernment. For the entire Buddhadharma, he is the abode
for pratyekas, like a garland
for all śrāvakas, like the robes
for gods, like an eye
for humans, like a path
and offer perfume and incense of aloe wood
pay homage
for those born in the animal realm, a shelter; for pretas, a support; for hell beings, a protector
may utter the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha
Even those sentient beings who, suffering in the desolate place of saṃsāra, have become polluted by their negative views, and do not know the means to reach the higher realms and liberation
are shackled
or punished
and cures the body’s poisons, the diseases derived from the four great elements
or are about to be killed
those who are struck by a disease or who are afraid of diseases
For all the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddhas of the three times, this son of noble family is like a minister
“This son of noble family, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, shows all beings the way to rebirth in the higher realms and to liberation
He is the gatekeeper of the city of Dharma
He frees them completely of the disease of mental afflictions
This son of noble family possesses the perfect buddhas’ primordial wisdom complete with all adornments, including the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha
He is like the supreme victory banner of all bodhisattvas, suitable for a king
This son of noble family is someone whom all sentient beings, with the exception of the tathāgatas, should worship with every supreme offering
He possesses all the ocean-like qualities of a buddha, has no doubt, and is a wise person who does not need to depend on others’ wisdom
Therefore, all of you who have gathered here should now welcome him
“This son of noble family abides in the understanding of skillful means
Thus he abides in the qualities of the profound Dharma
“Then the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will appear in front of them, in various forms including that of a common person and that of a girl
and he will bring them relief and free them from whatever fears they may have
If the son of noble family had manifested a display of unborn ultimate reality, the world’s inhabitants, including the gods, would have become confused and defiled
He also showed a great display of meditative concentration
Supremely powerful one, I am worn out by suffering. I am destitute
He manifested melodies sung by the glorious gandharvas
“Ordinary sentient beings, however, became very disheartened, so he then showed a great display, created on the level of relative truth, in order to bring all sentient beings to complete maturity
but instead came from the western direction to this place and displayed meditative concentration and the supernatural knowledge of the bases of perception of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and of the extraordinary beings of the boundless infinity of space
The son of noble family did not appear in this way to those beings
It was free of mountains, high lands, rocky landscapes, caves, ravines, abysses, grasses, walls, soil, thorns, unpleasant odors, and so on, and was smooth like the palm of a hand
Indeed, some of the beings came here for the great display. In order to observe meditative concentration and a great display, one must abide on the level of freedom from attachment
Hence, he knows the mentalities and latent tendencies of the beings now present in my great assembly
At that very moment, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha manifested this buddhafield, the Sahā world, as being made entirely of seven precious materials
Sometimes he manifests in the form of a buddha in order to ripen sentient beings
He is endowed with a great ocean-like mind
“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha is endowed with the excellent quality of such skillful means
He will also teach them such skillful means
Even if all sentient beings had become pratyekabuddhas, who dwell alone like the rhinoceros
the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will hear this with the purified faculty of divine hearing which is beyond human capacity and show himself to those beings in whatever form is appropriate
that assembly were bodhisattva mahāsattvas and śrāvakas, the lord of devas
Having heard the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, those who wish to be promoted to a high rank among the brahmins, householders, craftsmen, those engaged in studies, or meditators, up to whatever high rank they aspire to, should pay homage to him
the lord of nāgas, the lord of yakṣas, the lord of gandharvas
Once they have bathed and put on clean clothes, they should take refuge in the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha during the watch of dawn and pray to him, uttering these words
Even then, not one of them would understand the field of experience, practice, or liberation of a single once-returner
‘O Ākāśagarbha, your compassion is great indeed! I pray, please bestow good fortune upon me
the lord of asuras, the lord of garuḍas, the lord of kiṃnaras
Imagine that all sentient beings had become stream-enterers
sometimes in the form of a brahmin
However many immature, ordinary beings there may be, not one of them understands the field of experience, practice, or liberation of a stream-enterer
All of you will also acquire excellent qualities like his, and before long become vessels like him.
It is exactly as you say, holy being
He manifests in whatever form is required to tame beings
Sweep his path, adorn him with ornaments, and praise him in different ways
The Bhagavān now said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja, “What you say is well spoken, well spoken indeed
Honor, venerate, and revere him
and all the trees, made of seven precious materials
bore delicious fragrances, leaves, flowers, and fruits
He also caused all of the trees, grass, dry wood, and leaves, everything on the ground, to appear as if made of the seven precious materials
Moreover, he completely healed the diseases of the entire Sahā world
He pacified all the sufferings of hell beings, and of those abiding in the animal realms and in the world of Yama, the lord of death
These beings received food, drink, clothing, Dharma robes, and ornaments
“For some he emanates as a directly perceptible manifestation, for others he manifests in dreams
At that moment, the wishes of all beings in the realm of the Sahā world were completely fulfilled
They were possessed of good bodies, alluring beauty, sublime excellent complexions, and perfect limbs
The bright radiance of an illuminating orb of light, free of dust and dimness, made them even more beautiful
They were free of mental afflictions, their minds were very calm
inclined to every kind of virtue
and their faith in the Three Jewels deepened
Different kinds of melodious sounds also emanated from those jewels as a rain of a multitude of jewels showered down
The entire realm of the Sahā world was completely pervaded by that great light
He is endowed with the excellent qualities of a buddha
That is why a precious wish-fulfilling jewel appears on the head, the supreme part of the body of this son of noble family.
The Bhagavān replied
“It is thus, son of noble family. The sky is neither bound nor liberated
It is not afflicted, nor deluded, and is naturally pristine
The wind scatters particles of dust in the sky, and tosses them around. Thus, the sky appears impure, as dark as night
Then water makes the particles fall and renders the sky stainless and completely pristine
“Son of noble family, in the same way, mind—which is pervaded by emptiness, the ultimate reality of the tathāgata—is by nature utterly pristine and pure
However, the minds of sentient beings have been defiled by adventitiously arisen afflictions
For their benefit, the Dharma is taught out of the tathāgata’s great compassion, which is likened to water
When the assembly saw the grand display of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha
Sentient beings’ afflicted minds are completely purified, rendering them pristine and stainless
“How shall we arrange the seat of this holy being in the presence of the Bhagavān?
the entire gathering had the most wonderful and marvelous experiences. They wondered
At that very moment a lotus flower appeared in front of the Bhagavān. Made of precious substances, it had a stem of silver, leaves of gold
Because of this, when the sun of the tathāgata has risen, these beings will be filled with the light rays of primordial wisdom and will actualize the inconceivably excellent qualities of a buddha
“Thus they will be established in the four close applications of mindfulness and so on, up to the eighth branch of the eightfold noble path
They will achieve all possible qualities, up to the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha
All of these beings will be firmly rooted in compassion
From among them, arhats will appear in the world
No one who heard these sounds would ever turn away from attaining complete and perfect enlightenment
The grass, woods, leaves, flowers, fruit, and everything on the ground, too, emitted scintillating music of five qualities, even more beautiful than divine music, from which words of praise emerged
From these ornaments the sound of melodious songs of the five qualities, even more beautiful than divine music, also emerged
He also produced a manifestation that exquisitely decorated the sky above the Bhagavān’s head. Made of jewel filigrees and garlands of pearl jewelry, vast by some hundred yojanas, it resembled the great Brahmā’s parasol of divine precious jewels
they were playing pleasant music endowed with the five qualities, and were engaging in joyful play and entertainment
In those palaces, he manifested the lord of desire Kāmeśvara’s most sublime consort and her retinue
On both sides of the road, right and left, he produced manifestations of residences resembling the celestial palace of Indra and divine mansions made of the seven precious materials
a core of emerald, and flower anthers made of the light of Brahmā’s precious stone
Its width was about one krośa
Myriad kinds of lotus anther seats emerged in front and around it. On the lotus, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha appeared, sitting cross-legged
On his crown there was a precious jewel
Similarly, many myriads of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, servants of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha, appeared
Sitting on their respective lotus anther seats, they were absorbed in the meditative concentration of brave progression
Each was adorned with an Indranīla jewel. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja
“All bodhisattvas of great renown Respectfully pay homage First, when they arrive, And only then do they take their seats
When this great being arrived And made his grand displays
He appeared sitting on his seat Without having prostrated to the Buddha.
Since he does not dwell in discursive thought, We do not see him as a sentient being.
We do not see him as a sentient being. If that is so, to what purpose has he made this great display
One is not the other’s object
Bhagavān, all phenomena are to be understood in this particular way: they are devoid of concepts, they are empty, devoid of superimposition; they are the final reality and suchness
Bhagavān, with regard to the essence of space, it is thus. Its particular characteristic is that it is not differentiated; it is non-conceptual, completely non-conceptual, unmoving, and lacking in substance
They will be in a state of transgression and be deprived of the happiness of the higher realms and of liberation
rejoiced and praised the Bhagavān’s teachings
“Indeed, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha is endowed with the inconceivably excellent qualities of skillful means and wisdom
Having taken refuge in and seen these manifestations
these beings will obtain all forms of happiness, up to the happiness of abiding in the worlds of the higher realms. It is for this reason that no one can fathom the magnitude of all of the manifestations of Ākāśagarbha
and to bring about the wellbeing of sentient beings
‘Give heed, give heed to me, Ākāśagarbha of great renown, endowed with great compassion and intent on the welfare of beings
You, who are endowed with great compassion, look upon me
liberate me from these circumstances and bestow good fortune upon me
Both of these actions become root transgressions. This is the seventh root transgression
Uttering their names, they disparage, abuse, and speak badly of them
embraces the ten paths of unwholesome action and engages in them
Great bodhisattva mahāsattvas in numbers as limitless as the sands of the River Ganges
Thus, with the exception of the tathāgatas, all gods and humans, śrāvakas, and bodhisattvas
as well as the manifest forms of the great elements of earth, water, fire, and air—however many manifestations there were of the great elements
all without exception were obliterated, and only the precious jewel remained visible
Indeed, the sentient beings assembled there could not even see themselves, or each other
For them, all visible manifestations of the great elements also ceased and became imperceptible to the eye
They could not perceive their bodies, their features, or shape, nor did they have a sense of touch
because they realized that all phenomena are by nature endowed with final reality, suchness, and emptiness
Therefore, they were not at all frightened, afraid, or terrified
In that state, they asked questions such as “What is this?”, “How did this come about?”, and “What is the nature of this?”, but could find nothing
At that time, the great bodhisattva mahāsattva known as Great Nail of Brahmā bowed down toward the Bhagavān with folded hands and said
Yet ordinary beings conceptualize the form aggregate. Consequently, some of these people Develop doubts about the Buddha’s teaching
O Bhagavān, please give relief To the sentient beings who have come here
Bringing them to full maturation Is the heroes’ sphere of activity
Only then should they familiarize themselves with the idea that all phenomena are in essence inexpressible, non-arising, non-ceasing, not perceptible, and not in the slightest way existing
and henceforth not remain in either nihilism or eternalism
No sooner had the Bhagavān spoken than all those assembled in the retinue saw the manifestations in the same way they had previously seen, heard, understood, and known them
For those sentient beings who receive donations, he transforms into a container
for bodhisattvas, into a chariot
Using every mode of worship and respect, honor him as much as you can with jeweled umbrellas, victory banners, flags, flowers, incense, garlands, ointments, divine garments, ornaments, and vessels of many kinds
All in the assembly without exception then rose from their seats and turned towards where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha appeared
With overjoyed hearts, happily smiling faces, and eyes full of admiration, they stood with palms joined and gazed at him
the lord of mahoragas, and hermits in possession of the five kinds of supernatural knowledge
All of them were thinking the same thought
What kind of sublime display shall we prepare to honor him with
Next, he manifested precious jewels in the hands of all the beings gathered in this assembly
each jewel radiating its own light rays
Rains of various fine garments, of ornaments, of flowers, incense, garlands, parasols, vessels, and of fruit also showered down
He produced manifestations of divine garments, Dharma robes, golden threads, and pearl necklaces; of lotus flowers, utpala flowers, jasmine, and white lotuses; of uragasala trees, snake-heart sandalwood, tamāla tree leaves, and of white sandalwood powder scattered along the path
We see that this great being Dwells excellently in the Buddhadharma
Since he abides in final reality
I am afflicted by doubts: please explain further
Immature beings do not understand ultimate reality; Their experience is a complete mental construction
This is a hero’s method That brings these sentient beings to maturity
By means of ultimate reality Suffering beings will be completely freed
Bhaiṣajyarāja replied
Bodhisattva Maitreya asked
To this end, by means of relative truth, the skillful ones Manifest displays such as this one here
Similarly, once-returners would not understand non-returners, non-returners would not understand arhats, and arhats would not understand pratyekabuddhas
none of them would understand the field of experience of a single bodhisattva who has attained acceptance that phenomena are non-arising, nor his liberation, his analysis of ultimate reality, or his practice of bringing sentient beings to complete spiritual maturity
Imagine that all sentient beings had attained acceptance that phenomena are non-arising. Even so, not one of them would understand the field of experience of a single bodhisattva who has realized discriminating awareness and attained the meditative concentration of brave progression; nor would they fathom his aspirations, or the transformative power of his investigating ultimate reality
An uncountable number of eons ago, this son of noble family, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha, attained acceptance that phenomena are non-arising, attained discriminating awareness, and attained the meditative concentration of brave progression
Since even bodhisattvas dwelling on the grounds up to the eighth ground may become defiled
they themselves do not have the capacity to display such a field of experience and the distinguishing qualities of his practice
This son of noble family examines their mentalities and latent tendencies, how they are influenced by afflicted views, and how they generated roots of merit in the past, an
he understands how their minds have to be trained
He teaches them how to generate roots of virtue toward the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha, or else the meritorious character of the essence of giving, of ethical discipline, or meditation, whichever might be appropriate
It is certain that their actions of body, speech, and mind will become upright
their aspirations will become honest, and they will follow an honest spiritual friend
wholeheartedly recite the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha in order to pacify their diseases and reach a state free of ills, an
and if they burn aloe wood and Chinese incense and prostrate to the holy being Ākāśagarbha
then that son of noble family will appear in their dreams in front of them in the guise of a brahmin, Śakra, Śrī, Sarasvatī, a king, minister, hero, doctor, father, mother, boy, or girl
desire to abide firmly in meditative concentration, gain wisdom, be famous, or learn crafts
those who desire power, a good body, wealth, saintliness, a high caste, a son, or a servant
or giving, ethical discipline, and the other perfections up to wisdom
those who desire soft-spoken words, to be in harmony with other beings, liberation from negativity, or to bring others to the practice of all of the perfections from giving to wisdom
those who desire a long life, or to have property and never lack it
and those who wish to cause the stingy to be generous, the immoral to be ethical, or the lazy to be diligent
tadyathā | sumriśa | sumriśa | kāruṇika | caracara | vicara | saṃcara | kāruṇika | murmur | vegadhari | maca me | bhujapāda | mahā­kāruṇikā | cinata­maṇi pūrāya | kāruṇika | sarva śamesthapāya | ajñādhāri | sphu guṅ sphu guṅ | ruti viveka guṅ driṣṭi viveka guṅ | pūraya kāruṇika | pūrāyantu mama | aśa sarva antha ca | aśokagati svāhā 
The son of noble family will appear to them in the form of a human being, a wild animal, a bird, in his own form, or as a body that corresponds to their fortune of merit
Whether they do not follow any path, or practice the śrāvaka path, or the pratyekabuddha’s path
in a single brief instant of wisdom and with just a minimum of skillful means he has the power to place them irrevocably on the unsurpassable Mahāyāna path
thereby establishing them in meditative concentration, in the dhāraṇīs, in the various states of tolerance, and up to the tenth ground
This shows that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha is endowed with inconceivable methods, primordial wisdom, and great compassion
Son of noble family, some people can comprehend the extent of space, but no-one can comprehend the extent of this noble son’s methods and primordial wisdom, of his great love and great compassion, the extent to which he has developed the strength of meditative concentration and brings beings to complete maturation
Son of noble family, beings who are without deceit, without pretense, are diligent, endowed with honest views
He teaches them skillful means, primordial wisdom, vigor, and how to maintain determination
These means, wisdom, vigor, and determination liberate beings from their sufferings and cause them to generate a mind that strives for unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
Their energy, vigor, and great determination will become the great enthusiasm and determination needed to bring the six perfections to complete perfection
They will swiftly awaken entirely and perfectly to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
Thus, for all beings who have committed a root transgression, who are bound for the lower realms, who have exhausted all roots of virtue
for all these frightened beings, this son of noble family is medicine
who are malevolent, who conceal their faults, whose minds are disturbed by miserliness
They are in a state of transgression and will be deprived of any happiness of the god and human realms
Yet this son of noble family brings about these beings’ fulfillment with the bliss of the higher realms and liberation. What are these particular transgressions
Son of noble family, for a kṣatriya on whom royal authority has been bestowed
stealing from a place of worship
stealing that which has been offered to the local saṅgha or the saṅgha of the four directions, o
inciting someone to steal it
or the instructions on the Mahāyāna definite deliverance
Taking by force the saffron robes of those who have shaved their heads and beards for my sake and donned the saffron robes—whether they uphold the precepts or not, whether they observe the discipline or not—thus making them householders
inflicting corporal punishment on them, imprisoning or killing them
all of these constitute the third root transgression
Furthermore, if a kṣatriya advocates the philosophy of the non-existence of causality
denies the existence of future lives
and also influences many other people to follow the ten paths of unwholesome action, manipulates them, encourages them and brings them to do so
these actions constitute the fifth root transgression
He will explain and teach the hitherto unheard of, the unprecedented, the instructions of the omniscient one, the deep and profound sūtras, the dhāraṇīs, tolerance, and the grounds
And for this reason the kṣatriyas on whom royal authority has been bestowed will be caused to develop shame about their previous negative and unwholesome actions
Furthermore, for a minister, forcing somebody to give up the Dharma, whether this entails the instructions on the śrāvakas’ definitive deliverance, the instructions on the pratyekabuddhas’ definite deliverance, or the instructions on the definite deliverance of the omniscient one, as well as creating obstacles for the teachings or concealing them: these constitute the third root transgression
Furthermore, for a minister, harming those who have taken ordination with the Bhagavān
whether they uphold the precepts or not
whether they observe the discipline or not
taking by force their saffron robes and making them householders
imprisoning them or taking their lives
these all constitute the fourth root transgression
Such a minister will be deprived of any happiness of the god and human realms, and will descend to the hell realms
Then, for the sake of such a person, the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will be born, live, and teach in the land of the uncivilized or another place
Irrespective of where and in which guise he has manifested, he will explain the Dharma to those ministers
He will explain and teach the hitherto unheard of, the unprecedented, the instructions of the omniscient one, the deep and profound sūtras, the dhāraṇīs, tolerance, and the grounds
Then those ministers will be made to develop shame about their previous unwholesome negative actions
They will reprimand themselves and disclose, give up, and relinquish negative actions
And they will eagerly practice giving, discipline, and having determination for the vows; and they will reach the higher realms
when my śrāvakas commit any of these root transgressions
According to how it has always been explained
the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha will manifest birth in different places for the benefit of those beings
There are beings who were born in this worldly realm of afflictions and five impurities because they conducted themselves in evil ways in the past
They rely upon a spiritual friend and listen to the most profound Mahāyāna owing to the tiny root of virtue they possess
Though they do so with little understanding, those sons of noble family give birth to the aspiration to unsurpassable, perfectly complete enlightenment
they should burn aloe wood and Chinese or other incense, join their palms, and utter the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha at the break of dawn
uttering these words
Aruṇa, Aruṇa, endowed with great compassion
Then even the tiniest unwholesome deeds you have committed with your body, speech, and mind due to the afflictions will be purified, and they will not come to maturation
Saying these words is the third root transgression for beginner bodhisattvas
Thus you will not go to the lower realms, you will not enter any path leading to the lower realms
thinking one thing but professing another
They may also propagate and versify the Mahāyāna teachings, and for the purpose of gain and honor they may chant those verses, recite, memorize, read, and explain them
and even teach others things that they have merely heard, saying, ‘I am a follower of the Mahāyāna; others, however, are not.
Because they seek gain and honor, they act jealously and become upset when others are appreciated and respected
praising themselves instead. Out of jealousy, they say, ‘I possess supreme qualities
This action constitutes a transgression and deprives them of the happiness of the Mahāyāna
It is therefore considered a very serious transgression that leads to rebirth in the lower realms
Furthermore, son of noble family, in the future there will be beginner bodhisattvas, householders or ordained
who will read, recite, and chant sūtras that contain profound emptiness. These Mahāyāna sūtras are the object of understanding of bodhisattvas who need only little effort, and who are greatly intelligent beings, adorned with dhāraṇīs, tolerance, meditative concentration, and the grounds
Having recited them, they extensively teach these sūtras to others
you too will come to behold primordial wisdom, just as I do now
they promote themselves for the purpose of gain and honor
Instead of stating, ‘I have not actualized this most profound Dharma, but teach it by merely reading it out,
The analogy here is that of someone who travels out into the great secluded wilderness, where he suffers hunger, thirst, and exhaustion
He then approaches a tree, intending to eat of the great fruit it bears
However, ignoring the tree with its fine aroma and delicious fruit
he climbs instead a poisonous tree bearing fruit devoid of taste, and eats its poisonous fruit
Therefore, if beginner bodhisattvas who have gained this hard-to-achieve human birth live with a spiritual friend and wish to enter the Mahāyāna, ye
praise themselves and disparage others for the purpose of gain, honor, and fame
they incur a serious transgression
Because of this root transgression, all the wise ones will strongly criticize them and they will go to the lower realms
Seeming to engage in many meritorious deeds of giving
they will become proud and haughty due to their giving. Out of arrogance and pride, they will cause division within the kṣatriyas
Backed by the kṣatriyas, they may even punish the monastics, robbing them by imposing fines
Thus, being wronged, those monastics will steal from whichever individual, local saṅgha, saṅgha of the four directions, and whichever place of worship they can, and give what they have robbed to pay their fine
They do not observe the precepts of the sūtras and the vinaya
nor do they observe the black teachings, nor the great teachings
Having abandoned their training in loving kindness, great compassion, and the perfection of wisdom, as well as their training in skillful means and the trainings taught in other sūtras
The bhikṣu meditators have become vessels for meditative concentration, dhāraṇīs, tolerance, and the grounds
They have become holy beings worthy of receiving offerings; they have become sacred vessels
They illuminate the world and show the way
liberating beings from the realm of karma and afflictions and placing them on the path leading beyond sorrow
They have incurred a transgression, will be deprived of the happiness of the higher realms and of liberation
they organize duties for the monastic community that are dissociated from such meritorious activities in order to harm the bhikṣus
they wish to disclose their root transgressions
pay homage to the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, and call out his name, then
son of noble family, in accordance with their merit, he will stand before those sentient beings as an ordinary person
or in front of those beginner bodhisattvas in various forms, from that of a brahmin to that of a girl
and make them disclose those transgressions just as they have occurred
venerate him, revere him deeply, and worship and honor him in numerous ways with flowers, incense, garlands, ointments, parasols, banners of victory, and flags
if they pay homage to him and even offer their lives to him
then those beings will not die in fire or in water
They will not die an untimely death, become sick, or die of hunger or thirst, nor will they be killed by order of a ruler
and for the rest of their lives they will not incur a single transgression
they will not see forms with their eyes
To those who revere Kāmeśvara, he will display the form of Kāmeśvara
To those who have taken refuge in and revere Nārāyaṇa, Śakra, a cakravartin, the sun, the moon, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virupākṣa, or Vaiśravaṇa, or who have taken refuge in various objects such as devas, mountains, trees, fountains, ponds, and pools, he will show himself accordingly
And in the form that corresponds to their disposition he will speak the following words
At this time, these beings will be joyful and delighted by the sound (of those words) that bring the Buddha to mind. Then they will die and be reborn in a buddhafield, unsullied and pure, in which a buddha bhagavān dwells, lives, and resides, and where he teaches the Dharma
umuraṇakhe | bakṣamanile | samudra | avadarena | nayanaya | mahā­kāruṇikā | anupama­jambha­smṛti | akra­jambha­smṛti | vajra­jambha­smṛti| koṣa­smṛti | anupama­smṛti | bhūtakoṭi­smṛti svāhā 
To those who recite in this way, Ākāśagarbha grants mindfulness and entrance into meditative concentration
Those who desire to study treatises, whether the words of the Buddha or expositions by the śrāvakas
Give heed, give heed to me
Greatly learned one, among all beings, Ākāśagarbha, son of noble family beyond imagination, you are supreme
inīlaja | viṣanaduṣaja | viyavanaja | vibakṣisame | pāśalajasi | sthānaśarave | śastrakarṇṇe | humahuma | mahā­kāruṇika svāhā 
or face hostile people
those who are afraid of fire, water, weapons, toxins, curses, tigers, lions, strong poisons, thieves, and rogues
and those who are bereft of monastic robes, alms, bedding, a seat, medicine to cure disease, or of basic necessities
such beings may call out the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha
Relying upon you, I will attain peace and happiness in this and future lives
Some princes may wish to be promoted to a higher rank
They might utter the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha and pay homage to him, worship and venerate him, and so forth
Fulfill my aspirations and intentions, each one of them, according to my wishes
You, who are endowed with great compassion, grant me whatever I wish, and kindly do whatever I request
Son of noble family, some may be able to estimate how many drops of water are contained in the great ocean
but no one can fathom the extent to which the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha is gifted in skillful means and wisdom, or the extent of his activities that ripen sentient beings through skillful means
Son of noble family, some may be able to apprehend the expanse of the whole of the infinite, limitless space in the ten directions, bu
it is impossible to fathom the multitude of forms the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha takes in order to bring sentient beings to spiritual maturity
Among those born in the animal realm he manifests in the form of an animal
among hell beings, in the form of a hell being; an
for those of the Yama world, as a being of the Yama world, and so forth
in order to eliminate the karma of their negative deeds, to liberate them from the lower realms, to place them in the higher realms
he manifests in various forms at the time of death and transference, at the last movement of consciousness
The entire assembly was amazed and marveled at the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha
Having paid homage to their teacher and honored him, they all joined their palms and made offerings to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha, and honored him in various ways
They made offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, ointments, lamps, parasols, victory banners, flags, monastic robes, ornaments, garments, praises, songs, and cymbal music
The bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha in turn presented the Bhagavān with all of these offerings
then prostrated at the feet of the Bhagavān and supplicated him with these words
Venerable Bhagavān, in this afflicted buddhafield stained by the five impurities
beings are deluded due to the great darkness of ignorance. How can those beings be benefited, so as to bring about their enlightenment
In this case, if the stars, the planets, the sun, and the moon are not visible
then the seconds, minutes, hours, days, nights, seasons, and years will be imperceptible as well
Pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattva mahāsattvas will appear in the world
Tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddhas will appear in the world
Son of noble family, what do you think: does space abide in the eye
It is devoid of sprout, seed, fruit, and ripening
devoid of words, and of mental fixation
Bhagavān, it does not
Does it abide in the eye consciousness
Does it abide in that which is apprehended by the eye
Does space abide anywhere inside, in the arising of the three feelings caused by the eye apprehending an object
The same is to be said about the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the body as well
Son of noble family, what do you think
does space abide in the eye
does space abide in the mind, or anywhere else up to the arising of the three feelings caused by the mind apprehending an object
do sentient beings abide in space
does space abide in sentient beings
Thus did the bodhisattva mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha reply to the Bhagavan’s questions
vyava­rāja | mantakṣāya | jinajaya | jananimamunihara | anayaphala | guṇa­garbha | niyamasurināya | bupaśa | śataśapa | śamaśana | tathakama | śamaṅgu | mātuśiṣa | śama­cetanāya | kleṣāntasaṃśoṣaṇe svāhā 
Well said, well said
at the last moment of beings’ consciousness, you will have the capacity to eliminate their obscuration of afflictions, their obscuration of karma, and their obscuration with regard to phenomena, and send them to the completely pure buddhafields
You will go to limitless, uncountable world systems, an
by the power of compassion for sentient beings you will expound various classes of Mahāyāna sūtras in the villages, towns, market places, provinces, countries, and kings’ palaces, manifesting in various forms with appropriate attire and conduct
As the Bhagavān was teaching, limitless, countless beings of nine types of birth among gods and men attained various states of meditative concentration, dhāraṇīs and tolerance
When beings give up the very basis Of their conflicts, whatever they may be
The very basis of all their views Will quickly change

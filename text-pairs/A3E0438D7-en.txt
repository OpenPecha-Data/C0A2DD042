Acala Sādhana
From the state of emptiness, upon a sun and moon and the four māras,
Appears Acala the guardian, dark blue and wrathful in form.
His right hand holds a sword and the left a lasso.
He has all the charnel ground accoutrements and stands with left knee genuflected.
In the midst of a blazing mass of wisdom fire
He conveys the nine moods of dance, and at his heart upon a sun
Is the syllable Hūṃ surrounded by the rotating mantra garland,
From which light radiates out to carry out activity and collect blessings and accomplishment.
oṃ caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hūṃ phaṭ

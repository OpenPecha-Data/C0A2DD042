Brief Windhorse Practice of Tārā
Through the blessing and power of the unfailing Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and of Jetsünma,
Mother of the buddhas, Noble Tārā,
May our lifespan, merit, prosperity and renown
Increase like a waxing moon, like a rising summer lake.
Especially may our good fortune, wangtang and windhorse
Be healed when they weaken, rejoined when interrupted, raised up when sinking down;
May whatever we do turn out well,
And may long life, good health, peace and happiness be ours!

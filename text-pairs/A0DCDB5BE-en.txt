Prayer for the Long Life of Lodi Gyari Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
Through the blessings of the deathless deities of the three roots and all the deities of long-life,
May the life of Lodrö Gyaltsen, the magical emanation of Khenchen Phende Özer,
Remain secure until the very end of time,
And may his activity spread far and wide, bringing universal benefit to the teachings and beings.

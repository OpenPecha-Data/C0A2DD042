Essence of Accomplishment An Extremely Concise Feast-Offering to Noble Tārā
Namo guru ārya-tārāyai
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ
Fire, wind and water—the display of awareness—
Burn, scatter and wash away reification of the feast substances.
Within a skull-cup, the amṛta nectar transforms
Into an ocean of sensual delights:
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Hrīḥ! From the dharmadhātu palace of Akaniṣṭha,
From the saṃbhogakāya field Array of Supreme Activity,
And from the nirmāṇakāya-maṇḍala of the three places, 1
Samaya Tārā Yoginī,
Together with an ocean of deities of the three roots,
We invite you, please come and join this feast-gathering.
We offer you this delightful wisdom amṛta,
Lavish and replete.
We openly admit and confess our misdeeds, obscurations, faults and downfalls.
Liberate all dualistic thoughts into the expanse of reality!
Bestow the supreme and common activities and siddhis!
oṃ guru ārya-tārā-sarva-saparivāra-gaṇacakra-pūjā hoḥ

Pheṃ ! Hosts of arrogant sprits roaming outside this maṇḍala,
In accord with your previously taken samayas,
Accept and enjoy this remainder offering.
oṃ ucchiṣṭa-baliṅta khāhi
Through this marvellous offering
To the assembly of the Noble Lady,
Having completed the accumulations of merit and wisdom
May we swiftly attain the two accomplishments.

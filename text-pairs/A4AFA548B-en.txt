A Brief Prayer for Summoning Prosperity
Hūṃ! By the power of mantras and mudrās of the Three Jewels and Three Roots,
May all the good omens, abundance and prosperity of the animate and inanimate universe, both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Be summoned and gathered here, and expand without ever declining,
So that the splendour of happiness, well-being, auspiciousness and all that is good may blaze forth!

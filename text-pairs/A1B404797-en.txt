A Prayer to Dudjom Lingpa
You are the regent of Orgyen, an emanated tamer of beings,
Who actualized the dharmakāya that is present as the ground
And, within the space of awareness, gained vast assurance that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are the display of purity and equalness —
Dudjom Dorje, at your feet I pray!

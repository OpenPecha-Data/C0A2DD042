The Moonlight of Auspiciousness Prayer for the Swift Return of the Supreme Tulku
Oṃ svasti!
Master of speech, treasure delighting Mañjunātha,
Bearer of oceanic insights into sūtra and mantra,
Whose activity to benefit others is unbounded—
Glorious guru, at your feet I pray.
Although you have entered the ultimate dharma-sphere, 1
Do not give up your compassionate concern for the teachings and beings,
But in order to illuminate the tradition of Tsechen [Kunga] Nyingpo,
Swiftly arise once again in supreme nirmāṇakāya form.
Banishing the ills of fivefold degeneration among teachings and beings,
Blossoming with youthful intelligence, kindness and enlightened potential,
And abiding by the conduct that delights the victorious ones—
May such a supreme and noble tulku shine forth, I pray.
Then may you may triumph in the battle with obstructive demons,
Live long with indestructible vitality, 2
And acquire infinite qualities of learning, contemplation and meditation—
May all be auspicious so that this may effortlessly come to pass.

A Very Brief Prayer for Clearing Obstacles from the Path (Barché Lamsel)
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ! Dharmakāya Amitābha, saṃbhogakāya Avalokiteśvara,
Nirmāṇakāya Padmasambhava—the wrathful Drakpo Tsal,
We pray to you; with the force of your compassion
Dissolve all obstacles, outer, inner and secret, into space!
When beings suffer in this decadent dark age,
We have no other hope but you! From the depth of our hearts
With fervent devotion and longing, urgently we pray:
Avert bad circumstances, outer, inner and secret obstacles,
Let our lifespan and merit increase, and our lungta strengthen and grow!

Sweet Song of Vajra Immortality: A Prayer for Long Life
Through the power and blessings of the deathless life and wisdom
Of an ocean of deathless sources of refuge throughout space and time,
Illusory dance-like manifestations of deathless vajra wisdom,
May these deathless vajra words of truth be accomplished.
The wise knowledge and love of all the Victorious Ones and their heirs,
Including Mañjughoṣa, vital force of the Sage’s nonsectarian teachings,
Magnificent champion of the Dharma, which is so profound and vast,
With your activity as far-reaching as the ocean, may your life be long.
May all your qualities of study, contemplation and meditation be perfected,
May you uphold, preserve and propagate Buddha’s teachings in their entirety,
May you fulfil the wishes of infinite disciples in accordance with the Dharma,
And may you remain forever, an ornament enhancing the beauty of the world.

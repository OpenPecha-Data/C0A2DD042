The Yearning Song that Swiftly Inspires Compassion A Prayer to the Vajradhara Gurus, the Gentle Protectors
Padmasambhava, who attained the deathless wisdom kāya,
Appearing once again here and now to illuminate the great secret
Vajra vehicle and help it to flourish throughout the whole of space and time,
Supreme glorious guru, endowed with the five wisdoms,
Personification of the vajra body, speech and mind,
Remain for a hundred aeons, and for the sake of us all,
Turn uninterruptedly the Dharma Wheel of the indestructible nāda,
Thereby planting the seeds of the four kāyas, I pray.
Utterly pacify any outer and inner obstacles, and
Make everything auspicious, so that positive, harmonious circumstances
Never wane but continually increase just like a lake in summer.
For me and all sentient beings, as infinite as space,
From now until we attain awakening,
Glorious guru Khyentse Wangpo,
Guide us without ever parting and grant us blessings and attainments.

Calling the Guru from Afar
Essence and embodiment of all the buddhas of the three times,
You are indivisible from Guru Padmasambhava,
And have come in accordance with the intent of Trisong Detsen—
Omniscient vidyādhara, King of Dharma,
Rangjung Dorje—‘Self-Arisen Vajra’—Jigme Lingpa, know me, care for me!
You are a treasury of the Buddha’s Words, the treasure revelations, and pith instructions,
The crown ornament of the vidyādharas of the Early Translations School,
And elder brother to hundreds of thousands of ḍākinīs—
Khyentse Özer—‘Rays of Wisdom and Love’—know me, care for me!
Pioneer of the supreme vehicle, the vajra pinnacle, 1
Sovereign of the heroic Lord of Secrets’ heart-sons,
Jampal Chökyi Shenyen—‘Mañjuśrī, Spiritual Friend’—know me, care for me!
King of all treasure revealers and accomplished adepts,
Sole refuge of the teachings and all beings in this degenerate age,
Treasurer of the profound and secret Heart Essence,
Pema Wangchen Rolpa Tsal—‘Mighty Lotus, Powerful Display’—know me, care for me!
You were cared for by the learned and accomplished Longchen Rabjam,
Perfected the two types of bodhicitta in your mind-stream,
And realized appearance and existence to be luminous dharmakāya—
Gyalwé Nyugu Khyentse Lha—‘Fresh Shoot of the Victorious Ones, Deity of Wisdom and Love’—know me, care for me!
With your compassion, look upon me
Day and night, throughout the six times.
Having pacified and naturally liberated
Outer, inner and secret obstacles,
For the remainder of my life,
May my altruistic wish to spread the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha
Only strengthen and increase!
The ripening and liberating spiritual instructions of the kama and terma ,
And especially the teachings of the Heart Essence,
Have come to resemble a mere painted candle.
Grant us now the power and accomplishments
To make them shine ever more brightly!
Bless us with the ability to empty saṃsāra from its very depths!

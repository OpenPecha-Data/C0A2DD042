A Brief Visualization and Recitation of the Great Mother Prajñāpāramitā
Āḥ. All that appears and exists is an immense pure realm,
In the centre of which, upon a lotus and moon,
Is the Great Mother Prajñāpāramitā, gold in colour,
With one face and four hands—with which she holds
A vajra in the first right hand and a book in the first left,
While the remaining two rest in the gesture of equanimity.
She is adorned with the silk and jewel ornaments
And sits with legs crossed in the vajra posture.
Her three centres are marked with the three syllables
And in her heart centre, upon a lotus and moon is an Āḥ,
Surrounded by the rotating mantra garland,
From which light radiates out to accomplish twofold benefit.
tadyathā | oṃ gate gate pāragate | pārasaṃgate | bodhi svāhā
The deity appearance dissolves and I rest in a state of clear light.

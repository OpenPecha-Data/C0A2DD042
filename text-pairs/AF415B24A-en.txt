Prayer for the Long Life of Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
Through the power and blessings of the infinite victorious ones and deities of the three roots,
May the life of this supreme guide, Shedrup Nyinjé, be forever firm,
May his glorious activity for the Buddhadharma in general and the tradition of Ewam Chogar in particular,
Spread far and wide, bringing the most excellent benefit to all!

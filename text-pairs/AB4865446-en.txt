Prayer to the Omniscient Longchen Rabjam
Just like the Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones who beautify our world,
You were their equal in your mastery of compassion, learning and realization,
Yet you practised hidden in the forest in sacred solitude.
Longchenpa, who perfected saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the state of dharmakāya,
Drimé Özer—Stainless Light—at your feet I pray:
Grant your blessing so I may realize the natural state, the true nature of mind! 1

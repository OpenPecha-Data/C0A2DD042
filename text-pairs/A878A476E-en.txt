Luminous Clouds of Spontaneous Song A Prayer to Call the Guru from Afar
Original simplicity, naturally occurring, uncompounded,
Profound luminosity and peace, the youthful vase body’s expanse—
Watch over me, dharmakāya guru, whose inner brilliance never wavers!
Bless me to reach the exhaustion within dharmatā! 1
Your expressive play, natural luminosity unceasing, is spontaneously present
As an ocean of kāyas, wisdoms, and pure realms—
Watch over me, samboghakāya guru of perfect enjoyment!
Bless me to reach the fullness of awareness and space!
As the expression of all-pervasive capacity, dance of the magical net,
You frolic endlessly in the varied realms of disciples to be tamed.
Watch over me, Uḍḍiyāna, supreme nirmāṇakāya!
Bless me, that the visionary experience of luminosity may unfold!
Root guru, the single face and embodiment of all the Victors,
May my devotion allow me to see you as the dharmakāya buddha,
So that the blessings of the Wisdom Lineage seep into my heart,
And I may see directly the radiance of awareness—dharmatā!
May I realize the view of stainless, naturally occurring awareness,
And bring to fullness the meditation that transcends addition or removal.
Through the supreme conduct free from acceptance and rejection, application and exertion,
May I seize the everlasting realm that equally suffuses saṃsāra and nirvāṇa!
Through the direct path of Crossing Over 2 to luminosity in particular,
May the visionary path of the three kāyas be instantly perfected!
With the rainbow body of great transference, the wisdom vajra,
May I dredge from its depths the saṃsāra of others’ perceptions!
In short, may the peerless lord of the family, my glorious Lord Guru,
Look after me without a moment’s separation,
From now until I attain awakening!
Bless me, that the twofold benefit may be accomplished just as I wish!

Padma’s Melodious Song A Prayer for the Long Life of the Fourth in the Succession of Lotus-Tongued Jamchen Tai Situ Incarnations
Oṃ svasti!
Through invoking the compassion, power and truth
Of all the gurus and oceanic Three Roots
Throughout the infinite realms of the ten directions,
May a flowery rain of wondrous auspiciousness descend!
Great leader among those who uphold the Karmapas’ teachings,
The great Maitreya in person, emanation of Pema Wangchen,
Nirmāṇakāya who is meaningful to behold,
May you live long like a mighty sun, I pray.
May your liberating qualities of learning, ethics and kindness fully mature,
So that you become the foremost of all adepts of definitive meaning.
A great lion among those who explain the profound meaning of sūtra and mantra—
May your lotus feet remain steadfast for a hundred aeons, I pray.
May you be victorious in the battle with demonic forces and obstacles, outer and inner,
May your deathless longevity and strength of wisdom bloom,
May you gain control of the marks of virtue in existence and quiescence,
And may you effortlessly and spontaneously accomplish your own and others’ aims!

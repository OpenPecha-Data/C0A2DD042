Accomplishing the Lama through the Seven-Line Prayer A Special Teaching from the Lama Sangdü
Hūṃ! In the north-west of the land of Oḍḍiyāna
In the heart of a lotus flower,
Endowed with the most marvellous attainments,
You are renowned as the ‘Lotus-born’,
Surrounded by many hosts of ḍākinīs.
Following in your footsteps,
I pray to you: Come, inspire me with your blessing!

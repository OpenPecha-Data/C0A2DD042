A Prayer to Khandro Yeshé Tsogyal
Samantabhadrī, the dharmadhātu mother of all buddhas,
Supremely kind, sole mother who protects the Tibetan people,
Chief ḍākinī of great bliss, you bestow the supreme siddhi,
Yeshé Tsogyal, to you I pray.
Grant your blessing so that all outer, inner, and secret obstacles may be pacified.
Grant your blessing so that the gurus may live long.
Grant your blessing so that this era’s disease, famine and warfare may be pacified.
Grant your blessing so that evil sorcery and spells may be overcome.
Grant your blessing so that my lifespan, glory and wisdom may increase.
Grant your blessing so that all my wishes may be spontaneously fulfilled.

A Prayer to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
Single embodiment of the wisdom, love and spiritual power
Of all the victorious ones and their heirs, Mañjughoṣa and the rest,
Glorious guru, lord among learned and accomplished masters —
To you I pray: look on me with eyes of compassion!
Pacify the sufferings of this life, the next and the bardo state.
Increase longevity, merit, prosperity, favourable circumstances and everything positive.
Inspire all beings with whom I am connected with your blessings
So that they may attain ultimate enlightenment in Sukhāvatī.

The Healing Medicine of Faith A Prayer to the Lineage of the Sādhana of Peaceful Mañjuśrī
In the dharmakāya realm, the infinite dharmadhātu,
You seized the primordial stronghold with its six special features: 1
Mañjuśrī Samantabhadra, to you I pray:
Inspire me to realize primordial purity!
In the sambhogakāya realm, self-manifest and utterly pure,
You are perfect in your symbolic form with fivefold certainty: 2
Mañjuśrī Vajradhara, to you I pray:
Inspire me to reach the culmination of the four visions!
In the nirmāṇakāya realm for taming beings in unpredictable ways,
You display all manner of emanations to guide others as appropriate:
Mañjuśrī, wisdom being, to you I pray:
Inspire me to accomplish great benefit for the teachings and beings!
In the realm of the Five-Peaked Mountain, the great sacred place,
The blessings of Mañjuśrī’s wisdom matured in your mind,
Jigme Puntsok, at your feet I pray:
Inspire me with the realization of the mind-transmission lineage!
To all the root and lineage masters, the yidam deities,
Ḍākinīs and oath-bound guardians, I pray:
Inspire me to receive your blessings and the supreme attainment,
And to accomplish enlightened activity and pacify all obstacles!
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
In this life, may every excellence, both spiritual and temporal, increase;
And, in future, may we all gain realization in the very same gathering,
Inseparable from the illusory form of the supreme guide and guru.

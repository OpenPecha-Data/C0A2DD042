Melody to Delight Padma A Long-Life Prayer and Name Offering for the Rebirth of Chokgyur Lingpa
Oṃ svasti.
The emanation of Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa, changeless Padmākara,
Who is the single embodiment of all the victors’ knowledge and love,
Was Ngedön Drubpé Dorje, whose blessings have now reappeared
In this form as a new-moon-like emanation.
I pray that you fully develop the physical strength of threefold training
As a virtuous guide upholding the teachings of the supreme vehicle,
And through an incomparable life of liberation as a scholar and adept,
Cause the teachings of the Sage to flourish in a hundred directions.
May all the hostile, malevolent jungpo demons
Succumb to glorious Vajrakumāra’s might and power
So not even their names remain. And at the very same time
May you fully develop your potential for enlightened action.
May Amitāyus, Tāra 'Wish-Fulfilling Wheel',
Uṣṇīṣavijayā, Lake-Born Vajra and all the rest,
Infinite oceans of long-life deities, grant their blessings,
So that your life may never wane but long remain secure.

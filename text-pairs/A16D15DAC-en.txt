A Concise Meditation and Mantra Recitation of Sarasvatī from the Heart-Essence of the Ḍākinī of Suchness (Chönyi Khandrö Tuktik)
Namo. I, along with all beings of the six realms,
Take refuge in you, Sarasvatī,
Embodiment of the Three Jewels—
Pray keep us from the fears of the lower realms!
Ho. For the sake of all beings, who have each had the experience of being a parent to me—
I generate the aspiration of bodhicitta
And pledge to engage and accomplish
The practice of the six perfect actions.
Hrīḥ. Instantaneously I arise as Sarasvatī,
Translucent white, peaceful and radiant as she smiles, adorned with the major and minor marks of perfection.
She has one face and two hands that play a sitar.
Silken tassels hang from her jewel tiara.
She sits on lotus and moon disk with her ankles crossed and knees drawn up.
The three places of her body are each marked with a syllable,
From which light radiates to the myriad buddha-fields of the three kāyas
And invites the awakened in the aspect of Sarasvatī.
The invoked wisdom merges with and becomes of one taste with me, the visualized deity;
Awareness–emptiness, beyond all expression—behold the real face of the goddess.
Within unimpeded emptiness-luminosity, I recite the mantra:
Oṃ hrīṃ devi prajñā vārdhani ye svāhā
Hūṃ. Autumn’s full moon cannot eclipse your beauty,
You hold wisdom’s dhāraṇī and speak with confidence and eloquence,
All qualities are perfected in you—for your mind is the very treasury of love and wisdom.
Sarasvatī, I praise your body, speech and mind.
Through this merit may all beings
Come to enjoy the highest, Akaniṣṭha, pure realm.

An Aspiration Prayer
By the force of the truth of the precious Three Jewels,
Throughout the succession of all my lives to come,
In whatever place that I may reside,
May the teachings of the Buddha flourish and spread!
May all sentient beings enjoy happiness and fulfillment!
May they always engage in the practice of the holy Dharma!
May the two aims be spontaneously fulfilled and may we realize the two kāyas!
May the teachings of the barbaric māras disappear!
Through the blazing splendor of the Great Orgyen's activity,
May the study and practice of Dharma spread far and wide!

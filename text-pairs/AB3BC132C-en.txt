Guru Yoga of Jamyang Loter Wangpo
Above my head upon a lotus and moon
Is Jamyang Loter Wangpo,
White with a reddish glow and stout in figure.
His two hands hold a book and rosary.
He wears the three dharma robes and paṇḍita hat.
Light rays emerge from the three syllables at this three centres,
To invite the Three Jewels, who dissolve into him inseparably.
So that he becomes the embodiment of all sources of refuge.
I accumulate merit through the seven-branch practice
And I recite as many prayers to you, the guru, as I can.
At your heart is the vital syllable Dhīḥ, surrounded by the mantra,
From which light radiates, swiftly accomplishing twofold benefit.
Oṃ āḥ guru mañjughoṣa dhīḥ nidhindraya hūṃ
From the three syllables at the guru’s three centres
Rays of light—white, red and blue—emerge one by one,
Then all together, and dissolve into my own three centres.
I receive the four empowerments, purify the four obscurations,
And the seeds of the four kāyas are implanted in my mindstream.
Then, through the force of my prayers,
Enters my head at the aperture of Brahma,
And takes his place on the open lotus of my heart.
There are waters of oceanic learning that gather and swirl, 1
Flowers of virtue and clouds of the incense of ethical conduct,
There are lamps of wisdom and a lake that is perfumed with faith.
There is the sublime sustenance of samādhi’s elixir,
And music that resounds in melodious songs of praise.
There are parasols of benevolence, pennants of discernment,
And victory banners raised aloft in courageous eloquence.
This celestial mansion of my body, so beautifully adorned
I offer to the Lord of Dharma who resides forever
On the full moon and blossoming lotus of my heart.
With a mind of certain aspiration, I pray to you:
Master to all beings, may you always be pleased!

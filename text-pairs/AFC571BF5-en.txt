Verses in Praise of the Protector Akṣobhya
Homage to the Deity!
Guru of beings, Bhagavān Akṣobhya,
You perfected the aspiration to guide beings with great compassion,
And attained supreme enlightenment—
Guardian and protector of beings, to you I offer homage!
Upon a throne supported by elephants and a lotus and sun-disc,
You sit with a body the color of lapis lazuli, adorned with marks and signs.
Your legs are crossed, and hands are poised in the earth-touching mudrā and gesture of equanimity.
To you whose body is utterly pure, I offer homage!
Your heart radiates rays of light,
Which purify all the sufferings of beings without exception.
To the one and only friend who leads to the supreme state,
The one who has perfected enlightened qualities, I offer homage!
Your enlightened body, speech and mind are never separate from sentient beings,
So even merely to hear your name
Removes all faults and brings enlightenment—of this there is no doubt.
To you I offer homage, in you I take refuge: please grant me your protection!

Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche
Through the power of your bodhicitta vow over countless aeons,
In our time, you illuminated the entire teaching of the buddhas,
Venerable vinaya master and upholder of the three vows, to you we pray:
Appear again swiftly as a youthful rūpakāya emanation!

In Praise of Yangleshö in Nepal
Homage to the glorious Vajra Heruka!
The blazing body of the heruka resides here,
And the great mudrā, whose nature is wisdom.
This is the primordial heaven of Akaniṣṭha,
Transferred into this very world—amazing!
The features of the indestructible vajra body
Are all manifest here as external forms.
Look carefully: it is ornamented with the auspicious signs,
Representing the purest aspects of consciousness.
There is a crystal white peak as a sign of union,
The coming together of a HAṂ and A-stroke,
Beautifully adorned with thickest woodland.
As the cakra of manifestation, the land
Lies in the shape of a sphere, a single bindu.
Awareness is represented by deep refreshing pools,
Offerings of the six tastes and sensual delights,
With bliss-sustaining goddesses dancing and playing.
“A” is the sound of emptiness signifying the unborn nature,
And “sura” the intoxicating drink of crazy yogic conduct.
Proclaiming the fearsome sounds of great power,
The three kinds of ego-clinging rudra are destroyed,
And the great Glorious One’s enlightened form, mantra and attributes
Manifest clearly all around, as if competing with one another.
Here the Lotus King (Pema Gyalpo) Tötreng Tsal,
On the night of the great accomplishment of Yangdak,
Liberated obstructing māras through Kīlaya,
And at dawn attained complete awakening.
As a result of this blessing, this great and sacred place
Is without equal anywhere upon the Earth.
Through these words of praise, elegantly composed,
Describing the outer, inner and secret nature of this place,
May all the beings of the three worlds be liberated,
And may they enter the city of the supreme and secret practice.
Once again, may the store of priceless Dharma riches—
The treasures of the father—be enjoyed by his heirs,
And may the melodious sounds of perfect joy resound throughout the three worlds,
Pervading the whole of Jambudvīpa.

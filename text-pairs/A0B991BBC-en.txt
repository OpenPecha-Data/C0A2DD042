Verses of Auspiciousness
Homage to the Three Jewels!
Possessing every excellence, like a mountain of burnished gold,
Lord of the three worlds who has abandoned the three types of flaw,
Awakened One whose eyes are like lotuses in full bloom—
This is the first auspiciousness, which grants peace to living beings.
The teachings that He imparts are sublime and unchanging,
Famed throughout the three worlds, honoured by gods and humans alike,
The sacred Dharma which grants peace to all living beings—
This is the second auspiciousness, which brings virtue to the world.
Those who possess the Dharma and are rich with the fortune of learning,
The Saṅgha, worshipped by humans, gods, and demi-gods,
Most supreme of communities, modest, and glorious—
This is the third auspiciousness, which brings virtue to the world.

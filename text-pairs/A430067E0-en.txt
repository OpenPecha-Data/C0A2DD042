Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Jamyang Khyenrab Tayé 1
Through the brilliance of the Mañjughoṣa Guru’s delight,
Wisdom’s infinite radiance pervades the three worlds.
Supreme embodiment of altruism, kindness and love,
Mighty spiritual friend and teacher, to you I pray.
Buddha’s teachings are the source of benefit and happiness,
And you are peerless in upholding them,
A great scholar in the definitive sense,
Khyenrab Thayé—'Limitless Wisdom'—to you I pray.
Alas! Now that this protector, sun-like in wisdom,
Reposes in absolute space, darkness has come.
Into the murky gloom of ignorance and folly
Let the light of this protector’s wisdom shine!
Wherever you may have gone, do not resort, I pray,
To the extreme of self-serving peace and highest ecstasy,
But send infinite emanations throughout the ten directions
To bring immense benefit to the teachings and to beings.
For me, too, from this time on throughout my future lives,
May you never forsake me in your compassion, O protector,
And may you always inspire me with renunciation, discipline,
Sublime bodhicitta and realization of the authentic view.

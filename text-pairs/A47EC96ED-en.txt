Homage to the Glorious Vajraḍākinī
I pay homage to the protector of beings, Glorious Vajraḍākinī, Universal sovereign of the ḍākinīs, the very essence of the five wisdoms and three bodies
I pay homage to all the vajraḍākinīs Who cut the bonds of conceptual thought and descend to act in the world
Now, following that, I will explain the tantra called The Supreme Secret of the Secret Goddesses, the Vajraḍākinīs
She pervades the entire Egg of Brahmā, the animate and inanimate
She is the source of all goddesse
rules over Brahmā and the res
She is their great secre
the great Queen Mahāmāy
She is the great illusion, intensely fierce, who destroys all that exist
She pervades all of thi
the animate and inanimate, the three world
Time after time she gathers in and again emanates the triple worl
This mother of the guhyakas is celebrated as the essence of illusio
She is the knowledge that perfects the three worlds and fulfills all desire
Through the mere thought of the queen of the accomplished, knowledge itsel
The devas, dānavas, gandharvas, yakṣas, āsuras, and human
The vidyādharas, the kinnaras, and mahodaras, The rākṣasas and piśāca
all are mastered for practitioner
All creatures are subdue
those born in the water and on lan
Phenomena are naturally luminou
they are primordially pure and without stai
The methods of those possessing the self-arisen five wisdoms are to be praise
These are the yoginīs, the mother of yog
and the entirety of the three world
The entire play of illusion is accomplished without exclusion or remainde
Abducted from the buddhas, the maidens of the highest gods are enjoye
He enters the citadel of another, is invisible, and so on. He causes hostility, renders mute and moves under the eart
Becomes the universal sovereign of vidyādharas, does not age, and is deathles
One with knowledge of yogic illusion is likewise free from disease— Yogīs revel in the form of the mantra’s syllable
Through recitation and contemplation, meditation and absorptio
The vidyā created through recitation brings about the accomplishment of knowledg
Without discipline or austerities, without hardship, fasting, or vow
Bliss and Joy bring accomplishmen
through constancy in knowledge and metho
The Virile One stands in the center of the navel
in the hidden space of the blosso
He is mind, the absence of mind, and mental form—the nature of knowledge and what can be know
I will now describe him—this is the profound instruction of the Buddh
A chain equal to that of the āli kāli is coiled ther
The upper chain ignites and is made to flow downward
A drop of nectar flowing in the form of semen
Whatever comes on the path of the senses is naturally just that
Through the practice of supreme benefi
The spiritual attainment of the great commitment is the perfection of the great pil
In the embrace of Mahāmāyā you should practice yogic unio
Endowed with the five offerings together with the five objects of desir
The power of accomplishment will be known and spiritual attainment made permanent
I will explain this spiritual attainment of wisdom, By which the state of a god is swiftly attaine
Goddess, I speak truthfully
To you, Mahāmāyā, I will explain the accomplishment of the three world
The garland of syllables of the most excellent among the great yoginī
The great yogī who masters the animate and inanimate with thought alone Is constantly offered desirable things and served according to his pleasur
He is always at play and accomplishes the vajra yoginī
In a variety of forms the essential practice is reveale
The great attainment, the splendor of the tathāgatas, is grante
Through extracting various essence
constantly benefits beings
He gains long life, great virility, great splendor, and becomes exceedingly powerfu
With the collected semen, liquor, and extracted large pill
He mixes in the great flesh and unites with the yogin
He possesses divine sight, magical ability, and drinks the moon day after da
He becomes long-lived so that he lives for a great ag
With merely a thought his appearance is transforme
The queen of vidyās, the great enchantres
Vidyā! In the three worlds there is nothing equal to my knowledg
This transmission of all tantra
has been explained to you, Magnificent One
This completes the first instruction on the signs of spiritual attainment of The Great Vidyā, Queen of the Yoginīs
is unfailingly accomplished through recitatio
He manifests an alluring form and conjures miracle
Now, following that, I will explain the sublime secret syllable that bestows the result of the spiritual attainment for the practice of the great queens of yog
Merely visualizing her, the yoginī grants the best of thing
Apply the first syllable and sustain the upward breat
The yogī moves the downward breat
abandoning the real and unrea
Taking that which comes at the end of the eigh
together with ū and the bind
The observances are not explained
The threefold practice is said to be essentially mantra, appearance, and reality
Through three aspects of wisdo
he will not be stained by the faults of existenc
The yogī who constantly meditates on this without interruptio
Is equal to Vajrasattva an
gains accomplishment in a single mont
Meditate upon the first syllable which is the color of Indra
Merged fully with one’s own awarenes
it is summoned in an instan
The one possessing the second syllable is imagined and cultivate
One gains power over everything within the whole of the three world
Brahmā, and lord Viṣṇu, so too Indra and the Lord of Desir
Invoked with the wisdom syllabl
they are summoned along with their wive
settled in awakened body, speech, and min
Perform the threefold union—this is the supreme extraction of the pill
Possessing the syllable kh
is the four-faced one with a red bod
Skull cup in hand he is passion itself—this is the supreme extraction of semen
Possessing the syllable ci is one yellow in color who shines brightl
With the form of a horse’s fac
engaging him is the supreme extraction of the liquor
is red in color and exceedingly brigh
Has four arms and four face
appears in the form of a jackal
Cultivating this wrathful min
is the supreme extraction of blood
Endowed with the six syllables
they are fixed in the six places
The practice, the host of ḍākinīs, and the vajra yoginīs are accomplished
The two eyes, the ears, and so too the nose and the mind
While meditating with the movement of breath controlled, it blazes in an instan
Akaniṣṭha, the summit of existence
the seven worlds of the animate and inanimate
All meditate upon it, but they don’t realize it
If everyone realized it
the manifestations of beings would utterly collapse
Therefore this wisdom is secret, obscure, and unwritten
Because the awakened ones know
they who are immersed in yogic sleep, They concentrate upon the pil
meditate on the singular nature of forms
They meditate on the essence of the substances arisen from the nine doors
consume them with a mind free of concepts and devoid of intrinsic nature
With the thumb and ring finger
place the wish-granting jewel in the mouth
attain the everlasting spiritual attainment arisen from the nature of the nectar
This completes the second instruction on the practice of The Great Vidyā, Queen of the Yoginīs
Now comes a thorough explanation of the supreme accomplishment of the samaya
The ingestion of the other gathered substances that bestow the result of omniscience
By their mere consumptio
and also the five wisdom nectars
From the fourteenth to the eight
Elephant and horse, and so too cow and dog
they are combined and mingled together
Left inside a jackal for seven days, remove them
Roll the five into pellets the size of mustard seeds
Indeed this tantra teaches that from the eighth to the fourteent
Cultivate them individually for seven days, mix them, and place them in a jackal
Take them out—from the five make pellets the size of the fruit of spiritual attainment
Because the great fruition is perfectly realized, it is taught in this tantra but fully conceale
The buddhas have concealed the great fruition in every instance
Next follows the method of practice
visualize a mind lotu
Glowing red in colo
endowed with the four goddesses
It is adorned with the figure of the Buddha
In the east he shines like a blue lotus, to the south he is yellow, To the west whitish red, and in the north he glows emerald
Shrouded in a garland of flames
he is beautiful with three eyes, four faces, and four arms
Imagine that the goddess in the east has three eyes and holds a khaṭvāṅga and bell in her left hands and a vajra and skull cup in her right hands
The goddess in the south wields a trident, a jewel, a banner, and a jackal
The goddess in the west holds a bow, an arrow, a multi-colored lotus, and a skull cup
The goddess in the north wields a sword, a noose, a hand drum, and a skull cup
In its center visualize the vajra body, speech, and min
Bearing a skull cup and khaṭvāṅga, and so too a bow and arrow
Meditating on that which possesses the first mantra, it blazes for an instant
Practicing like this, the yogī is granted the spiritual attainment of the substance
Through the accomplishment of the yoginī, confidence swiftly develops
One can become entirely invisible and manifest a thousandfold at once
Plunder from the buddhas and enjoy sublime celestial girls
With vajra eyes one will see, like an āmalaka fruit in the palm of one’s hand. Buddhas equal to grains of sand in the Ganga residing in their vajra realms
the features of awakened body, speech, and mind
Pure realms numerous as sand in the Ganga
The intrinsic condition of all object
know them to arise from the mind’s dance
Apply the syllables in revers
meditate on the mantra
Ingest each one of the pills infused with the vajra drink
together with the ū and bindu
In perfect union with the yogin
take possession of the first syllable
If desiring accomplishment through the vajra holder
a yogī consumes the manifest mantra seven times
The last of the three syllables sits clearly at the end of the eight
Endowed with the ū and bind
it remains as the supreme syllable
The one linked to the first syllable is united with hrīḥ
Fix it firmly at the end and clearly pronounce the mantra: guhya bhakṣa abhakṣe hūṁ
Meditate upon the syllable and cause the lotus to fully bloom
this union should be fully known
For those who seek the accomplishment of a vajra holder
You have been aroused by the dance of great bliss
Apply the last of the syllables and fix in place the five seeds
Then, simply through this song sung to the great vajra holde
The vajraḍākinīs dance and call out to Vajrasattva
In this way one with consistent devotio
gains the spiritual attainment of union
accomplishment is gained—this is the supreme meditation
Adorned with all perfect ornaments and wreathed with flowers and perfume
Through perfect union in the four times
So the spiritual attainment that bestows the sublime three bodies is certainly attained
Causing its perfect illumination within a hundred miles
From the perfect application of the two power
arise the substances of the nine doors
One will accomplish the unsurpassable essence, the peace of abiding in the awakening of buddhahood
Now, in verse form
The forms, the seals, and the attributes
The substances, absorptions, and meditations
These various ritual methods have been set forth
Taught according to the desires of the goddess’s mind
Whoever keeps this tantra at home, keeps it with him always, and chants and meditates upon i
will no longer experience illness, aging, obstacles, or death
He will be forever protected from obstacles by the queens among yoginīs
This completes the third instruction on the method of practice and ancillary activities, the supreme secret of secrets, that are the intent of the great vajraḍākinīs
This completes the Mahāmāyātantra
It was translated and edited by the Indian paṇḍita Jinavara and the great Tibetan translator Gö  Lhetsé
You have become aroused by the dance of great bliss
Hey, friend! The vajra makes the lotus swell and bloom
The yogī has knowledge, masters yoga and weaves Indra’s Web
He beguiles and paralyzes, slays, dissuades, and more. He tames, magnetizes, and so forth; he flies through the sky
all becomes the nature of the Buddha
the activities of the garland mantra, Of retention, and of fire offerings are all omitted
Endowed with the syllable 
The one possessing the syllable r
Yogīs take the posture of a sporting lion
the mothers of the spirits are accomplishe
Mixed with the great on
the last of the eight syllable
Then, the sublime vajra song which is the realization of the vajra yoginīs welcomes the one who thoroughly accomplishes existenc
A la la la la ho
The rays of the sun fully open the face of the lotu

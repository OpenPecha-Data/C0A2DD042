Youthfulness Gained in Vajra-like Immortality Verses of Truth for the Long Life of the Perfect Masters
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ. The supreme body, unchanging, is Vairocana, longevity's king,
The supreme speech, unceasing, is the lotus lord of life,
The supreme mind, unerring, is Akṣobhya with life beyond limit,
Together with those of spontaneous qualities and unhindered activity,
The hosts of long-life deities from the ratna and karma families—
Grant your blessings, so that this master's life may be secure!
oṃ amāraṇi jīvantaye svāhā
In the supreme place, utterly pure, a realm of deathlessness and eternity,
Is a vajra throne supported by the lions of fearlessness,
Upon which the root guru appears in the form of Orgyen of Boundless Life,
Drawing in the vital nectar of saṃsāra and nirvāna with light from his body—
May the victorious ones and their heirs grant the long-life empowerment,
So that you gain accomplishment in the rainbow body's indestructible form!
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi āyuṣe hūṃ bhrūṃ ṇrī jaḥ siddhi phala hūṃ āḥ
I appear in the form of the awesome heruka, Vajrakumāra,
And from my body send out countless Supreme Son emanations,
Who swiftly liberate all obstacles, enemies and obstructing forces.
Through the merit of liberating all who are hostile to the guru's form,
May I too be victorious in the battle over the obstructing maras,
And raise the victory banner for the study and practice of the teachings!
oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya sarva vighnān baṃ hūṃ phaṭ
The noble lady Tārā appears in the sky before me,
With utpala flower and endless knot, radiant as the rising sun,
And as her light shines on us all, teacher and disciples,
May all our aims and wishes swiftly be fulfilled,
And, gaining the indestructible force of deathless life,
May we always uphold the teachings of the Buddha,
As we bring ever greater benefit and happiness to all beings!
oṃ tāre tuttāre ture sarva artha siddhi siddhi kuru svāhā

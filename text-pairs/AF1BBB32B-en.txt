The Hero's Bellowing Laughter In Praise of the Lord of Yogins
Namo guru virūpa-pādāya!
Through binding wind-energy within the space of dhūti ,
You arose in the form of the mudrā of changeless great bliss.
You are the glorious heruka Vajra Sun,
Displaying the form of a resplendent Lord of Yogins.
With all the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the space of Cakrasaṃvara,
You reached the peak of the jewelled crest, the supreme inner stage,
The supreme heruka, the vajra form of Hevajra.
Through a hundred moods of passionate blaze and movement,
You pervade the three realms, bellowing with laughter: 'Ha! Ha!'
Your mind of clear light in which bliss and emptiness are indivisible,
Is free from obscuration and exceedingly pure;
It extends everywhere, encompasses every entity.
With your glorious qualities of the vajra being of Supreme Bliss,
Your activity, as vast as space, extends forever.
Great lord of yogins, to you I pray!
May I attain the supreme splendour of the fearless heruka!

A Prayer of Aspiration for the Copper-Coloured Mountain of Glory
Lotus-Born, you are inseparable from our original nature.
Your realm, the Copper-Coloured Mountain of Glory,  is our experience in its purity.
May we take birth in this primordially pure realm,
The uncontrived natural stateâ€”appearance and awareness indivisible!

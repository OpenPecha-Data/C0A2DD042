Prayer for the Long Life of Sogyal Rinpoche
Oá¹ƒ svasti! Your marvellous form manifests from measureless acts of merit.
Far and wide you make the Dzogchen teachings of the Three Categories and Nine Spaces resound.
You are the incarnation who is the victory banner of the Ancient Tradition:
May the blessing of Guru Rinpoche make your life forever secure and firm!

Kind and precious Lord Atiśa, to you I pray!
Through these prayers of mine, made with a mind of vivid and unshakeable faith,
To these most brilliant of scholars, who, like ornaments, enhanced and beautified the world,
And were the supreme sources for so many wondrous and excellent teachings,
May my mind be blessed so that it is matured and brought to liberation!
May I be blessed so that I plant the foundation for the path to freedom:
May I understand the fundamental nature of reality and the meaning of the two truths,
Gain certainty about the four truths and how saṃsāra is perpetuated or discontinued,
And, through valid cognition, develop stable and lasting faith in the Three Jewels.
May I be blessed so that I come to master uncontrived bodhichitta,
Together with its roots: a mind of renunciation seeking the goal of perfect liberation,
In which all forms of suffering and their causes are thoroughly pacified,
And a compassionate wish to protect all beings, as limitless as space itself.
May I be blessed so that I arrive easily at a definitive understanding
Of all the profound points of the paths of the transcendent perfection vehicle
And the vajrayāna, through studying, reflecting and meditating
Upon the meaning of the great pioneering masters’ classic works.
In life after life, may I always find the perfect situation and take up the threefold training,
May I work for the good of the teachings, just like the great pioneering masters of old,
And, through teaching as well as through practice,
May I maintain and enhance the transmission and understanding of the Dharma.
In every community may there be more and more great scholars and practitioners,
Who avoid entirely all unethical and mistaken forms of livelihood,
And devote their time to study and reflection, teaching and meditation,
So that the whole world is enhanced and made beautiful to behold!
Through the power of this, may I swiftly traverse all the paths and stages
Of the complete approach combining sutra and mantra,
To reach the level of an omniscient buddha spontaneously benefitting myself and others,
And may I continue to fulfil the wishes of beings for as long as space exists!

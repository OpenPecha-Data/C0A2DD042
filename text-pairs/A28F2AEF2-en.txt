Regularly Recitable Prayer to the Root Guru
You embody all sources of refuge, the three seats complete within your form,
Your speech proclaims the Dharma that dispels the torment of the afflictions,
And your mind possesses the five wisdoms and bliss, clarity and non-thought—
Sovereign preserver of secrets, Vajra Holder,
Loter Wangpo, at your feet I pray:
With body, speech and mind, I offer everything to you.
Dispel all outer, inner and secret obstacles.
I confess all faults and impairments and breakages of samaya.
Cause all my wishes to be spontaneously fulfilled.
Grant the supreme and common attainments, I pray.
Inspire me to fulfil my own and others’ purpose.
Hold me in your compassion, never parting, until awakening.

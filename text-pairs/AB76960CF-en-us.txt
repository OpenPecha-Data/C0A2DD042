The Noble Mahāsūtra Entering the City of Vaiśāl
Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was residing in Nāḍikā, at the Impenetrable Dwelling Place
The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, let us proceed to the city of Vaiśālī.
“Let us do so, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, assenting to what the Blessed One had said
Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Vaiśālī
In Vaiśālī, he stayed in Āmrapālī’s grove
At that time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, go to the city of Vaiśālī, place your foot on the threshold of the city gate, an
utter these mantras and these verses
“ ‘ Visarata visarata visarata visarat
“ ‘The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken
This is the wish of all buddhas
It is the wish of all pratyekabuddhas
It is the wish of all arhats
It is the wish of all those undergoing training
It is the wish of all śrāvakas
It is the wish of all who speak words of truth
It is the wish of the Dharma
It is the wish of Brahmā
It is the wish of Pratyeka­brahman
It is the wish of Kāmeśvara
It is the wish of Indra
It is the wish of the gods
It is the wish of the lord of the demigods
It is the wish of all demigods
It is the wish of the servants of the demigods
It is the wish of all bhūtas
“ ‘ Visarata visarata visarata visarat
“ ‘The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken
“ ‘ Muñcata muñcat
“ ‘Do not stay
The epidemic should cease
“ ‘ Nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchat
“ ‘The Buddha, the Great God, the God of Gods, the Supreme God, has arrived
The gods including Indra, the gods including Brahmā, the gods including Īśāna, the gods including Prajāpati, and the Four Protectors of the World have come
Hundreds of thousands of gods, lords of the demigods, and hundreds of thousands of demigods have also come
Hundreds of thousands of bhūtas who have faith in the Blessed One have also come for the sake of all living beings, an
they have come to bring great harm to you; so
“ ‘ Nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchat
“ ‘Disperse quickly. Those of you who have hateful thoughts, may you be destroyed
Those who have loving thoughts, who do not wish to sin but wish to protect beings, sta
and take on physical form
The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken. “ ‘ Sumu sumu | sumu sumu sumu | sumuru sumuru | sumuru sumuru | sumuru sumuru | sumuru sumuru | muru muru | muru muru | muru muru | muru muru | miri miri | miri miri | miri miri miri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murūrīti | riri riri riri | rīrī rīrī rīrīti | miri miri miriti | hisi miri miriti | mirisi sīsīmī | kaṅkarā karakata | kaṅkarā karakacā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkaro titi kuriśo | kaṅkara kaṅkariśi | ririri ririri | hiritaphu svā | ripu ripu | ripu ripu | ripu ripu | ripu ripu | nāthā nānā | thā thā | ripu ripu | nāthātha | nirgacchata nirgacchata | ripu ripu | nirgacchata palāyāta | ripū ripū pālāyata 
“ ‘The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, whose wish is to benefit all living beings, who abides in love, who is compassionate, who abides in joy, and who abides in equanimity, has arrived
“ ‘ Kṣipraṃ nirgacchata svāh
“These mantras, which were proclaimed to all the gods and all the bhūtas through the Buddha’s supreme wisdom and truth, will accomplish their purpose
The following verses will accomplish their purpose
“ ‘He in whom all attachment and greed Are conquered, all defilement gone, His mind at peace without harmful intent— He will bring you well-being

“ ‘The alluring one who defeated All the extremists with the Dharma And brought all assemblies under his influence— He will bring you well-being
“ ‘May the Buddha bring you well-being
May Śakra and the gods bestow well-being; And may well-being from the bhūtas, too, Be provided to you always
“ ‘By the Buddha’s merit and power And the wishes of the gods, May whatever goal you seek This very day be accomplished
“ ‘Two-legged beings, be well
Four-legged beings, be well
When you set out, be well
And when you return, be well
“ ‘Be well in the daytime; be well in the night; Be well at midday, too. May all of you be always well
May all of you know no evil
“ ‘Surrounded by a thousand gods, The Buddha has arrived— So, you with hateful thoughts, disperse! And you whose nature is compassion, stay
“ ‘By the power of the true words of the buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, arhats, and those being trained, Those who do harm to the world Should be gone from this city

May you all be free from illness
May you all see what is good
May all of you know no evil
“ ‘May whatever bhūtas are assembled here, All those who live upon the earth or in the sky, Act always lovingly for human beings And practice Dharma day and night.’ 
To these instructions, the venerable Ānanda replied, “I will do so, O Honored One.

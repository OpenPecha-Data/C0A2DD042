The Quintessential Blessing: A Guru Yoga
I take refuge in the Lama, embodiment of the Three Jewels,
And generate bodhicitta, so as to place all beings in the state of lasting bliss.
My perception of the environment and its inhabitants as a pure field is clear,
In the sky before me, atop a precious lion throne and cushions of lotus and sun,
The glorious Lama, the elegant bhikṣu
Gyurme Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö
Clad in the three saffron robes,
Vivid, clear, yet without self-nature.
I prostrate with body, speech and mind, present an ocean of offering clouds,
And confess all negative actions and downfalls;
I rejoice in the ultimate liberation of all, request you to turn the Wheel of Dharma, implore you not to enter nirvāṇa,
But to remain; and dedicate all merit.
Unchanging heart, the Buddha-nature,
Altruistic lord of words , Dharma speech,
Venerable master, Kāya, with intelligence ’s name;
I beg you from my heart, please bless me!
oṃ āḥ guru akṣara vāgindra dharmamati siddhi hūṃ hūṃ
Light rays emanate from the Lama’s body, serially, and then all together;
They dissolve into my four places and I receive the four empowerments.
The Lama's heart and my mind merge as one, and within this profound ground, free of elaboration,
The transference of the realization of the ultimate tantra….Ah.
Through this merit may all beings achieve the state of the Venerable Master
And may auspiciousness pervade all!

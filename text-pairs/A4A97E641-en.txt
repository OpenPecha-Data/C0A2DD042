Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche, the Incarnation of Do Khyentsé Yeshé Dorjé
Oṃ svasti! Through the blessings of the Three Roots, and the power of the infallible law of interdependence,
May the secret body, speech and mind of this sun-like incarnation, Thubten Nyima,
The one who causes the lotus garden of Buddha’s teachings to flourish and blossom,
Remain forever secure within the absolute and unchanging nature, we pray!

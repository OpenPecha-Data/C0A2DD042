Short Vajrakīla Dokpa
Hūṃ! Out of the unchanging space of the ground, dharmakāya's vast expanse,
You manifest unimpededly as its dynamic power, deities of Kīla—
Please accept this torma of indivisible space and rigpa,
And dispel all delusory appearances, sickness, harmful influences, enemies and obstructing forces into all-pervading space!

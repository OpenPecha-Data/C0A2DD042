The Swift Fulfilment of Wishes A Prayer for the Swift Return of the Supreme Tulku of the Fifth Drubwang Dzogchen Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti.
Through the forceful truth of the compassion of infinite deities of the Three Roots,
And the power and strength of an ocean of oath-bound guardians related to the three tantras,
Together with the force of reality itself, inspire us with your blessings
So that these pure objects of aspiration may be swiftly and unobstructedly fulfilled!
Dzogchenpa, sovereign of Dharma throughout the three realms,
Glorious guru Chökyi Dorje,
May the wondrous, moon-like face of your supreme emanation
Swiftly reappear as a protector of the teachings and beings in general
And  of the Dharma that is taught and practised in the Great Secret Ancient Translation School in particular.
Arise in a body of form out of the dharmadhātu expanse,
To bring perfect victory over obstacles and the forces of Māra.
Through spontaneously accomplishing the two aims with the four means of attraction, 1
May you fulfil the hopes and dreams of infinite living beings!

The Swift Bestowal of Blessings A Prayer to the Glorious Protector Guru
Oṃ svasti!
Embodiment of all the qualities of knowledge, power and love
Of Mañjughoṣa and all the other conquerors of the three families,
Essence of radiant light from the Lake-Born Vajra’s heart,
With boundless intelligence and confidence—to you I pray.
In the basic space of the inexhaustible secrets of all the bliss-gone buddhas,
Including Mañjughoṣa and the eight great glorious sādhana deities,
You are the all-pervasive lord, the source of all causal and resultant phenomena,
Master of wondrous intelligence—to you I pray.
Your gentle form embodies the wisdom all the victorious ones with their marks and signs,
Your melodious voice proclaims the Dharma, vast and profound, which frees all beings,
Heruka, whose wise and loving intelligence knows no bounds,
Forefather of the ḍākinīs of the three abodes—to you I pray.
Through the wondrous truth of the Three Root deities,
May the glorious guru’s deathless wisdom form
Remain forever in the lotus of my heart
And guide me throughout all my lives to come!

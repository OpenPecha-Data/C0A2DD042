The Melody of the Deathless Vajra Imploring the Three Deities of Immortal Life to Fulfil Wishes and Grant Attainment
Namo guru ārya-tārāyai!
Oṃ svasti.
Your sublime form is deathless and eternal,
Your nāda-speech the unceasing melody of Brahma,
Your mind the indestructible vajra wisdom—
Guru Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, protect me!
You have gained the youthfulness of Vajrasattva,
And are constantly intoxicated by the nectar
Of the great blissful play of union—
Root and lineage masters, grant your blessings! 1
Mother of all the victorious ones of the three times,
Your form that of the Perfection of Wisdom,
Bestower of the two forms of attainment,
Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, accept and care for me!
The brilliant light from a billion
Moons, conches and water crystals
Could not produce a fraction of your radiance—
Amitāyus, the natural play
Of the wisdom of discernment, to you I bow.
Born from the uṣṇīṣa of the tathāgatas,
With your powerful vidyā-mantra,
You who conquer all the demonic forces of the Lord of Death,
Vijayā, to you I offer homage and praise.
Through completing the approach, accomplishment and activity
Of the three deities of immortal life,
May I gain victory over the forces of the Lord of Death
And may you grant me the attainments of longevity, merit and wisdom.
May my mindstream be rich with magnificent attainments,
May signs of deathlessness permeate the environment and those within it,
May the vital essence of existence and quiescence be enhanced,
And may all be auspicious for there to be sublime everlastingness!

Aspiration towards Sukhāvatī
Emaho!
From here, over in the direction of the setting sun,
In a place many countless worlds away,
Lies the utterly pure realm of Sukhāvatī, 'the Blissful',
There resides the supreme and perfect Buddha,
Boundless Life and Light.
To that Lord and protector, I pay homage.
I offer clouds of imagined gifts, just like Samantabhadra's.
I confess misdeeds accumulated over many lifetimes.
I rejoice in the virtuous actions of all beings.
I request the turning of the Wheel of Dharma.
I pray that you do not pass into nirvāṇa.
And, through the virtues amassed in past, present and future,
I pray that as soon as my life ends and I pass from here,
I may be born in that sublime realm, and, like the Lord himself,
Perfectly achieve my own and others' aims—
Make this wish of mine come true, I pray!

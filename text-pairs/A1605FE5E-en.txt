Calling the Guru From Afar
Aho!
Primordial Buddha, self-arisen and pervading both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
You are the inexhaustible source of both the kāyas and qualities of luminosity;
Teacher possessed of the wisdom kāya that pervades the dharmadhātu—
Dharmakāya guru, Dorje Tukchok Tsal, care for me!
Magically you emanate and reabsorb
An infinite display of maṇḍala forms that defy the imagination,
Arising as the bindu of unchanging bliss and emptiness—
Saṃbhogakāya guru, Pema Wangchen Tsal, care for me!
The activity of all the victorious buddhas and their offspring blossomed
As the major and minor signs of this glorious master, Gentle Protector,
Whose unbiased benefit of the teaching and beings fulfils all wishes—
Nirmāṇakāya guru, Khyentse Özer, care for me!
Guru of supreme kindness, your tenderness is beyond compare.
May I never be separated from you: forever adorn my crown!
May the blessings of your profound illuminating wisdom
Transfer swiftly to my heart: pray bestow wisdom’s empowerment!
May my mind be tamed by faith, compassion, renunciation and bodhicitta;
May I master generation and perfection phases, complete the path of the four empowerments,
And win the royal domain of the primordial dharmakāya—
Bless me that my mind may merge with your omniscience!

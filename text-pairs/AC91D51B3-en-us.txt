The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra Teaching the Practice of a Bodhisattv
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was dwelling at the Kūṭāgāraśālā in the forest outside of Vaiśālī together with a great assembly of one thousand monks
All of them were worthy ones whose defilements were exhausted
They were without afflictions and in control
Their minds were perfectly free, and their insight was perfectly liberated
They were of noble birth
They were great elephants who had completed their objectives and done what must be done
They had laid down their burdens and fulfilled their aims
They had eliminated that which binds to existence
Their minds had been perfectly liberated by correct knowledge
They had obtained supreme perfection in mastering all mental states
Their behavior was peaceful, disciplined, free, and natural
The only exception was Venerable Ānanda
but the Blessed One had instructed him in the practice as well, an
he had been prophesied to become a worthy one in this life
Also present were one thousand bodhisattvas. All of them had attained the stage free from regression
All of them had obtained retention
All of them possessed the patience of equanimity
All of them had reached the stage where one practices exactly what has been proclaimed
They were wise, honest, and faithful
They were extremely confident and exceedingly graceful
They always smiled and never frowned angrily
They were steadfast and successful
They had realized the nature of phenomen
and never tired of teaching the Dharma
They had encountered the wisdom of a buddha and were bringing it to full maturity
They possessed unerring patience regarding allusive speech
They had attained the stage of being unmistaken regarding all objects
They knew the right time, season, occasion, and moment
They were free from agitation and arrogance
Their behavior was natural and perfect
They were skilled in the meditative absorption on emptiness
They had relinquished arising and disintegration
They possessed the meditative absorption on wishlessness
They had practiced bodhisattva conduct in cyclic existence for a long time
They possessed the meditative absorption on signlessness
They correctly understood the characteristics of all the content of mental constructs
They were skilled in maturing beings
They were free from ideation
They were skilled in the presentation of the Hearer Vehicle
They engaged in properly distinguishing the teachings of the Dharma
They taught the Solitary Buddha Vehicle
They praised tranquility
They inspired beings to become bodhisattvas
They behaved appropriately, teaching the Dharma without hatred or animosity
Among them were the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, Pratibhānakūṭa, Ratnapāṇi, Gandhaprabha, Ananta­prabhāsamati, Apāyajaha, Siddhārtha­cintin, Guṇa­rāja­prabhāsa, Sarva­śokāndha­kārāpoha­mati, Sarva­viṣamadarśin, Tat­svabhāvā­pratiṣṭhita, Anantamati, Vīrya, Vikrama­saṃdarśa­kacintin, Ratnākara, Vyūharāja, Vikurvāṇarāja, Avyabhicāra­prabhāva, Viśeṣamati, Samanta­prāsādika, Anāvaraṇa­darśin, Vikrīḍamāna, Suvarṇottama­prabhā­śrī, Sarva­dharma­nityadarśana­dhīmat, Āśugandhadāna­kusumita, Jyeṣṭhakūṭa, Aśokaśrī, Merudāra, Avalokiteśvara, Gandheśvara­rāja, Prāmodyarāja, Ananta­mati­pratipatti, Sarvasa­ddharmā­vismaraṇasthita, and the bodhisattva great being Siṃha­nādābhinādin
Also dwelling with them were many thousands of other bodhisattvas
One morning the Blessed One donned his lower and upper robes
took up his alms bowl, and went to collect alms in the city of Vaiśālī accompanied and attended by two thousand monks
As soon as the Blessed One placed his foot at the threshold of the city gates, the following wondrous miracles occurred, miracles that occur whenever the blessed buddhas enter a city
blind people gained sight
deaf people gained hearing
and the insane regained their senses
A rain of divine flowers fell, a bright light shone
and the roads became free of filth
The enchanting musical instruments of the gods resounded even without being played
All beings, from the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment up to the Highest Heaven, became completely happy
At that time in the city of Vaiśālī there was a boy named Ratnadatta who had been born as the son of a Licchavi man named Siṃha
The three-year-old was sitting on his mother’s lap on the top floor of their house, an
when he witnessed these miraculous signs
the boy Ratnadatta spoke the following verses to his mother
“Mother, whose magical power Has manifested these extraordinary miracles
This light outshines the radiance Of millions of suns. Whose is it
“It pervades the ground of the three-thousand-fold worl
And dries up the lower realms
What is this magical light
Quick, Mother, please tell me
“A rain of unseasonable flowers Continually beautifies this buddha realm
And everywhere flocks of birds Fill the air with song
“The roads are covered with flowers
The flower parasols unfurled
And both sides are adorned With happy men and women
“Blind people have gained sight
Deaf people can hear sounds
Those who were ugly are now handsome
Those of poor complexion now have perfect skin
“The bewildered have regained their senses
The mute can speak clearly
And beings who had no love in their hearts Are now filled with love
“Quick, Mother, tell me
Who is this extraordinary bein
Who moves throughout the world
With the power to perform such miracles?
Ratnadatta’s mother answered him in the following verses
“He is a pure being with supreme conduct
A stainless victor without harmful inten
Who is beyond thought and utterly pure
He is powerful, exalted in precious virtues
“He is the world’s protector, refuge, and guide
This is our kinsman, the Thus-Gone One
A wise man come to beg alm
Who does not adhere to worldly duty
“He does not entertain mundane thoughts Such as pleasant or unpleasant
The lord engages in conduct without being stained, Like a lotus born from the water
“This intelligent one eliminates doubt
He benefits beings and is compassionate
To dispel the suffering of beings
Now this leader has come her
“Praise does not delight him
And blame does not upset him
He has abandoned anger and attachmen
And moves freely, like the wind
“He is a sublime dharma kin
Who has mastered profound wisdo
And is learned in the ultimate meaning
The teacher of beings has come
“He teaches the middle wa
That is free from grasping at existence or nonexistence
He possesses the path of Dharma and is peaceful
He has abandoned all types of dependence
“The one for whom wisdom is the aggregates’ lack of self
Who has gathered the accumulation of merit
The blissful one, the guide of the worl
Whose form is boundless, has come today
“His hair is coiled to the righ
And is soft, shiny, and curly
It is black, not matted
And perfectly adorns his head
“His crown protuberance circles to the right
Its hair is coiled, and it is perfectly placed
It resembles the peak of Mt. Meru
So beautiful is its shape
“The middle of his brow is adorned with a curled hai
That is smooth and turns to the right
Its radiance is far brighter than a lattic
Of pure crystal lunar rays
“His eyes are beautifu
Like blue lotus flowers
He has perfect eyelashes like a cow
He has a peaceful gaze without redness or agitation
“He has a jaw like a glorious lion
And he always has a smile on his face
His lips are red like a bimba fruit
His beautiful face attracts all embodied beings
“He has an abundance of great power and strength
The strength of hundreds of merits
The rows of his teeth have a beautiful shine
And they are even and perfectly spaced
“His teeth are pure white
His tongue is very long and thin
And with it he can completely cove
The surface of his own face
“The head of the glorious one is like a parasol
Likewise, his nose is prominent
His complexion is like refined gold
And he has a beautiful forehead
“His eyebrows are very pleasan
And the color of blue sapphire
His peaceful eyes are beautifu
And extend toward his ears
“His earlobes are long and dangling
His face is more beautiful than an autumn moo
And resembles a perfectly pure lotus
It is radiant, pure, and clear
“His speech is steady and eloquent
And his voice is kind, pleasing
And soft; it satisfies being
Like the call of a sparrow
“The sound of a peacock, A swan, a kinnara
A parrot, a myna, and a cuckoo
Of thunder, a crane
“A pheasant, a flute, the beat Of a clay drum; and anything else
However pleasant, does not match a sixteenth Of the voice of the Thus-Gone One
“It is inspiring, yet soft
It is sweet and gentle
Endearing, pleasing, and clear
It is flawless and fearless
“Like a steady rain for the hopeful
It satisfies and pacifies the mind
It is uncorrupted, unmistaken, perfectly peaceful
Pure, and also easy to comprehend
“It is auspicious, sweet
Meaningful, and possesses all good qualities
His poetic embellishments are perfect
His speech inspires virtue
“Beings with different inclinations An
different interpretation
Have faith in what he say
And become exceedingly happy
In the world systems of the ten directions
“His voice reaches all beings who abid
And the words of the protecto
Are rendered meaningful to all those beings
“That sage, supreme among beings, Has a neck like a conch and round shoulders
He is broad chested
And the seven parts of his body are prominent
“His arms are very long
His skin the color of gold
He is as tall as the wish-fulfilling tree
His girth like a banyan
“His chest is adorned with the endless knot
His lotus hands bear the imprints of a wheel
They are soft to the touch like cotton or flower petals
And their fingers are long
“Each body hair is present, upright, thick, and soft
His torso is broad and his navel is deep
His belly is the shape of a bow, and his genitals are retracted in a sheath like an elephant
He has calves like an antelope and with a white hue like the inside of a reed
“His ankle bones do not protrude, and his heels are well shaped
The sage’s fingers are long and his nails are red
The soles of the Blissful One’s feet are not arched
And they are adorned with wheels, hooks, svastikas, and conches
“The Lord’s feet are of equal proportion and steady
They are soft and pleasing to the touch like cotton
Their color is like a blooming red lotus
And with them he traverses the worlds
“The lion’s roar of the Thus-Gone One bestows happiness
This chief among beings has now arrived here
And the lack of mental constructs with the fearless roar of a lion.
And when he comes, he teaches the Dharma of nondualit
Then the boy Ratnadatta said to his mother
“Mother, put me in the window so I can see the Thus-Gone One,
so his mother sat him in the window
The Blessed One knew what Ratnadatta was thinking, so he walked right down his street
When the boy saw the Blessed One walking he thought
“Whoever sees the Thus-Gone One, who possesses all good qualities, an
does not generate the mind of awakening is indeed unfortunate.
The Blessed One proceeded right up to Ratnadatta’s doo
and the boy thought
“Since it is difficult to meet such an extraordinary being even in a trillion eons
I should jump down from this house.
With that thought, Ratnadatta placed his toy, a golden lotus with a hundred thousand petals, in the palm of his han
and [With that thought, Ratnadatta placed his toy, a golden lotus with a hundred thousand petals, in the palm of his hand and] jumped off the house
However, due to the Buddha’s power, he remained floating in midair
Ratnadatta then offered the golden lotus with a hundred thousand petals to the Blessed One
As soon as Ratnadatta let go of the lotus, the Blessed One transformed it into a lotus parasol adorned with a net of jewels, and it hovered in the sky directly above the Blessed One’s head
When that happened, the boy Ratnadatta recited the following verses
“I offer this lotus to the Buddha Seeking nothing in return
To eliminate all goals. I seek supreme awakenin
“Since in unborn awakening There is nothing to gain or los
And nothing to accept or reject, I offer this flower
That childish beings construct is pointless. “The conception of valu
So that I may eliminate all conceptual thought. I make this offering to the supreme human bein
“I do not offer this flower So that a result will ripen for me
To eliminate all existent things. I offer this lotus blosso
“In my buddha realm One will follow only the vehicle of the supreme victor
May even the names hearer or solitary buddha Not arise there.
Then, Venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana recited the following verse to the boy Ratnadatta
“Although you make this offering Out of faith in such a teacher, Your understanding is mistaken. How, then, will you become a buddha?
Ratnadatta replied to Venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana with the following verses
“All these entities are unborn
Conditioned things are hollow and void
How could such phenomena Have any substance
“You wear saffron monastic robe
And grasp at the state of a worthy one
But aren’t consciousness and its domai
Simply empty
“The millions of buddhas are not pleased By having recourse to apprehension
Those millions perceive only quiescence
And there is not one of them who does not find joy in that
“Maudgalyā­yana, do you still Engage in apprehension
Can someone who thinks as you d
Even purify a gift?
Venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana replied to Ratnadatta, saying
“Child, tell me, has the Thus-Gone One not become a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening? Furthermore, has he not taught the Dharma?
“Maudgalyā­yana,” Ratnadatta replied, “a wise person should not conceptualize awakening or formulate opinions about the Thus-Gone One
They should not impute concepts such as the thought that phenomena do not arise
the thought that all phenomena are conditioned, o
the thought that all phenomena are unconditioned
They should not impute concepts such as ‘all phenomena arise, do not arise, are existent, or are nonexistent,’ ‘grasping and letting go,’ ‘meeting and separating,’ ‘going, coming, remaining, transmigrating, phenomena associated with attachment, hatred, and delusion, and right and wrong.
They should not impute the concept that ‘ignorance and the like up to and including the qualities of hearers, the qualities of solitary buddhas, the qualities of the buddhas, the factors of pollution, the factors of purification, the physical and nonphysical, perception and lack of perception, marks and lack of marks, pure conduct, sameness, difference, body, mind, and all correct and incorrect qualities arise.
So you tell me, Maudgalyā­yana—do you think the thus-gone ones are complete buddhas who manifest unsurpassed and perfect awakening?
Maudgalyā­yana replied, “That is not the case.
The boy said, “Do you assert that the thus-gone ones are not included in suchness, that awakening is not included in suchness, or that ordinary beings are not included in suchness?
Maudgalyā­yana said, “That is not the case.
“Maudgalyā­yana,” the boy responded, “do you conceptualize the lack of conceptualization?
“I teach by means of the conventions of the world,” Maudgalyā­yana replied
The boy continued, “Maudgalyā­yana, the world is a fake, deceptive, and illusory appearance that tricks childish beings.
“Maudgalyā­yana,” answered the boy, [the world is a fake, deceptive, and illusory appearance] "phenomena cannot be demonstrated
“If the world is a fake and deceptive phenomenon,” said Maudgalyā­yana, “then this teaching is also a fake and deceptive phenomenon. Why, then, do you teach it?
They cannot be demonstrated, attained, actualized, abandoned, understood, or meditated upon.
Maudgalyā­yana replied, “If that is the case, what is the point of you making an offering to the Thus-Gone One?
“Maudgalyā­yana,” the boy asked, “do you apprehend a Thus-Gone One, someone who gives a gift, or an act of giving?
Venerable Maudgalyā­yana remained silent
so the boy Ratnadatta continued, “Maudgalyā­yana, with this in mind, I have given up becoming a thus-gone one an
say those who form the resolve set on the vehicle of the hearers ‘are indeed unfortunate.’ 
Maudgalyā­yana replied
“You are very young
Yet your insight is vast as the ocean
How long have you been Trained in these teachings?
Ratnadatta replied with the following verses
“All training perishes
Training is not training
Consists in being one who lacks training. The training of the wise one
“The question ‘what is the point?’ that you asked m
Is based upon the perceptions of beings
Any phenomena arising anywhere
And to this I say one does not fin
“Childish beings conceptualize Both awakening and cyclic existence
So do you, Venerable One, Still follow the way of childish beings
“Since they understand That all phenomena lack essence, The wise do not generate Concepts such as ‘near’ and ‘far.
“Intelligent ones do not differentiate Between childish beings and their qualities, Or the buddhas’ qualities and the victors
So you too should see these as merely empty
“That the great sage attained awakenin
Is an illogical imputation
If the phenomenon of awakening does not arise, How can one attain nirvāṇa
“An infinite number of teachings are proclaimed
Yet there is no such thing as the liberation of beings
Between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra. Understand this: there is no distinctio
“Thus, in all cases, There is never any increase or decrease
About the fact that phenomena are indistinct. The wise harbor no delusion
“Childish beings obtain and attain
A childish being who attains nirvāṇ
Is thoroughly attached to saṃsāra
Such conceited thinking is Māra’s trap
“Someone who thinks ‘I have attained’ Has not attained anything at all
They will proceed to their next birt
And start all over again in ignorance
“Abiding at the seat of awakening, There is nothing to see and nothing to abandon
The awakening of all the buddhas Is a conventional term but nothing in actuality
“Awakening and nirvāṇa Cannot be expressed by conventional terms
Those who see correctly in that way Fully understand the nature of reality
Venerable Śāriputra then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, how long has this boy Ratnadatta practiced this teaching?
The Blessed One replied
“When the thus-gone one Dīpaṁkara gave his prophecy that I would attain acceptance of the nonarising of phenomena
at that point he was foremost among those bodhisattvas who abided in emptiness according to Dīpaṁkara’s teachings
At the moment when I first generated the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, three hundred thousand eons had passed since he attained acceptance.
“Blessed One,” asked Śāriputra
“what cause and what conditions are responsible for the boy Ratnadatta not becoming a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening?
“You should ask Ratnadatta himself this question. He will tell you,” the Blessed One responded
So Venerable Śāriputra asked the boy Ratnadatta
“Why have you not become a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening?
“The reason I do not become a complete manifest buddha,” Ratnadatta replied, “is that I do not apprehend unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
“If that is so,” Śāriputra asked, “since this thus-gone one is a complete manifest buddha, do you apprehend him?
Ratnadatta replied, “If someone grasps at the Thus-Gone One as a complete manifest buddha, an
if he becomes the referent object of that grasping, the
the Dharma he teaches will not cause that person to become a complete manifest buddha, and it will not even bring about renunciation.
“Since you equate complete maturation with accomplishing the four factors, what is your acceptance based on?” Śāriputra asked
The boy Ratnadatta replied
“I do not perceive even a single phenomenon that is truly established, much less four
What is there truly established in them
‘Knowing the Dharma’ is apprehension
‘Awakening’ is apprehension
‘The Thus-Gone One’ is grasping
‘Liberation’ is a mental construct.
“Son of the lineage,” Śāriputra replied, “what a wonder that you experience things in this way an
that you have attained such a miraculous birth whereby you were born in the presence of the buddhas and will always go forth!
Ratnadatta then replied with the following verses
“Born and not born are both mental constructs
They are the level of conceptual imputation and the domain of Māra
Desire realm beings such as the gods and asuras who grasp at And harbor conceit about phenomena such as the body are destroyed in this domain
“Thinking, ‘The Victor attained the unconditioned, deathless state,
Some set out with the same intentio
And insult the buddhas
Though they attain it, there is nothing in it that the guides attain
“There are many people who, Having gone forth for this, presume they have gone forth
They are confused by mental apprehension And they corrupt the teachings
“Those who are proud of their attainment say, ‘I have attained deathlessness.
But the teaching of the protector, the lion of the Śākya clan, Lacks mental constructs
“Among all mental content One does not find the nature of mind
Thus, the view taught by the guide Has no inherent nature
“In the view taught by the Victor with pure vision There is no viewing
That is why those who have insight Do not grasp at the thought, ‘I am free.
“Those accustomed to apprehending marks Apprehend a self and are deluded
Such unwise people Reject emptiness as incorrect
“The unwise impute things With their own minds
Like a dream and an illusion. Then, when things cease, they call it nirvāṇa
“They take the body as a suppor
And do away with the notion of discipline
They take mental apprehention as a suppor
And do away with the notion of meditative absorption
“Likewise, they apprehend insigh
And have a deluded notion of it as a seed
The wise people of the worl
Proclaim them thieves of the Dharma
“The luminous expanse of phenomena, Free of afflictions, is in all such phenomena
The point of going forth
So, will you please tell m
“All phenomena are indistinct
They are like an echo
The sphere of the noble ones
The wise never conceptualiz
“Their characteristic is suchness and nothing else
They never transform into other things
Since phenomena are unchanging, What use is the concept of going forth?
Then Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta asked Ratnadatta
“Child, what is ‘awakening’ a verbal designation for?
“Mañjuśrī,” Ratnadatta replied, “awakening is devoid of verbal designations.
“How do you consider and verbally express it?” Mañjuśrī asked
Ratnadatta replied, “Mañjuśrī, since reality is inconceivable, I consider it as such and then express it.
Mañjuśrī asked, “How should beginner bodhisattvas be given instructions on this
How should they be taught about it?
Ratnadatta replied, “One should say the following
‘Do not abandon desire
Do not get rid of anger
Do not clear away delusion
Do not rise above the body
Practice nonvirtue
Do not vanquish views
Do not remove fetters
Grasp at the aggregates
Make the elements into a single mass
Engage the sense spheres
Do not go beyond the level of childish beings
Realize nonvirtue
Abandon virtue
Do not contemplate the Buddha
Do not think about the Dharma
Do not make offerings to the Saṅgha
Do not take up the trainings
Do not strive to pacify existence
Do not cross over the river.
“It is with such instructions that one should instruct [and teach] beginner bodhisattvas
[“It is with such instructions that one should instruct and] teach beginner bodhisattvas
Why is that
Because only this state is the state of phenomena
Childish beings declare that phenomena arise an
declare that phenomena cease
The realm of phenomena is discerned through nonconceptuality
If someone receives the instruction that understanding the nature of phenomena in this way is awakening, an
if they are not afraid, scared, or frightened by it, the
that person is a bodhisattva who will truly never regress
That bodhisattva who has reached the stage free from regression should be considered a fortunate one
Through these instructions, one should give rise to true joy again and again.
At that point, eight monks who maintained the view of apprehension refused to follow this Dharma teaching, rejected it, and left the assembly
They all vomited warm blood and died, an
after they died they were reborn in the Great Wailing Hell
At that point Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta alerted the Blessed One saying
“Blessed One, see how those monks have suffered such great harm by listening to this Dharma teaching!
“Do not say such things, Mañjuśrī,” the Blessed One replied
“If these monks had not heard this Dharma teaching
they would not have secured higher births for millions of eons, let alone meeting and serving any buddhas
Since they just listened to this Dharma teaching with doubt, they are right now dying and transmigrating from the Great Wailing Hell and being reborn among the gods in the Heaven of Joy
For sixty-eight eons, they will serve billions of thus-gone ones
In all these lives they will only take miraculous birth and become universal monarchs
In a later eon they will become thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect complete buddhas known as Vimalaprabhāsa.
Then, having heard the prophecy with their divine hearing
those gods, together with eighty thousand gods, traveled to where the Blessed One was
When they arrived, they scattered divine flowers all over Vaiśālī
They rejoiced in this Dharma teaching, saying
“Blessed One, we rejoice
Please cause the system of the awakening of the thus-gone ones to flourish!
The moment that they rejoiced in this way, they became irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Eighty-four thousand beings of the great city of Vaiśālī also became irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Twelve thousand beings removed the dust from the Dharma eye that sees all phenomena, rendering it stainless and pure.
The Blessed One continued to address Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, saying
“Mañjuśrī, since someone who listens to this Dharma teaching with doubt generates far greater merit than a bodhisattva who practices the six perfections without skillful means for one hundred thousand eons , why mention someone who has no doubt when they hear it
And why mention those who write it down, explain it, hold it, and teach it extensively to others
Therefore, Mañjuśrī, those who want to attain the state of a worthy one should train in this teaching
those who want to attain the state of a solitary buddha should train in this teaching, an
those who want to become a complete buddha who manifests unsurpassed and perfect awakening should train in this teaching.
The boy Ratnadatta then said to his mother
“Mother, please give me some food, and I will offer it to the Blessed One.
Ratnadatta’s mother filled a metal bowl with delicious food and gave it to the child
Ratnadatta then addressed the Blessed One, saying
“Blessed One, since it is true that all phenomena are inexhaustible, may the food in this metal bowl not diminish until the entire saṅgha of monks has been satisfied.
Ratnadatta filled the Blessed One’s alms bowl first and then addressed the saṅgha of monks, saying
“Venerable Ones, may these alms be accepted out of compassion for me by someone who can ensure that I obtain a great result
May these alms be accepted by someone who does not purify the gift with the body, who does not purify it with the mind
someone who will not generate merit or ripen karma when it is offered to them
someone who has no physical, verbal, or mental karma
someone who abides neither in the conditioned nor in the unconditioned
someone who is not stained by the qualities of ordinary beings
someone who does not rely upon the teachings of the hearers
someone who is not skilled in the vehicle of the buddhas
and someone who has no wish to be skilled in it!
No one in the saṅgha of monks took up the bowl
so the child Ratnadatta continued, “Venerable Ones, I wish to make a gift, and you also wish to eat
I do not expect anything in return from you venerable ones, so please eat
If it is true that my buddha realm will have a display of qualities that is a billion times greater than the display of qualities present in the buddha realms of billions of bodhisattvas who are of the same stature as Mañjuśrī, an
if it is true that what I have spoken is the truth, then by these true statements may all your bowls be filled from this metal bowl, an
may this bowl never be emptied!
All the alms bowls of the saṅgha of monks were then filled
The child Ratnadatta fed the entire population of Vaiśālī with delicious food, an
even then the alms did not run out
Then the Blessed One addressed the child Ratnadatta, saying
“Ratnadatta, these five are a bodhisattva’s purification of a gift
not apprehending a body, not apprehending a mind, having no attachment to the gift, not desiring any ripening, and no ripening for the recipients
Moreover, Ratnadatta, a bodhisattva should always manifest the following four things
the meditative concentration of emptiness, recollecting the Buddha, great compassion, and the ripening of one’s own karma.
The Blessed One addressed Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, saying
“Mañjuśrī, in thirty eons, this child Ratnadatta will become a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening
He will appear in the world as a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, learned and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed charioteer who tames beings, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha called Amogha­bala­kīrti
Those who gather in his retinue will be infinite in number, an
all of them will be bodhisattvas who do not regress
They will be infinitely radiant and have immeasurable lifespans.
Mañjuśrī then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teaching
How should it be remembered?
The Blessed One replied
“You should remember it as Teaching the Practice of a Bodhisattva, o
you can also remember it as A Being Born from Reality.
After the Blessed One and the saṅgha of monks had eaten their alms they went on their way, an
after the Blessed One had said this
the bodhisattva Ratnadatta, the entire retinue, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the Blessed One’s words
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “Teaching the Practice of a Bodhisattva.
It was translated, edited, and finalized by the Indian scholars Jinamitra and Prajñāvarman and the chief editor-translator Bandé Yeshé Dé and others

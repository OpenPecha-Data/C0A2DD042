A Sukhāvatī Prayer and Aspiration From the Pure Vision Net of Wisdom
Namo guru! 1
oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ hrīḥ
Emaho!
In the pure land of bliss in the west,
Is the protector of beings, Buddha Amitābha,
And the noble Saṅgha assembly of emanated bodhisattvas—
To all of you I pray with unbearably intense and fervent longing!
When the time of my death eventually arrives,
May I be taken directly by the hand,
Just like Tsogyal and Yönten Gönpo,
And guided to the realm of bliss!
oṃ amitābha hrīḥ

Prayer to the Lineage of the Supreme Hayagrīva Emanation from the Aural Transmission
Amitābha, original Buddha within the Blissful realm,
Perfect sambhogakāya, glorious and mighty Hayagrīva,
And Nāgārjuna, the accomplished vidyādhara—
To you I pray: exterminate the forces of Māra!
Padma Gyalpo, who brought appearance and existence under control,
Dongak Lingpa, 1 to whom the aural transmission was transmitted,
And the lineage for supreme beings entrusted with this Dharma—
To you I pray: exterminate the forces of Māra!
The yidam deity, mighty and supreme emanation Hayagrīva,
Ḍākinīs, dharmapālas, wealth deities, treasure-keepers and the rest,
All who belong to the infinite maṇḍalas of Lotus Speech—
To you I pray: exterminate the forces of Māra!
By awakening the ground potential and traversing the path,
May appearance and existence arise in their original purity. 2
May we realize the intent of the three neighs of the horse,
And actualise the fruition of the supreme Hayagrīva emanation.

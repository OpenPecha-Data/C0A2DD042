Prayer to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgön Kongtrul and Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Guru Mañjughoṣa, Khyentse Wangpo,
Supreme sovereign of the seven wondrous transmissions,
Pema Ösel Do-ngak Lingpa —
To you I pray with unwavering and heartfelt devotion.
The one who effortlessly accomplished all the activity
Of your enlightened body, speech, mind and qualities
And who was prophesied as an emanation of Lochen Vairotsana—
Lodrö Gyatso, at your feet I pray.
One who received the supreme attainment of Mañjuśrīghoṣa,
Who holds the sacred Dharma treasuries of kama and terma,
And who teaches others with great intelligence —
Gracious Guru, at your feet I pray!
From now until I attain enlightenment,
May you accept and care for me in all my lives to come.
And may I perfect the qualities of the paths and bhūmis,
And swiftly reach the level of the four-kāya guru.

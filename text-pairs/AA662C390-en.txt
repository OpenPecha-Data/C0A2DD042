Wisdom Nexus: A Guru Sādhana
Āḥ
The essence, primordially pure, is the dharmakāya;
The nature, spontaneously present, is the saṃbhogakāya;
And responsiveness, naturally arising, is the nirmāṇakāya—
This, my own awareness in which the three kāyas are already perfect,
Is the self-arisen, ultimate Padmasambhava,
Who has always been one with me, beyond joining and separation.
All that I see and hear is the play of the wisdom nature.
The marks of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are liberated in their own place.
Clear light is the naturally arisen genuine condition.
The enclosure beyond deliberate effort, acceptance or rejection,
Unsought, original perfection, wherein beings' welfare is accomplished.
Self-arising pure awareness: emaho!

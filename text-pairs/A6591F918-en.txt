The Beautiful Garland of Lotuses A Prayer to the Lineage of the Rediscovered Treasure, Five-Deity Subjugative Hayagrīva
Dharmakāya teacher, Samantabhadra, Unchanging Light,
Sambhogakāya, Great Compassionate One, Lotus Master of the Dance,
And nirmāṇakāya vidyādhara, Padmasambhava,
To you I pray: eliminate all disease and harmful influences!
Kharchen Za Yeshe Tsogyal, who gained unfailing mnemonic powers,
Vairotsana, who possesses the eyes of primordial wisdom,
And the great emanated tertön Chokden Gönpo, 1
To you I pray: eliminate all disease and harmful influences!
Emanation of Tri Songdetsen, Pema Do-ngak Lingpa, 2
Vairocana in person, Lodrö Thayé, 3
And the accomplished vidyādhara, Nangdzé Dorje, 4
To you I pray: eliminate all disease and harmful influences!
Noble root guru, who communicates the points of maturation and liberation,
The yidam, the five subjugative deities of Hayagrīva,
And ḍākinīs, dharmapālas, wealth deities and treasure-keepers,
To you I pray: eliminate all disease and harmful influences!
Through the yoga of approach and accomplishment and recitation of the generation phase,
May we pacify past karma, immediate circumstances, illness, harmful influences and obstacles,
And through the perfection stage of transforming the five poisons into wisdom,
May we perfect the strength of awareness and accomplish the great Awesome One!

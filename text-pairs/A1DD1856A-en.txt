Prayer for the Long Life of the Sixteenth Karmapa 1
Oṃ svasti!
The sixth guide of this Fortunate Aeon 2
And nirmāṇakāya emanation of the mahāsiddha Saraha,
Sixteenth in the garland of rebirths of Düsum Khyenpa,
Rigpé Dorje, may your lotus feet remain secure!
With knowledge, you see the nature of phenomena just as it is,
With love, you provide protection to all wandering beings,
And with power, you are the Karmapa, victorious over māras—
Rigpé Dorje, may your lotus feet remain secure!
With the light of activity sprung from the full maṇḍala of twofold accumulation,
You cause the jasmine grove of the Victorious One’s teachings to grow,
You who are a sublime moon among exponents of sacred Dharma—
Rigpé Dorje, may your lotus feet remain secure!
Preceptor of a hundred thousand possessors of multifaceted ethics,
Father of ten million bodhisattva heirs to the victors,
Great master of vidyādharas beyond count—
Rigpé Dorje, may your lotus feet remain secure!
You have planted the victory banner of the teachings in this world,
The flag of your renown now flutters in each and every direction,
And you uphold the activity of the victorious ones—Karmapa,
Rigpé Dorje, may your lotus feet remain secure!
A propagator of the teachings of the Lord of Sages,
And a guardian of beings in this degenerate age,
You are the Karmapa, emanation of Lokeśvara—
Rigpé Dorje, may your lotus feet remain secure!
Through the truth of unfailing Three Jewels
And through the blessings of the hosts of long-life deities
Who grant the supreme boon of immortality in particular,
May this prayer be fulfilled according to our aspirations!

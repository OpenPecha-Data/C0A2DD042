A Method of Confessing and Pledging through the Four Powers
Unequalled guide, king of the Śākyas,
Vajra Essence who Utterly Subdues
And the remainder of the thirty-five buddhas, together with the seven heroic sugatas,
Eight tathāgatas, protectors in this time of degeneration,
Thousand sun-like sages, guides for the Fortunate Aeon,
Dīpaṃkara, lord of sages, protector Maitreya,
And others—buddhas of the three times, together with your heirs,
We pay homage to you, make offerings and sincerely take refuge:
Protect us from the lower realms and threats of existence!
Victorious buddhas of every place and time,
And great compassionate bodhisattva warriors,
Consider me with your loving wisdom minds.
Throughout beginningless time until now,
Overpowered by the three poisons, I have committed the five boundless crimes,
And ten unwholesome actions, plundered the property of the Three Jewels,
And carried out acts that lead to rebirth in fearsome destinies
And inopportune states—both naturally negative deeds
And those that involve an infringement of the rules.
I have committed, requested and rejoiced at such acts.
With regret and remorse, I openly acknowledge all, withholding nothing.
Anxiously, I join my palms together before these great protectors,
Expressing devotion and respect physically, verbally and mentally.
And sincerely and repeatedly, I offer this confession:
In your loving wisdom, forgive these wrongs, I pray!
Supreme remedy in deprivation, most excellent, unfailing refuge,
Bliss-gone buddhas of the three times together with your heirs,
With the utmost devotion, I join my palms together and pledge:
That which leads to the various miseries and all that is unwished for
In the lower realms, evil destinies and eight inopportune states
Is non-virtuous action—downfalls and harmful deeds of body, speech and mind,
So from this moment on, I shall refrain from the slightest non-virtue,
Even at the cost of my own life—this is my commitment!

Brief Prayer of Offering to Gesar
Decree-holder of the teachings of Padmākara, knower of the three times,
Whose powers, strengths and miraculous activities are equal to the limits of space,
Protector of the Buddha’s teachings by means of the four activities,
Dzamling Sengchen Gyalpo, ‘Great Leonine King of this World’, to you I make offerings!

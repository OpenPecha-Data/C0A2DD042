Prayer to the Sovereign of Dharma and Retinue
Sovereign of Dharma, Buddha BhagavƒÅn,
Your eight close heart-sons, the bodhisattvas,
And the sixteen great and noble elders,
Turn your attention towards me, inspire me with your blessings.
Free me from all diseases, harmful spirits and obstructors,
And accomplish great benefit for the teachings and sentient beings.
Cause the qualities of experience and realization to increase in me,
And inspire me with your blessings so that I may seize the stronghold of bliss!

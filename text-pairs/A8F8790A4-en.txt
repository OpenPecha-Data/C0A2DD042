Aspiration for Electric Lamps
Bright like the light of the sun and the moon,
Dispelling darkness without burning smells or smoke,
This electric lamp, so clean and charming,
I offer with respect to the buddhas and their heirs.
Within the expanse of dharmadhātu, empty and clear,
The light of wisdom blazes forth, undiluted and pure.
May this electric light, conjured by the mystery of samādhi,
Vanquish all ignorance, the root of cyclic existence.

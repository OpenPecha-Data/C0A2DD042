Brief Dhāraṇī of Glorious Vajraṇakhī
Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and wrathful Vajraṇakhī: to you I pay homage, in you I take refuge!
All illness, harmful influences,
Difficult circumstances, obstacles,
Malicious intentions and violent actions,
All hostile enemies of the rulers and people of this land,
All hostile enemies of our paternal relatives and siblings, maternal relatives and siblings,
Male and female friends, brothers-in-law, nephews and nieces, servants, and neighbours, are eliminated through this vidyā-mantra!
They are struck with the kīla!
Pounded with the hammer!
And suppressed beneath the seal!
namaḥ samanta buddhānāṃ kāya vāk citta vajrāṇāṃ | oṃ gha gha ghātaya ghātaya sarvaduṣṭān māraya |
Contrived by enemies of the past,
Plotted by enemies of the future,
And fomented by enemies of the present, like howling dogs—they are all suppressed! Māraya bad phaṭ phaṭ!
kīli kīlaya sarvapāpān hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ | vajrakīli kīlaya vajradharoājñāpayati kāya vāk cittaṃ kīli kīlaya hūṃ phaṭ | oṃ akrodhe kamudgara hūṃ phaṭ | oṃ vajrakrodha mahābala hana daha paca vidhvaṃsaya jaṭilambodari ucchuṣma krodha hūṃ phaṭ ||
Awesome Vajraṇakhī, Vajra Claw,
In your wrathful form, you revel in infinite bliss,
And passionately embrace your wrathful consort.
Glorious ḍākinī in all your splendour—to you I pay homage and offer praise!

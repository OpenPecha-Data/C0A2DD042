In Praise of the Three Jewels
To Buddha the foremost, I pay homage!
To the Dharma that protects, I pay homage!
To the great Saṅgha, I pay homage!
To these three, I offer continuous veneration!
You have perfectly amassed the two great stores and accomplished fourfold wisdom 1 and the three kāyas;
You lack conceptual thought but know everything with perfect clarity;
You possess the sky-like dharmakāya and beautiful form kāyas—
To the Buddha, who is like a wish-granting tree, I pay homage!
The twelve branches of excellent teaching are causally concordant with dharmatā;
The Dharma has no arising or ceasing; it is devoid of conceptual elaboration;
Focusing on this, all qualities are accomplished—
To the sacred Dharma, the cause of excellence, I pay homage!
With afflictive obscurations and cognitive obscurations
Gradually eliminated through their remedies, you abide on the bhūmis,
Bring benefit to sentient beings, and purify buddha-realms—
To the great and noble Saṅgha, I pay homage!

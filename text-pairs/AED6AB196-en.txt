A Prayer for the Spread of Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche’s Termas
Oṃ svasti!
The great tertön, the majestic Vajradhara, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche,
Revealed an excellent and most supreme path – profound treasures possessed of the four modes of liberation. 1
May they spread far and wide throughout the entire world and all hidden lands,
Endure long into the future, and bring spontaneous benefit for both self and other.

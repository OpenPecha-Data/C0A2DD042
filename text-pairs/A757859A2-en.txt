The Seven Lines that Dispel All Obstacles and Enfold All Profundity
Bestower of all blessings, the Lotus-Born, Padmākara;
Lord of all accomplishments, the iṣṭadevatā, mighty Hayagrīva;
Fulfiller of all activities, the ḍākinī Vajrayoginī 1 ;
Dispeller of all obstacles, the guardians, male and female;
To you we pray. Dispel all our obstacles!
Accomplish all our wishes, just as we desire!
Let virtue and goodness rain upon us, now and forever!

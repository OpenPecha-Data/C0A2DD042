A Shower of Great Bliss A Prayer to the Lineage of the Vajrasattva Guru Yoga
The ground’s all-pervading space—awareness—is Samantabhadra; from its radiance arises
The ground’s appearance—the union—emanating clouds of deities of the five families.
To the conquerors who possess the mind-direct transmission that pervades space
I pray: grant the supreme empowerment of dharmakāya!
Lord Garab Dorje, dancing the dance of supreme bliss,
Mañjuśrīmitra and the mahāsiddha Śrī Siṃha—
To the gurus of the sign transmission of the mighty vidyādharas
I pray: shower down the great resplendence of saṃbhogakāya!
Lake-Born Vajra, Vimalamitra,
And the emanated beings for whom they cared: the king and subjects, translators and scholars—
To the gurus of the oral transmission who hold the authoritative words of the pith instructions
I pray: awaken the primordial wisdom of nirmāṇakāya !
Longchenpa, pioneer of the teachings of the supreme vehicle,
And Jigme Lingpa, who was the illusory net of his three secrets:
To my root gurus, universal embodiments of wisdom,
I pray: grant the accomplishment of ripening and liberation!
Bless me so that I may posses the four immeasurables, perfect the two bodhicittas,
Ripen my mind through the four empowerments and actualize the four paths.
Bless me, so that through the four phases of approach and accomplishment, I traverse the paths of the four vidyādhara levels,
And attain the fruition of the four kāya s!

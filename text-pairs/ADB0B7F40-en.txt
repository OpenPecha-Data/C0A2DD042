Prayer for the Long Life of Soktsé Rinpoche
Om svasti! You who hold the treasury of Samantabhadra’s wisdom mind teachings,
And ardently raise the victory banner of study and practice in this degenerate age—
Glorious lama, may your life be secure for a hundred aeons,
And may all be splendid and auspicious for the benefit of self and others to be spontaneously fulfilled!

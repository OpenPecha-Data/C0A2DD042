Short Maṇḍala Offering
All my own and others’ possessions and positive actions, accumulated in the past, present and future,
And clouds of offerings that fill the infinite realms of the three kāyas, 1
We imagine now and offer to the glorious teacher:
Accept them, and grant us the accomplishments, ordinary and supreme!
oṃ guru buddha bodhisatva ratna maṇḍala pūja megha samudra spharaṇa samaye āḥ hūṃ

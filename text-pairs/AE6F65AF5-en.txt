Summoning the Spirit of Abundance: A Rain of Flowers from the Treasury of the Symbolic Scripts of the Profound and Secret Ḍākinī
Hūṃ! Here within the fence of auspiciousness and perfect abundance,
Materials of abundance and sensory enjoyments are amassed like clouds.
Noble Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, gurus, devas and ḍākinīs,
And vast, ocean-like gathering of Dharma protectors, wealth deities and treasure guardians—
Send down a great shower of siddhis and abundance-spirit, here and now!
Indestructibility—the wealth of the vajra body,
Freedom from obstruction—the wealth of the vajra speech,
And absence of delusion—the wealth of the vajra mind,
Bestow them now upon our own and others’ body, speech, and mind!
The wealth of the dharmakāya, primordially free from transference,
The wealth of the saṃbhogakāya, endowed with the seven aspects of union,
And the wealth of the nirmāṇakāya, the illusory play of rigpa’s expression,
Let them all converge within this expanse of mind encompassing saṃsāra and nirvāṇa!
In the original condition, pure from the beginning, and free from grasping at characteristics,
To abide by an experience of natural rest, in which all is left as it is, primordially empty—
For us Dzogchen yogins who meditate on self-liberation,
Confer the wealth of the five kāyas, the unity of basic space and wisdom!
Within the relative domain, arising through the interdependence of cause and effect,
The riches of all that is desirable and most excellent in this world—
The powerful wish-fulfilling jewel, the wish-granting tree,
The great treasure vase, the nectar of the gods,
The harvest that needs no toil, and the seven precious substances—
We summon the spirit of all these excellent riches!
The spirit of stability possessed by the supreme central mountain,
The spirit of inexhaustible increase found in the seven frolicking seas,
The spirit of splendour from the seven perfectly arranged golden mountains,
And the spirit of flourishing bliss and happiness within the four continents—
We summon them here! Let them dissolve into these substances of accomplishment!
The spirit of monasteries and their blessed supports of body, speech, and mind,
The spirit of great saṅgha gatherings of the learned and accomplished,
The spirit of reverence engendered by solemn speech and resolute thought,
The spirit of the king’s own treasury in which abundant riches are stored,
The spirit of ocean-like excellence and virtue within the world and its inhabitants—
By the truth of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, let them all be gathered here!
Gurus, devas and ḍākinīs, and Guru Padmasambhava,
With one-pointed mind, we place all our hope in you and pray:
In the shorter term, may we not lack resources,
And may we find circumstances favourable for following our dharmic aspirations,
Then, ultimately, may we all easily arrive at the primordial state!

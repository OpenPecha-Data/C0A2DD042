Take refuge in the Saṅgha.

May you, and however many other blessed ones, tathāgatas, arhats, complete and perfect buddhas there are living and dwelling in all the world systems in all directions—all you blessed buddhas—please pay attention to me!
In this life and all my other lives circling from one form of saṃsāric existence to the next throughout beginningless time—whatever wrongs I may have done, or caused other to do, or have rejoiced in;
Whatever possessions of stūpas, possessions of the Saṅgha, or possessions of saṅghas dwelling in all directions, I may have appropriated, caused others to appropriate, or rejoiced in the appropriation of;
Whichever of the five actions of immediate retribution I may have committed, caused others to commit, or rejoiced in;
Whichever path of the ten unwholesome actions I may have embarked upon or am currently residing on, incited others to enter, or rejoiced in;
Whatever karmic veils I may have developed that would lead to the hells, or to the animal realm, or to the land of the pretas, or to birth in border regions, or amongst barbarians, or amongst the long-lived gods, or that would lead to incomplete sense faculties, or holding wrong views, or to not rejoicing at the advent of a Buddha—
All of these I confess in the presence of the blessed buddhas, who are aware, who observe, who are witnesses, who are authorities, who know and see. I admit them and do not conceal them, and I make a vow to refrain from them henceforth!
All you blessed buddhas, please pay attention to me!
Over the course of this life and all other lives in saṃsāra without beginning or end—whatever wholesomeness there may be from having given gifts to others, even as little as a mouthful of food to a being born as an animal;
Whatever wholesomeness there may be in having preserved discipline;
Whatever wholesomeness there may be in having maintained chaste behavior;
Whatever wholesomeness there may be in having caused sentient beings to mature;
Whatever wholesomeness there may be in having roused a mind set on supreme awakening;
Whatever wholesomeness there may be in unsurpassable wisdom—
Combining, gathering, and collecting all of this together, I dedicate it to the unexcelled, unsurpassed, most exalted, the most excellent; I dedicate it to unsurpassable, complete and perfect awakening.
Just as past blessed buddhas have dedicated, and just as future buddhas, blessed ones, will dedicate, and just as the buddhas, blessed ones of the present in all directions, are dedicating now, I also fully dedicate in the very same way.
I confess each and every misdeed.
I rejoice in all goodness.
I request and pray to all the buddhas to teach and remain in saṃsāra.
May I attain sublime, supreme, unsurpassed wisdom!
Supreme among humans, Victors now present,
Those of the past, and those yet to come,
Your praiseworthy qualities are boundless like the ocean—
With folded palms, I take refuge in you!

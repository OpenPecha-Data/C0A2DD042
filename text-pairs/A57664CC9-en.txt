Cymbals to Invoke a Compassionate Response A Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Khandro Tsering Chödrön
Lake Born Vajra Padmasambhava, the very face and embodiment of all the buddhas,
With the whole vast, infinite gathering of sources of refuge,
When I call on you, unwavering, in this heartfelt yearning melody,
Let this prayer of mine come true!
Appearance and emptiness indivisible, you appeared in the form of a wisdom ḍākinī,
And have long been inseparable from the lord of the maṇḍala,
Delighting in the dance of the innate nature—
Noble lady, “Lamp of Dharma”, to you I pray!
As the fresh, brilliant light fusing experience and realization
Arose in the profound and vast, sky-like expanse of your wisdom mind,
You appeared amidst the bright constellations of the ḍākinīs of the three spheres,
As the highest, most exalted of all—to you I pray!
Arising from the great elements of virtue and goodness,
You appeared like the great disc of the full moon,
But now that the light of virtue is obscured by the darkness of the five degenerations,
Suddenly, you have set to the West 1 —how could this be?
So, with all the radiance of the auspicious signs of a ḍākinī,
May your rebirth swiftly appear, like the new rising sun
That dawns over the eastern mountains of the teachings and beings,
And makes the thousand petalled lotus of virtue and goodness burst into bloom.

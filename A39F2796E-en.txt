Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
When the Bhagavān was travelling in the land of Vṛji, he went to the great city of Vaiśālī, together with a large saṅgha of one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikṣus and a vast number of bodhisattva mahāsattvas
At that time, he came across an old woman from the city gathering grass in the countryside. She was decrepit and had reached the end of her life-span, being one hundred and twenty years old
The woman saw the Bhagavān coming from afar—handsome, inspiring, with senses tamed, mind tamed, endowed with supreme discipline and serenity, guarded, faultless, senses controlled, pure and clear like the sea, unclouded, upright like a golden sacrificial post, radiant with splendor clear and distinct, wonderfully adorned with the thirty-two signs of a great being
bowed her head at his feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān three times and sat to one side. Bowing with her palms together in the direction of the Bhagavān, the woman then asked hi
O Bhagavān, where does birth come from
Where does aging come from
Where do they go
O Bhagavān, where does sickness come from
Where does death come from
O Bhagavān, where does form come from
Where do sensation, notions, formative factors and consciousness come from
O Bhagavān, where does the earth element come from
Where do the water element, the fire element, the wind element, the space element and the element of consciousness come from
O Bhagavān, where does the eye come from
Where do the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind come from
The Bhagavān replie
Sister, birth does not come from anywhere
Aging does not come from anywhere
They do not go anywhere
Sister, sickness does not come from anywhere
Death does not come from anywhere
Sister, form does not come from anywher
Sensation, notions, formative factors and consciousness do not come from anywhere
Sister, the earth element does not come from anywhere
The water element, the fire element, the wind element, the space element and the element of consciousness do not come from anywhere
Sister, the eye does not come from anywhere
The ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind do not come from anywhere
Sister, it is as follows
as an analogy, a fire arises based on a stick to rub with, a stick to rub on, and and also a person’s effort to generate it
That fire, moreover, once it has burnt the grass and wood, will have no more causes and will die
Sister, where do you think the fire comes fro
where does it go
She answere
O Bhagavān, that fire comes into being owing to the power of a collection of causes
It ceases and dies when it lacks the collection of causes
The Bhagavān sai
Sister, likewise, all phenomena come into being owing to the power of a collection
Sister, likewise, all phenomena come into being owing to the power of a collection
They cease and die when they lack the collection
Whatever the phenomena, they do not come from anywhere, nor do they go anywhere
Sister, it is as follow
although the eye consciousness arises based upon the eye and for
the eye consciousness does not have a produce
nor has it anything that makes it cease
Nowhere is it brought together at all
The aggregates do not come from anywher
nor do they go anywher
When one has accumulated karma through the conditions of the consciousnesse
the fruits manifest as the results of three types in the three realm
That fruit is empty to
It has no going
It has no coming
No one makes it arise
It is not stopped by anybody
Sister, all phenomena are inherently stopped
Likewise, although the mental consciousness arises based upon the ear and sound, the nose and smell, the tongue and taste, the body and touch, and the mind and phenomena, the mental consciousness does not have a produce
When one has accumulated karma through the condition of mental consciousness, the fruits manifest as the results of three types in the three realms
That fruit is empty too. It has no coming. It has no going. No one makes it arise. It is not stopped by anybody
Sister, it is as follow
nor does it dwell in the stic
neither does it dwell in the hid
The sound does not dwell in the woo
sound of a drum arises based on wood, hide and a stick, and also on a person’s effort to make it arise
The past sound of that drum was empty, the future sound will be empty and the sound that arises at present is empt
nor does it dwell in the person’s hand
However, because of these conditions, it is termed sound
That which is termed sound is also empty
It has no coming
Sister, likewise, all phenomena depend solely on condition
i.e., ones such as ignorance, craving, karma and consciousness
When these latter phenomena are present, the terms death and birth are designated
That which is designated death and birth is also empty
That which is designated death and birth is also empty
It has no coming. It has no going. No one makes it arise. It is not stopped by anybody
Sister, all phenomena are inherently stopped
Sister, in this way, whoever understands the nature of a drum’s sound well also understands emptiness well
Whoever understands emptiness well, understands nirvāṇa well
Whoever understands nirvāṇa wel
has no attachment to any entity, and despite designating conventional things with all sorts of term
‘this is mine,’ or ‘that is me,
or ‘sentient being,’ or ‘life force,’ or ‘living being,’ or ‘man,’ or ‘person,
or ‘born of Manu,’ or ‘son of Manu,
or ‘agent,’ or ‘inciter of action,’ or ‘appropriator,
or ‘discarder’—he teaches Dharma without attachment to these
He teaches Dharma well
He teaches the final reality. He teaches the final reality well
Sister, it is as follows: an artist or an artist’s apprentice spreads various paints on a canvas that has been thoroughly cleane
or on a flat piece of wood or on the surface of a wall that has been wiped clean
He paints with ease whatever bodily shape he might wis
such as the features of a man’s physical for
the features of a woman’s physical for
the features of an elephant’s physical for
the features of a horse’s physical for
or the features of a donkey’s physical for
That which is designated form is also empty
Sister, all phenomena are inherently stopped
Sister, it is likewise when there are meritorious formative factors
That is to say, although bodies conducive to merit might result amongst gods and humans
in that case not even an atom is transferred from this world to the world beyond
However, due to the formative factors, there are various kinds of rebirths
They are represented as physical bodies with their bases of cognition
It is likewise when there are demeritorious formative factors
not even an atom is transferred in such a case from this world to the world beyond
However, due to the formative factors there are various kinds of rebirths
They are understood to be physical forms with their bases of cognition
Sister, it is as follows: as an analogy, a vast gathering of clouds arises because of the nāga-power of the nāga
and when those huge nets of clouds cover the earth they let fall a heavy deluge of rai
After the heavy deluge of rain has fallen, the hills and the valleys are quenched
Sister, it is likewise when there are meritorious formative factor
that is to say, when meritorious bodies result amongst gods or humans
That is to say, although bodies that are not meritorious result amongst hell beings, or in the animal state, or in the world of the Lord of Death, or among the demigods
It is likewise, too, when there are demeritorious formative factors
When she saw him, faith grew in her mind. Then full of devotion she approached the Bhagavān
That is to say, although bodies that are not meritorious result amongst hells beings or in the animal state or the world of the Lord of Death or among the demigods
in such cases the activity of the formative factor is empty, the agent of the formative factor is empty and the fruits of the formative factor are also empty
Why is this so
and the consciousness which reincarnates amongst the beings of the formless realms is empty to
That on account of which the consciousness reincarnates amongst beings of the formless realms is empt
Sister, when there are formative factors for remaining static, consciousness will reincarnate amongst the beings of the formless realms
Sister, it is because all phenomena are empty of essence
Even so phenomena are designated
The learned are not attached to them
As they have no attachment they do not dispute
Having no disputes is the supreme quality of the religious mendicant
The woman sai
Since the Bhagavān has taught the profound Dharma in this way, O Bhagavā
I have no doubts
I, too, have penetrated these teachings with the eye of wisdom and will never be of two minds about them again
Now I am ol
O Bhagavān, earlier, as I hadn’t yet heard these teachings I did have doubts
I am decrepi
I suffe
I am poo
I have no protecto
I have no life and yet I do not die
O Bhagavān, after hearing these teaching
I am freed from the notion of a self
I realize that there is no aging, no poverty, no happiness, no sickness, nor is anyone ever ill, wealthy or poor at all
Bhagavān, why have you taught such a profound Dharma discourse as this
Then the Venerable Ānanda inquired of the Bhagavā
I wonder whether it is because this woman, who has investigated so well in this way, is meritorious, learned and naturally wise
The Bhagavān replie
Ānanda, so it is
Ānanda, it is indeed just as you say
This woman is meritorious, learned and naturally wise
Ānanda, this woman was my mother for five hundred lifetimes
Ānanda, in each of those lifetimes I also generated the roots of virtue so she could attain unsurpassable and perfectly complete enlightenment
Ānanda, I cherished, revered and respected this woman greatly
Bhagavān, why is she so poor in this way
Ānanda inquire
She, too, thought, ‘I will engage in whatever conduct my son engages in and attain the unsurpassable and perfectly complete enlightenment of the vehicle of happiness
The Bhagavān answered, “Ānanda, when I took up the conduct of a bodhisattva, I became a renunciate in the doctrine of the Bhagavān, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Krakucchanda
At that time, Ānanda, this woman was my mother
Because of her attachment she did not want to let me go, so I stopped eating my one meal per day
Later, she agreed to let me go
Ānanda, it is because of the ripening of that karma that she is as poor as she is
Ānanda, this is the last time she will be poor
Once born there, she will make offerings to an innumerable, immeasurable, inconceivable number of buddha
Ānanda, after death, this woman, who no longer craves a woman’s faculties, will obtain a man’s faculties in the Sukhāvatī buddhafield of the bhagavān, the perfectly complete buddha Amitābha
guide an innumerable, immeasurable, inconceivable number of sentient beings to enlightenmen
make an innumerable, immeasurable, inconceivable number of sentient beings ripe for enlightenmen
bring an innumerable, immeasurable, inconceivable number of sentient beings to enlightenmen
Ānanda, the wealth and enjoyments of sentient beings of this buddha field will be like those of the gods of the Thirty-Three
and having brought an innumerable, immeasurable, inconceivable number of sentient beings to enlightenment, in six million eight hundred thousand kalpas she will become the Tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha named Bodhyaṅga­puṣpa­kara in this trichiliocosm
Ānanda, behold this old lady
Before me with palms joine
and having spoken these word
Thus did the Bhagavān announc
the Sugata, the Teacher, added the following verse
Who will become a buddha, excellent among humans, Named Bodhyaṅga­puṣpa­kar
She, giving up a woman’s for
Will go to the realm of Sukhāvatī
Venerate the victor Amitāyu
And become a peerless buddha, conqueror of the three realms
She will become a peerless buddha, excellent among humans
Venerating, too, the many guides Who dwell in other worlds, The great sages who benefit those realm
Having also heard the Dharma from them al
With a purified mind, she will become accomplished in the same fashion
Remaining in the immovable, supreme mind of enlightenmen
She will cause‌ countless sentient beings to practice the Dharma
At that time there will be no inferior being
No beings with various bad bodies or bad colo
None dull, lame, and likewise none blind, And no lepers with stumps for arms
At that time the sun and moon, fire, lightning, and gems Will no longer be what shine
For the guide Bodhyaṅga­puṣpa­kara’s mighty light Will everywhere be all-illuminating
There will be no women belonging to Māra’s factio
No female māras, no retinue of Māra
The same stature, marks, and complexion As those of the supreme gods of the Thirty-Three Will be natural to those beings who at that time Will fill that exceptional buddhafield
When the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma ther
Even the word ‘tīrthika’ will be unknow
Even the words ‘the lower realms,’ ‘The pretas,’ ‘animal birth,’ ‘the beings of hell,’ And even the word ‘woman,’ will ever stay unheard
All will be endowed with a complete mind of enlightenmen
At that time, there will be no classifications of vehicles, Like the vehicles of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas in this worl
This completes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra, The Questions of an Old Lady
The translation was made, edited, and approved by the Indian preceptors Jinamitra and Dānaśīla and the chief editor and translator Bandé Yeshé Dé
Dwell in loving-kindness, and be compassionate
As birth in that buddhafield will always be miraculous, Everyone there will be free from birth in the womb
They will remember past lives and, supremely intelligent and learned, Retain on hearing it whatever excellent teachings they study
Such are the qualities arrayed as features of that realm That, even by speaking of them for eons at a time, The tiny fraction of them one could thus describe Would be less than a single drop of water compared to the ocean
When the Bhagavān had spoke
the venerable Ānanda and the old lad
the bodhisattvas and bhikṣu
the world with its gods, humans, demigods and gandharvas all rejoice
praised highly what the Bhagavān had taugh
with complete limbs, parts of limbs and all the sense faculties
Well executed though the painting may be, it does not involve any phenomenon at all being transferred from the artist’s hand or mind to the physical form depicted; and yet we designate that form as a result of those conditions
When the hills and valleys are quenched, the rain later subsides
But these things do not originate from the nāgas’ bodies or minds
The nāgas produced the vast gathering of clouds by virtue of the nāga-powers of nāgas alone

May all negativities be purified, accumulation of merit fully flourish
And may the special good qualities Arising from the sermons of each bhagavān be accomplished
Prostrations to all the Three Jewels in the ten directions
I praise and glorify them, behold and discern them
I constantly offer and venerate, unceasingly until the end of time, all of the Three Jewels that have not been, are not now, nor ever will be relinquished. I make Dharma offerings, as well as a variety of offerings comparable to the incomparable, that arise from the infinite merit of the bodhisattvas, and are exalted, foremost, holy, special, noble, supreme and unsurpassable, comparable to the incomparable, and that completely fill the entire world of the ten directions
Having offered these, please accept them. I shall venerate, honor, respect and please you
I shall not hide, shall not conceal, and shall not fail to acknowledge them
Then, at that time, all negativities will be purified, and all merit will be completely accomplished
I purify and dispel them, examine them and cast them out
Not holding back even the most trifling, I avow and confess the sins and nonvirtuous actions that contradict all holy scripture and that I myself have committed in this life or while wandering in the three worlds through beginningless, endless births, or that I caused others to perform, or even that I rejoiced in when performed by others. They are: the ten nonvirtues of body, speech, and mind that were committed under the influence of desire, anger, and ignorance; the five heinous crimes and so forth
May I never lean toward nor perform wrong, nonvirtuous actions
From this time until the essence of enlightenment is reached, in every future life, may I never fall into inferior hindering births, such as birth in the three lower realms, excepting only emanations for the benefit of others
May I never lean toward nor accumulate the causes of karma and defilements
After being completely freed from results, such as suffering and a contemptible body, may I never again experience them
From this time until the essence of enlightenment is reached, may the virtues of my body, speech, and mind continue as unceasingly as a stream
In whatever life I might be born, may I possess magnificent happiness and joy
and attain the ability and power to work for the benefit of all sentient beings
From this time until the essence of enlightenment is reached, I take refuge in the Three Jewels. I offer them my body; may each of the greatly compassionate ones forever accept i
May I never lose or disregard the thought of enlightenment, and never be separated from noble spiritual masters
So likewise, I whose name is …, do also generate the thought of enlightenment from this time until the essence of enlightenment is reached
Just as the buddhas of the three times rejoiced in unsurpassable merit, I whose name is…. also rejoice in all worldly and beyond-worldly meri
When the time of death is certain, may I directly behold the holy faces of all those buddhas and bodhisattvas
and when they extend their golden right hands and place them upon my head, may I receive a prophecy
And may I die with my mind undeluded by defilements, with aspirations that accord with the selfless dharmas, and with limitless thought of enlightenment
For the purpose of liberating all beings without exception, May I swiftly reach perfect enlightenment
n short: After purifying all habitual tendencies without exception, I will completely accomplish the two accumulations of merit and wisdom
This completes Calling Witness with a Hundred Prostrations
As an omen of the arising of the holy Dharma in Tibet, during the reign of King Lha Thothori Nyanshal (lha tho tho ri snyan shal), this text descended from the sky into the palace Yumbu Lhakhar (yum bu bla mkhar). The king dreamed that after five generations it would be possible to understand the meaning of this text. Thus the holy Dharma began

may I fully understand it without mistake, meditate upon it, teach it to others without mistake, and guide them
The buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times, who are free of all things, who are comparable to selfless dharmas not comprised within the aggregates (skandha), domains (dhātu) or bases of cognition (āyatana), and who are unborn since beginningless time, generated the thought of enlightenment because of their nature of emptiness

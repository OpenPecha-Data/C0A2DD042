Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājgṛh
He was accompanied by his entire retinue, by immeasurable, countless bodhisattvas, and by gods and nāgas
They paid respect to the Blessed One and made offerings to hi
The Blessed One replie
“Kṣitigarbha, the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, has three bodie
At that time, the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, who was sitting among the retinue, rose from his sea
and asked, “Has the Blessed One a body?
a dharmakāya, a saṃbhogakāya and a nirmāṇakāy
Son of a noble family, the three bodies of the Tathāgata are these
the pure nature is the dharmakāy
pure meditative absorption is the saṃbhogakāy
and pure conduct is the nirmāṇakāya of all buddha
Son of a noble family, the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata consists in the fact that he has no nature, just like the sky
His saṃbhogakāya consists in the fact that he comes forth, just like a clou
His nirmāṇakāya consists in the activity of all the buddhas, the fact that it soaks everything, just like rai
The bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha then asked the Blessed On
How should one view this explanation on the three bodies of the Blessed One
The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbh
Son of a noble family, you should view the three bodies of the Tathāgata in the following wa
The dharmakāya should be viewed as that which is the essence of the Tathāgata
The saṃbhogakāya should be viewed as that which is the essence of the bodhisattva
The nirmāṇakāya should be viewed as that which is the essence of ordinary beings who conduct themselves devotedly
Son of a noble family, the dharmakāya remains the same nature for all the buddha
The saṃbhogakāya remains the same meditative absorption for all the buddha
The nirmāṇakāya remains the same awakened activity for all the buddha
Son of a noble family, the basis-of-all in its pure state is mirror-like wisdom, the dharmakāy
The afflicted mind in its pure state is the wisdom of equalit
Mental cognition in its pure state is discriminating wisdom, the saṃbhogakāy
The five sense cognitions in their pure state are all-accomplishing wisdom, the nirmāṇakāya
The bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha then exclaimed to the Blessed On
Blessed One, the noble Dharma that I have heard from the Blessed One is excellent, Sugata, really excellent
The Blessed One then declare
Son of a noble family, whoever fully upholds this Dharma discourse of the Blessed One will obtain merit that is immeasurable, inexpressible, incalculable and unfathomable
When the Blessed One had spoke
the world, including the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas rejoice
and praised the teachings of the Blessed One
This concludes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra, The Three Bodie

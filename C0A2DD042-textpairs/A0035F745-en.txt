Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was in the Realm of the Thirty-Three Gods
seated on the throne of Indra. With him were great hearers such as the venerable Aśvajit
bodhisattva mahāsattvas such as noble Maitreya, noble Avalokiteśvara, and Vajrapāṇi, who were adorned with immeasurable precious qualities
as well as various gods such as the great Brahmā, who is the lord of the Sahā world, Nārāyaṇa, the great Īśvara, Śakra, who is the chief of the gods, and Pañcaśikha, who is the king of the gandharvas
On that occasion, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara rose from his sea
and, having draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt down with his right knee on the peak of Mount Meru
His palms together, he then bowed toward the Blessed One and addressed to him these words
“Blessed One, these gods all really wish to build a stūpa
Now that they are present in this entourage
At this, the Blessed One spoke the verses of dependent arisin
ye dharmā hetuprabhavā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hy avadat teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃvādī mahā­śramaṇa
“All phenomena that arise from causes, The Tathāgata has taught their cause, And that which is their cessation; Thus has proclaimed the Great Renunciant
“Avalokiteśvara, it is like this
This dependent arising is the dharmakāya of all the tathāgatas
A person who sees dependent arising sees the Tathāgata
Avalokiteśvara, if a faithful son or daughter of a noble family builds, in a remote place, a stūpa the size of a gooseberry fruit
with a central pillar the size of a needle and a parasol the size of a flower of the bakula tree
and inserts this verse of dependent arising which is the dharmadhātu, he or she will generate the merit of Brahmā
When they pass on from there and die, they will be reborn with fortunes equaling those of the gods of the Pure Abodes
After the Blessed One had thus spoken
the hearers, bodhisattvas, the whole assembly, an
the universe of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised his words
This concludes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on Dependent Arising
Translated and edited by the Indian scholar Surendrabodhi and the principal editor and translator Venerable Yeshe Dé
When such persons pass on from here and die, they will be reborn in the world of Brahmā
please teach them the Dharma in such a way so that their merit of Brahmā will increase, and the merit of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will increase much more than that of all types of beings in the world of gods, māras, and Brahmā, including renunciants and brahmins

Prostrations to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Bhagavān was dwelling at the place of the nāga king Sāgara together with a great assembly of , bhikṣus as well as a multitude of bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas
At that time the Bhagavān said to the nāga king Sāgara
the bhikṣus and bodhisattvas rejoiced and greatly praised the teachings of the Bhagavān
This completes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra, “The Questions of the Nāga King Sāgara.
Translated and finalized by the Indian abbot Surendrabodhi and the senior editor-translator, the monk Yeshé Dé
When the Bhagavān had spoken in this way
“Lord of the nāgas, if one utters these four aphorisms of the Dharma, in uttering them one is expressing all , articles of the Dharma.
“To fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that all compounded phenomena are impermanent
to fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that all contaminated phenomena are suffering
to fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that all phenomena are without self
and to fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that nirvāṇa is peace

Homage to all buddhas and bodhisatvas
Thus I have heard at one time
The Bhagavān was residing at the grove of Anāthapiṇḍada in Jeta Wood in Śrāvastī together with a great assembly of monks and a great multitude of bodhisatvas
who desires beauty should cultivate patience
who desires knowledge should frequently practice appropriate mindfulness
who desires memory should not have excessive pride
who desires eloquence should pay respect to the guru
who desires liberation should abstain from all evil
who desires to make all beings happy should generate the mind for awakening
who desires a sweet voice should speak truthfully
who desires virtuous qualities should take joy in solitude
who desires the Dharma should attend to the spiritual friend
who desires quiescence should frequently practice no contact with others
who desires insight should frequently examine things as empty
who desires rebirth in the world of Brahmā should cultivate love, compassion, joy, and equanimity
who desires the abundant resources of gods and humans should behave in conformity with the path of ten virtuous actions
who desires complete nirvāṇa should take joy in empty dharmas
who desires to obtain all virtuous qualities should worship the Three Jewels.
This completes the Noble Mahāyāna sūtra, The Inquiry of Jayamati
Then, the Bhagavān addressed the bodhisatva Jayamati as follows
Jayamati, a faithful man or woman of a good famil
who desires merit should worship the Tathāgata
who desires discernment should be devoted to learning
who desires heavenly rebirth should uphold moral conduct
who desires wealth should increase charity
When the Bhagavān had spoken
the bodhisatva mahāsatva Jayamati
the complete assembly, and the world with its gods, humans, demigods and gandharvas rejoiced and highly praised what had been proclaimed by the Bhagavān

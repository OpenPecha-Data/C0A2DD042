Praise to Tārā with Twenty-One Verses of Homag
Homage to the honored, noble lady Tārā
Homage to Tārā, swift and gallant, Whose glance is instantaneous like lightning

You trample the seven worlds underfoot, And possess the strength to summon all
Homage to you, praised by Śakra, Agni, Brahmā, maruts, and Śiva
The hosts of bhūtas, vetālas, gandharvas, And yakṣas pay tribute to you
Homage to you, who with traṭ and phaṭ Crush the magical devices of other traditions
With your right leg bent and your left leg extended, You shine amid flames blazing wildly
Homage to Turā, the fearsome lady, Destroyer of the most powerful demons
With your lotus face and stern frown, You are the slayer of each and every foe
Homage to you, whose fingers grace your heart, Displaying the mudrā of the Three Jewels
Graced by wheels in all directions, Your natural radiance overwhelms all
Homage to you, supremely joyous, Your splendorous crown spreading garlands of light
Tuttārā, smiling and laughing, You bring demons and worlds within your control
Homage to you, who can summon The hosts of earthly guardians
Knitting your quivering brows, with the syllable hūṁ You deliver from every misfortune
Homage to you, so brightly adorned, With a sliver of moon as your crown
Your locks always graced by Amitābha, Whose bright light streams forever forth
Homage to you, seated amid blazing flames That resemble the fire that ends an eon
Immersed in joy, your right leg extends, and the left is bent
Thus, you crush legions of foes
Homage to you, who on the earth’s surface Strike your palms and stamp your feet
The hūṁ that is formed by your frown Smashes the seven netherworlds to nothing but dust

In perfect union with svāhā and oṁ, You lay to waste every terrible evil
Homage to you, who, immersed in rapture, Shatter the bodies of all foes
You shine with the knowledge-syllable hūṁ, As your mantra’s ten syllables are set forth
Homage to Turā, your feet stomping, Formed from the seed of the syllable hūṁ
The mountains of Meru, Mandara, and Vindhya, And all the three worlds—you cause them to quake
Homage to you, who hold in your hand A deer-marked moon like a divine lake
With tāra uttered twice and then with phaṭ, You eliminate all poisons
Homage to you, sovereign of divine hosts, Served by gods and kiṃnaras
Your resplendence, an armor of joy, Pacifies strife and clears away nightmares
Homage to you, whose two eyes shine brightly Like the sun and the moon when it’s full
Tuttārā, with twice-uttered hara, You pacify the most intractable ills
Homage to you, who have the power to pacify, You display the three true natures
Turā, supreme lady, you destroy The hordes of grahas, vetālas, and yakṣas
This praise by means of the root mantra— The twenty-one verses of homage Should be recited in earnest by the wise, Who are filled with devotion for the goddess
Recalling it at dusk and also when rising at dawn Will grant them freedom from every fear
It will pacify all misdeeds, And destroy all evil destinies
Soon they will receive empowerment From seven million conquerors
Beyond this, they shall attain greatness, And proceed to the ultimate state of buddhahood
If they recall this praise all dreadful poisons, Whether natural or manufactured, Whether eaten or imbibed, Will be utterly neutralized
This will dispel the heap of suffering Inflicted by grahas, infectious diseases, and poisons, Even in other beings
If chanted twice, thrice, or seven times, Those who want children will come to have them
Those who seek wealth will come to have that
Each and every wish will be fulfilled
And obstacles, entirely vanquished, will be no more
This completes the praise to the Blessed Tārā as spoken by the completely perfect Buddha

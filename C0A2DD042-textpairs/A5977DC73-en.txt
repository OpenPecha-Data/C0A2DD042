Thus did I hear at one time
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
The Bhagavān was dwelling in the Grove of Twin Sāl-Trees in the vicinity of the Malla town of Kuśinagara, together with a retinue of śrāvakas
Then, when the Bhagavān was about to pass into parinirvāṇa
he addressed the bhikṣus
Bhikṣus, you should train in this way
One should live with a virtuous spiritual friend, a virtuous companion, a virtuous support
One should not, however, live with a non-virtuous spiritual friend, a non-virtuous companion, a non-virtuous support
Bhikṣus, you should train thinking
Then, the venerable Ānanda spoke to the Bhagavān
Honorable One, having come here alone to a secluded place, I had gone into meditative retreat when the following thought arose in my mind
A virtuous spiritual friend, a virtuous companion, a virtuous support is half the holy life
A non-virtuous spiritual friend, a non-virtuous companion, a non-virtuous support, however, is not
The Bhagavān replied
Ānanda, do not say that a virtuous spiritual friend, a virtuous companion, a virtuous support is half the holy life, but that a non-virtuous spiritual friend, a non-virtuous companion, a non-virtuous support is not
Why
Ānanda, the point is tha
a virtuous spiritual friend
a virtuous companion
a virtuous support is the whole, the unadulterated, the complete, the pure, the totally purified holy life, bu
a non-virtuous spiritual friend
a non-virtuous companion
a non-virtuous support is not
Ānanda, it is because, by relying on me as their spiritual friend
sentient beings subject to birth will be completely released from being subject to birth, an
sentient beings subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, and agitation will be completely released from being subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, and agitation
Therefore, Ānanda, you should understand this in the following way alone
Ānanda, you should train thinking in this way
When the Bhagavān had spoken these words
the bhikṣus rejoiced an
highly praised what the Blessed One had taught
This completes The Noble Sūtra on Reliance upon a Virtuous Spiritual Friend

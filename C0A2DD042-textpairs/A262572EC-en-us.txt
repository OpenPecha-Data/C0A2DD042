The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Questions of the Kiṃnara King Drum
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was residing on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of sixty-two thousand monks, and with seventy-two thousand bodhisattva great beings who had gathered from the worlds of the ten directions. All of them had developed the higher perceptions
They had attained recollection, unobstructed eloquence, and absorption. They were perfectly mindful, intelligent, realized, devoted, humble, and modest. Their motivation was firm and indivisible like vajra
They perfectly applied themselves to all the qualities of buddhahood, and they had developed the most noble motivation
Without ever themselves forsaking the mind set on awakening, they caused others to adopt that same attitude
They were generous, self-controlled, restrained, gentle, and patient. Everything that was pleasant they would give away, and knew how to dedicate these acts
Their bodies, speech, and minds were adorned with the ornament of discipline. They had an impartial attitude toward all beings and they had donned the powerful armors of patience and gentleness
They had exercised diligence for countless billions of eons, and they reveled in the wisdom of the concentrations, liberations, absorptions, attainments, and higher knowledges
They were experts in the wisdom and insight of unobstructed eloquence with respect to the distinctions of all words. Their minds were unshakeable like Mount Sumeru. Like earth, water, fire, wind, and mountains they were free of attachment and anger
They were abiding in great love and their splendor was unobstructed. They were abiding in great compassion and always diligent in caring for all beings. They were abiding in great joy and were delighted by the joy of Dharma. They were abiding in great equanimity and had reached nondual cognition
They had completely transcended the eight worldly concerns—gain, loss, fame, disgrace, praise, blame, pleasure, and suffering
They had utterly defeated all the multitudes of wicked opponents and conquered the hostile forces of Māra and the afflictions
Their presence was as rare as the sight of the uḍumbara flower and, without being asked, they acted as virtuous friends for all sentient beings, always accompanying them until nirvāṇa
They uttered the great lion’s roar, resounding with the profound Dharma of the Buddha as well as with fearlessness
They were marked by the seal of the thus-gone ones. They taught clearly without any disturbance and their actions accorded with their words
They were diligent in the Dharma-way of suchness, and their light eclipsed the light of the sun and the moon

Their minds were focused on keeping the lineage of the Three Jewels unbroken. They were skilled in traveling to an infinity of buddha realms
They had the intelligence that is grounded in the discernment of all distinctions. To see and hear them was so beneficial that it was overwhelming
They constantly exerted themselves to bring sentient beings to maturity and they had reached the highest level of mastering insight and methods
They taught the Dharma to all sentient beings in the appropriate manner, knowing those who were of the highest faculties and those who were not
They were skilled in observing the conduct of all sentient beings and they were naturally skilled in the pursuits and imputations of all beings
Due to their great fearlessness, they were dauntless, and they were utterly at peace from old age, sickness, death, and the afflictions
They had created roots of virtue in relation to a boundless number of billions of buddhas
They had gathered the accumulation of merit that completes the excellent major and minor marks, and they had also gathered the accumulation of wisdom
They were inclined toward all the qualities of emptiness, the absence of marks, and the absence of wishes. They were free from aspiration. They were confident in the insight that all beings and phenomena are like illusions, mirages, dreams, reflections of the moon in water, optical illusions, echoes, and space
They were experts in the wisdom that teaches in the words of all languages, and they had achieved the four correct knowledges related to phenomena, meaning, language, and eloquence
They had actualized the power of supramundane insight, obtained the ten powers that possess great might, and developed the perceptions of the physical eye, the divine eye, the insight eye, the Dharma eye, and the buddha eye
They were experts in the wisdom that engages in all the ways of gathering the accumulations related to the branches of the path
They knew the procedures for developing the understanding of the bodhisattvas’ scriptural collection. They turned the irreversible Dharma wheel
They had reached the absorption of the seal of characteristics . They were experts in the wisdom related to the absorption of the vajra circle . They had manifested the absorption that controls all phenomena 
They held the torch of the supreme Dharma Jewel. They perceived the mindstreams of all beings and were experts in seeing their thoughts
They were attending to all beings through the activity of awakened wisdom and they were adorned with all the precious qualities replete with the most supreme of all aspects
Even if their praises were proclaimed for all the eons, this task would never come to an end
Among the seventy-two thousand bodhisattvas were the bodhisattva great beings Priyaṃkara, Source of Joy, Ratnapāṇi, Ratnakusuma, Ratnaketu, Priyadarśana, Delightful to Behold, Ruciramati, Pleasing and Delightful, Dharaṇī­dhara, Avalokiteśvara, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Great Glory, Mārajit, Mandārava­gandha, Vāyu, Joy of Truth, View of Equality, Meruśikhara­dhara, Merukūṭa, Meruvara, Jālinīprabha, Jayamati, Soothing Birth, Jagatīṃdhara, Worshiped by the King of Gods, Uttaramati, Asaṅgacitta, Dawn Intellect, Protector of Men, Boundless Precious Treasure, Prabhāketu, Prabhāśrī, Pradīparāja, Bodhimati, Adorned with Light, Manifold Flowers, Devarāja, Divine Perception, Subāhu, Sucintitacintin, Feet Consecrated with Wheels, Trampling with Unmoving Feet, Trampling with Vajra Feet, Subjugating the Three Worlds under One’s Feet, Joyful Eloquence, Swift Eloquence, Anācchedya­pratibhāna, Blessed Eloquence, Gentle Sounds, Provider of All Beings’ Satisfaction, Brahmaghoṣa, Bhadrapāla, Ratnākara , Susārthavāha, Naradatta, Varuṇa, Maitreya, Mañjughoṣa, and Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta
Also present were Śakra, Brahmā, and the protectors of the world, as well as gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans. They had all come from all parts of this great trichiliocosm and gathered in the assembly to behold the Blessed One, pay homage to him, revere him, and listen to the Dharma
At that time, the bodhisattva great being Divyamauli was part of that retinue. When he saw that great assembly of bodhisattvas, he stood up
draped his shawl over one shoulder
prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and knelt on his right knee
Bowing down with his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One, he uttered these verses of praise
“You have transcended the world and serve as a lamp for its inhabitants
Wise One, you accomplish the benefit of the world
You have reached illumination, and you eliminate the stains of afflictions; Illuminator of the world, I pay homage to you
“You delight in generosity, you possess the ten supreme powers, You are gentle and restrained, and you have reached the culmination of discipline
Blessed One, you are worshiped by gods, humans, and nāgas, And you have perfected discipline; I pay homage to you

“King of the worthy ones, you have cleared away the dust of the afflictions, And you abide by right livelihood, spiritual observances, and discipline
Foremost among gods, you are free from stains And defeat hostile forces; I pay homage to you
“Blissful One, like a supreme jewel, you bring joy. You always reside in isolated places and enjoy solitude

“Powerful One, you are worshiped by gods and humans. Protector, you defeat Māra, the lord of the gods. You are revered by hosts of humans, gods, and nāgas. Sublime and foremost among humans, I pay homage to you

“You speak in pure and delightful tones And your voice is soft like the voice of Brahmā. Having perfected all the elements of speech, You convey the truth in a melodious way; I pay homage to you
“Wise One, you are expert in the entry to the liberations— The profound emptiness, the absence of marks, and the absence of wishes That are difficult to perceive and extremely hard to realize— And you are delighted by the path of liberation; I pay homage to you
“Blessed One, you are expert in causality. Forever free from the views of the two extremes, You only describe the ripened effects of actions, And you are liberated from the darkness of views; I pay homage to you
“You expound on phenomena that are always void— That do not come from or go anywhere— Phenomena that are free of ‘mine,’ like mirages and illusions. You who teach the way of the virtuous Dharma, I pay homage to you
“That which arises is unborn—it does not arise anywhere. It arises and disintegrates, without vanishing anywhere. The abiding mode of phenomena abides in the natural ground; I pay homage to the Victor who does not abide anywhere
“Your teachings always accord with the way things are, And you continuously dwell within suchness, without wavering
Your body, like Mount Sumeru, a victory banner, and a vajra, Is unshakeable like the Supreme Mountain; I pay homage to you
“Wise One, your body is disengaged, your mind impartial, And your infinite fame pervades the three worlds. Supreme being, moon of the world, please agree To answer questions posed to you!
After the bodhisattva great being Divyamauli had praised the Blessed One with these fitting verses of praise, he said
“Blessed One, should I be granted the opportunity, I would like to ask a few questions of the Blessed One, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha.
The Blessed One replied
“Noble son, ask whatever you wish of the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha
I will answer your questions and bring satisfaction to your mind.
The bodhisattva great being Divyamauli said, “Excellent!” and

When the Blessed One had explained this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments
this great trichiliocosm shook in six ways, a bright light pervaded the universe, an
billions of gods living in the sky started to sing divine songs
They caused a rain of divine mandārava flowers to fall and exclaimed, “Oh! The unsurpassed and perfect awakening of the blessed buddhas that has been described in this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments was achieved countless billions of eons ago by the Blessed One
Blessed One, those sentient beings who hear this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments, develop interest upon hearing it, and then retain it, carry it, read it, comprehend it, and teach it to others without parting from the mind of awakening will not be endowed with trifling roots of virtue
Just as the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha proclaimed the lion’s roar today, they will proclaim the lion’s roar within the worlds of gods, humans, and demigods
Blessed One, we are very fortunate to have heard this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments!
When the Blessed One had explained this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments
eighty-four thousand gods and humans gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and twelve thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
Then, the bodhisattva great being Divyamauli asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what are the qualities that will be possessed by the bodhisattvas who retain a sūtra like this one after the Thus-Gone One’s passing, and who teach it at length to others?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “the bodhisattvas who retain such a sūtra after the Thus-Gone One’s passing, and who teach it in a vast way to others, will possess eight qualities
What are those eight
 Their intent with respect to perfect awakening will be definitive—they will possess a perfect attitude
 They will be devoid of anger toward any being—they will cultivate the practice of great love
 They will abide by the activity of ripening beings—they will abide by great compassion
 They will wish for the Dharma and exert themselves in its pursuit.  They will be insatiable in their pursuit of learning and their level of erudition will become as vast as an ocean
 They will uphold the sacred Dharma even at the cost of their bodies and lives.  They will gather the accumulation of merit and their roots of virtue will be firm
 They will be blessed by the power of the buddhas such that they become perfected in their aspirations, and, within the entourage, they will know no fear and they will defeat all demons and opponents
Noble son, the bodhisattvas who uphold such a sūtra after the Thus-Gone One’s passing, and who fully teach it to others, will be endowed with those eight qualities.
Then, through the power of the Buddha, this great trichiliocosm shook in six ways
all the higher and lower regions, the black mountains, and all springs, lakes, ponds, and oceans disappeared, an
this entire earth became flat like the palm of the hand
Still, all the beings living in the water remained unharmed
Also, throughout this great trichiliocosm all the trees that had withered centuries before started to bloom and bear various fruits. These trees then bent in the direction of the Blessed One and paid homage to him
All of the other trees also started to bloom and bear various fruits, before bending in the direction of the Blessed One and paying homage to him
Bright, lovely, colorful, fragrant, and delightful lotuses the size of chariot wheels sprang up from the earth, an
a dazzling light illuminated this great trichiliocosm
Without anyone being seen or anything being played, divine music and singing were heard from the sky
Colorful divine flowers that emanated the most delicious fragrances, which had never been experienced before, now appeared on the majestic Himavat mountains as well as on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana, an
their sweet fragrances spread throughout this great trichiliocosm
A great rain of flowers then fell from the majestic Himavat mountains and from the majestic Mount Gandhamādana onto the retinue of the Blessed One, covering the earth up to their knees
Rains of various types of flowers fell from the blooming trees and the sounds of music and song resounded all around
A parasol made of all kinds of precious gems and measuring about a million leagues covered the sky
Pearl garlands and lattices formed by different types of small precious bells were hanging from that bejeweled parasol
The small bells rang out with the most delightful, enthralling, and enrapturing sounds that pervade this great trichiliocosm
At that moment, Venerable Śāriputra asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, whose coming is augured by these delightful and pleasurable signs that manifest on such a vast scale and adorn this great trichiliocosm so richly?
replied the Blessed One
“Śāriputra,” “these are the signs of the arrival of Druma, the king of the kiṃnaras. He is coming from Mount Gandhamādana with a retinue of many thousands of kiṃnaras, a retinue of many thousands of gandharvas, and a retinue of many thousands of gods.
As soon as the Blessed One had said those words, the kiṃnara king Druma arrived at the place where the Blessed One was residing. He was accompanied by eighty-four thousand musicians and singers and surrounded by a retinue of several hundred thousand. From the sky above a stream of flowers rained down
When he arrived, he prostrated with his retinue at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and sat in front of him
In the presence of the Blessed One and accompanied by the eighty-four thousand musicians, the kiṃnara king Druma then began to play his lute. Its body was made of beryl and it had trim and veneer made of gold from the Jambū River. It was adorned with gold, jewels, and many precious substances, and purified through the ripening of his previous actions
As soon as the kiṃnara king Druma started to play, the tunes of his lute resounded throughout this great trichiliocosm
The tunes from his lute outclassed all the divine music from the strings and songs of the gods of the desire realm, to the point that these could no longer be heard
Then, impelled by the tunes of that lute, the gods of the desire realm put down their divine instruments and came to the place where the Blessed One was residing
As soon as the kiṃnara king Druma started to play his lute, all the trees, and the majestic mountains Sumeru, Himavat, Gandhamādana, Mucilinda, and Mahāmucilinda, the black mountains, and all blades of grass, branches, medicinal plants, and forests of this great trichiliososm started to vibrate, shudder, and reel
wobble, rock, and sway
and quiver, tremble, and quake
Just as someone intoxicated by liquor staggers, reels, and wobbles, all those trees and mountains started to bend, bow, and twist
With the exception of the bodhisattvas who had reached the level of irreversibility, as soon as the kiṃnara king Druma started to play his beryl lute, all those who had gathered in the assembly surrounding the Blessed One—the dispassionate monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, and female lay practitioners, as well as the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, humans, nonhumans, worthy ones absorbed in the eight liberations, and the entire retinue—became overwhelmed upon hearing the tunes emitted by that lute
They stood up and started to shake, shiver, and tremble
they bent, bowed, and twisted
and they danced, swayed, and whirled
Even all the great hearers could not remain in their seats
They trembled, shook, acted wildly, and danced around like small children
The bodhisattva Divyamauli said to all those great hearers
“Venerable ones, great hearers, you are free from afflictions, you are absorbed in the eight liberations, and you have seen the four truths
Why can you no longer control your bodies? Venerable ones, you are dancing around like small children!
“Noble son,” replied the great hearers, “as the kiṃnara king Druma picked up his lute and started playing it, the music and songs made it impossible for us to remain in our seats; we began to shake, shiver, and tremble, an
we were unable to control our minds.
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the elder Mahākāśyapa
“Venerable Mahākāśyapa, you have reached old age and are frail, you are content and have few desires, you uphold the ascetic practices, and you are the focus of worship for the world with its gods, humans, and demigods
Why can you no longer control your body? You are an elder, but you dance around like a small child!
“Noble son,” said the elder Mahākāśyapa, “when a violent wind is blowing during a hurricane, all the plants, forests, and mountains become powerless and weak
they cannot remain in place and quiver, tremble, shake, and wobble against their will
Noble son, in the same way, upon hearing the tunes emitted by the lute of the kiṃnara king Druma, we became unable to control ourselves, just like great mountains shaken by a violent hurricane
Why is that so? Because such are the extraordinary qualities of the aspiration, merit, and wisdom of this sublime being
They outclass the merit, wisdom, and magnificence of the hearers.
The bodhisattva Divyamauli continued
“Venerable Mahākāśyapa, the tunes emitted by this lute are unable to affect and shake the splendor, the magnificence, and the power of the bodhisattvas who have reached the level of irreversibility. Therefore, Venerable Mahākāśyapa, why would one not give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Notice how the power and magnificence of those who possess limited wisdom is outclassed by the tunes of that lute, and how the power and magnificence of the followers of the Great Vehicle cannot be outclassed.
At that moment, when the kiṃnara king Druma played his lute, through the power of the Buddha and the blessings of his previous aspirations, these verses manifested from his lute and the other eighty-four thousand instruments
“All inferior, middling, and supreme phenomena Are the same—detached, peaceful, Empty, unchanging, and undisturbed; They are primordially pure, like the stainless sky
“All sentient beings of the present and the past Are the same—they are nonbeings
The words of beings expressed in language, too, Are just like Dharma words—they are nonexistent
“All the realms are the same—they are nonrealms Just like space, they manifest as sameness
They are beyond increase, inexhaustible, unborn, Empty, and immaculate like space
“All buddhas are the same—they are nonbuddhas
The realm of phenomena is definitely unadulterated
Discipline, insight, wisdom, and liberation are equal, And their single characteristic is sameness—the absence of characteristics
“All afflictions are nonafflictions—they are liberated
Ideas, thoughts, conceptuality, and discursiveness Move neither internally nor externally, An
notions are derived from the knot of mistaken perception
“The expression realm of phenomena is imputed conceptually, And that expression is beyond sameness and difference
Those who have realized the nature of name-and-form Always remain free of attachment when they act within the world
“The numerous Dharma teachings Taught by the countless blissful ones of the past Are primordially detached from exhaustion, dispersion, and disintegration
They do not go anywhere, or in any direction
“These phenomena originate from words, An
words are perishable—they have the property of coming to an end
Those who understand the exhaustible nature of words Do not generate concepts about any phenomena
“All mindstreams are the same—they are nonmindstreams, Since they are not attached to various natures
Since they know the endless phenomena of mind and mental states, The noble ones understand the sameness of phenomena
“Everything finite and infinite is interrupted and eliminated, An
beginning, end, and middle are the same
Their knowledge is of sameness since it is detached from the three times, And that knowledge is beyond limits
“Beings are constantly attached to name-and-form And tainted by the views of what is finite and infinite. Those who understand that they originate from causes and conditions Do not conceptualize them in terms of self and other
“That which arises from the self is always nonarisen, An
all phenomena are beyond emergence
Those who understand what arises and what is beyond arising Have reached acceptance and are in harmony with sameness
“All phenomena always have the nature of selflessness— They are empty like clouds, lightning, and space
Oneself and other beings are always intrinsically empty
This is the entrance into the seal of dhāraṇī
“The single characteristic of phenomena is to be devoid of characteristics
Those who teach infinite Dharma teachings After having realized the three gateways to liberation Do not conceptualize the Dharma in any way
“Inferior, middling, and supreme Dharma teachings Originate from words, Bu
they explain their meanings Without conceiving of any words
“They do not engage in a duality of meaning and words
The meaning of nonduality is always beyond words
Those who understand that this limit is void Will eliminate its very beginning
“Those who eliminate the very beginning Engage with conditioned things for the sake of beings
Understanding that the limit of reality is always limitless
Their love and compassion are immaculate
“Those whose love and compassion are immaculate Experience the sameness of suffering and happiness
Not excited, not puffed up, and steadfast, Those supreme beings understand the ultimate conduct
“This Dharma way is peaceful and detached
When it is explained, it generates joy, Ye
it is never increasing or decreasing
Its true reality is beyond self-grasping—it is peace
“The words here in the sky are beyond apprehension
No one speaks them but still they are heard
The one who speaks and the ones who are spoken to— What potent fictions they all are!
As these verses were manifested
their elucidations caused one hundred thousand bodhisattvas to reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
Then, the bodhisattva Divyamauli asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, where do these verses come from?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “Ask the kiṃnara king Druma. He will answer your question.
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then asked the kiṃnara king Druma
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, where did these manifested verses appear from?
The kiṃnara king Druma replied, “They come from where the words pronounced by all beings come from.
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, where do the words pronounced by all beings come from?
“Noble son, the words pronounced by all beings come from space.
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, is it not the case that the words pronounced by all beings come from within themselves?
“Noble son, what do you think? Do the words pronounced by all beings come from within their bodies, or do they come from their minds?
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, they come neither from their bodies nor from their minds
since their bodies are made of inanimate matter that cannot perform actions—like grass, clay, walls, trees, or optical illusions—and sinc
their minds are formless, indemonstrable, unimpeded, and imperceptible like illusions.
“Noble son, apart from their bodies and minds, where else could these words come from?
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, it is said that the words of beings come from mental engagement.
“If there were no space, where would sounds come from?
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, apart from space, where else could sounds come from?
“Noble son, you should understand through what we have said here that all sounds come from space
The essential nature of space is sound
it ceases as soon as it is perceived, an
once it ceases, it remains within the essential nature of space
It is therefore said that all phenomena are the same as space
Even though they are surely beyond perception and impossible to know, they are expressed through words and verbal expressions, and those expressions are designations
Those who understand verbal expressions in this way are not attached to anything
those who are not attached do not generate conceptual elaboration
those who do not generate conceptual elaboration do not transmigrate
those who do not circle around are unbreakable
those who are unbreakable do not take birth
those who are not born do not perish
those who do not perish are pure
those who are pure are immaculate
those who are immaculate are stainless
those who are stainless are clear
and clarity is the nature of the mind
The nature of the mind is penetration
penetration overcomes all marks
and those who overcome all marks are said to enter into faultlessness
The bodhisattvas who enter into faultlessness reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
They are therefore referred to as ‘bodhisattvas who have entered into faultlessness and reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
“Those who have reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena have reached acceptance with respect to everything, with respect to both emptiness and persons
Why is that so
Because emptiness is not different from persons
persons themselves are emptiness
They have reached acceptance with respect to both marks and the absence of marks
Why is that so
Because the essential nature of marks is the absence of marks
They have reached acceptance with respect to both wishes and the absence of wishes
Why is that so
Because the characteristic of the essential nature of wishes is the absence of wishes
They have reached acceptance with respect to beings’ inherent transcendence of suffering as well their process of death and rebirth
Why is that so
Because death and rebirth have the essential nature of being illusions
Noble son, the bodhisattvas who have reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena in this way are without cessation and are not in conflict with any phenomenon
Their acceptance with respect to the self encompasses all sentient beings, an
it also encompasses all phenomena, since it is beyond coming and going
They correctly know that all phenomena abide within the realm of phenomena and that the same goes for all beings
That attainment whereby nothing is attained is referred to in conventional terms as ‘gaining acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
This acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena cannot be expressed, described, or demonstrated
Why is that so
Because its meaning is inexpressible, beyond words, and indescribable. Noble son, this teaching in which the inexpressible meaning is nevertheless expressed demonstrates the greatness of the Thus-Gone One!
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the Blessed One
“Oh, Blessed One, the kiṃnara king Druma’s eloquence in teaching the acceptance of the profound Dharma is amazing! So is his level of experience and perception of this vast domain, and his profound acceptance while teaching the Dharma
Blessed One, in relation to how many thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas did the kiṃnara king Druma create roots of virtue to develop such eloquence?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “are you able to count all the stars present in as many universes as there are grains of sand in the Ganges
Similarly, all the perfect buddhas in relation to whom the kiṃnara king Druma created roots of virtue, and all the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas in whose presence he practiced pure conduct in his pursuit of unsurpassed and perfect awakening are uncountable
This is the reason why he has developed such eloquence.
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the kiṃnara king Druma
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, will you awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood due to the numerous roots of virtue you have accumulated in relation to all those many thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas?
“Noble son,” replied the kiṃnara king Druma, “when bodhisattvas are creating roots of virtue, there are twelve activities they never tire of
What are those twelve
They never tire of  worshiping and venerating the thus-gone ones,  listening to the Dharma,  upholding the sacred Dharma,  teaching the Dharma at length,  bringing sentient beings to maturity,  producing roots of virtue,  living in the wilderness,  mastering all the perfections,  purifying and ripening wisdom,  contemplating the Dharma and correctly putting it into practice,  pursuing the accumulations of merit and wisdom, and  accomplishing all the factors of awakening
Noble son, when bodhisattvas are creating roots of virtue, those are the twelve activities they never tire of
It is therefore said that bodhisattvas never grow tired of gathering the accumulation of virtue.
The kiṃnara king Druma then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, there is a bodhisattva absorption known as the source of wealth 
I have heard that if bodhisattvas rely on this absorption they will attain all extraordinary, precious qualities
Blessed One, so that those bodhisattvas may hear about that absorption and attain all those extraordinary, precious qualities, could the Thus-Gone One please explain to us this bodhisattva absorption of the source of wealth ?
replied the Blessed One
“Lord of the kiṃnaras,” “listen carefully and keep this in mind
I will explain to you the bodhisattva absorption of the source of wealth .
The kiṃnara king Druma agreed to this and listened as the Blessed One had directed. The Blessed One then said
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, bodhisattvas engage in eighty precious attitudes to avoid interrupting the continuity of the Buddha Jewel, to avoid interrupting the continuity of the Dharma Jewel, and to avoid interrupting the continuity of the Saṅgha Jewel
What are those eighty
They are  never forgetting the precious mind of omniscience,  never abandoning the precious attitude of good motivation

Those are the eighty precious qualities
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, engaging in those eighty attitudes, developing them, and persevering in them is known as the absorption of the source of wealth 
Those attitudes constitute the practice of that absorption
Once bodhisattvas achieve this absorption of the source of wealth , there is no mundane or supramundane wealth that they do not gain control over
Lord of the kiṃnaras, what is meant by mundane and supramundane wealth
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, mundane wealth refers to the greatness of gods and humans, such as that of Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, universal monarchs, merchants, householders, and brahmins and kṣatriyas that are like great sāl trees
Although the bodhisattvas achieve the greatness of gods and humans, they do not become excited or careless
Instead, they remain careful and so they accomplish the qualities that lead to awakening
This is what is meant by mundane wealth
“What is meant by supramundane wealth
It is the precious Dharma that transcends the world
What is the precious Dharma that transcends the world
It is the Dharma that liberates from the world
What is the Dharma that liberates from the world
It is the noble supramundane insight—the insight that liberates from the world
This precious insight subsumes all qualities that transcend the world; it is the most important among all supramundane qualities
For example, lord of the kiṃnaras, the most important body of water is the great ocean
the most important mountain is the majestic Mount Sumeru
the most important celestial body is the moon
the most important source of light is the sun
the most important wild animal is the lion
the most important person is the king
the most important god in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three is Śakra, an
the most important being within the Brahmā realms is the Great Brahmā
Similarly, lord of the kiṃnaras, the most important of all supramundane qualities is insight, and it is therefore referred to as the king of all qualities
“Insight is the path that frees from non-Buddhist views and thus leads to happy states of existence
It is the lamp that clears away the darkness of afflictions, [the hero that brings victory in battle, the doctor that dispenses medicine, the teacher that imparts the knowledge of all sciences, the arrow that pierces all phenomena, the sword that severs all afflictions, and the plough that cuts through the thicket of the afflictions.

Since it is sameness, it is beyond contradiction
Since it pacifies conflict, it is beyond dispute
Since it is beyond arising, it is beyond cessation
Since it is the ultimate understanding of the true meaning, it is undisturbed
Since it employs mindfulness, it remembers
It sees the sameness of the true relinquishments
It gives rise to the bases of miraculous display
It guards the strengths
Due to its powers, it cannot be suppressed
It contemplates the branches of awakening
It shows the path
It brings the peace of tranquility
It knows special insight
It illumines because it is free from obscuration
With the light of Dharma it dispels darkness
Since it is free from stains, it is immaculate
Since it is free from disrespect, it is devoid of arrogance
Since it transcends the path of fear, it produces knowledge
Since it transcends inside and outside, it is devoid of object
Since it is devoid of the formulation of views, it is liberating emptiness
Since it pacifies conceptuality, it is characterized by the absence of marks
Since it transcends the three realms, it has the characteristic of the absence of wishes
Since it is devoid of characteristics, it is the single characteristic
Since it is unequaled, it has the characteristic of space
Since it is beyond the work of Māra, it has conquered the movement of thoughts and conceptuality
It is nonconceptual generosity, nonabiding discipline, nondwelling patience, diligence beyond acceptance and rejection, concentration free from imputation, and the gateway to the imperceptible
It is directed toward everything
It is skillful
It is fully committed to the selflessness of all beings
It accumulates roots of virtue
It is beyond deeds and free from activity
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, this is the precious insight
This is the precious insight achieved by the bodhisattvas who have reached the absorption of the source of wealth 
When this insight is achieved, all wealth is subsumed within it
For example, lord of the kiṃnaras, the great ocean is the gateway for all rivers an
it contains and gathers all jewels; it is the source of all of them
Similarly, lord of the kiṃnaras, the bodhisattvas who attain this absorption of the source of wealth become the gateways for all wealth
they contain the entire Dharma Jewel and subsume all other wealth
The Three Jewels—the Buddha Jewel, the Dharma Jewel, and the Saṅgha Jewel—originate from that absorption of the source of wealth 
It is therefore said that the absorption of the source of wealth contains all wealth.
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, has the kiṃnara king Druma achieved this absorption of the source of jewels ?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “you should ask the kiṃnara king Druma and he will tell you.
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then asked the kiṃnara king Druma
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, have you achieved this absorption of the source of jewels ?
“Noble son, this absorption does not concern something that can be attained or apprehended. It cannot be attained by anyone
This absorption cannot be categorized as form, feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness
This absorption does not have a physical form
This absorption cannot be apprehended by the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, or the mind
It does not have the characteristics of arising, [ceasing, and enduring.
It does not have the characteristics of [arising, ]ceasing, and [enduring.
It does not have the characteristics of [arising, ceasing, and ]enduring
It does not have the characteristic of being interrupted
It does not have a singular characteristic or several characteristics
It is not characterized or noncharacterized, but neither is it beyond characteristics
It is inexpressible
This absorption cannot be understood, realized, or comprehended
Why is that so
Because, if this absorption was understood, realized, or comprehended, it would become a basis of investigation and it would not be an absorption
“Noble son, absorption refers to the sameness of all phenomena
The sameness of all phenomena is the same with respect to myself and all beings
Therefore, noble son, this absorption and all beings are the same
Why is that so
Because all sentient beings are empty, an
this absorption has the characteristic of emptiness
all sentient beings are without marks, an
this absorption has the characteristic of the absence of marks
all sentient beings are without wishes, an
this absorption has the characteristic of the absence of wishes
all sentient beings are disengaged, an
this absorption has the characteristic of disengagement
all sentient beings are selfless, an
this absorption has the characteristic of selflessness
It cannot be reached through body, speech, or mind
It is taught in the well-spoken Dharma-Vinaya that those who seek to reach, connect, and unite with the Dharma are proud.
At that moment, the bodhisattva Divyamauli exclaimed
“Blessed One, the careful conduct of the kiṃnara king Druma and his eloquence concerning the Dharma are amazing!
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “this way of displaying all activities while not being tainted by any of them is the level of bodhisattvas who are adept in skill and insight
Noble son, through the tunes of his lute, and through the songs, instruments, and drums, the kiṃnara king Druma has ripened seventy million kiṃnaras toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, along with three hundred million gandharvas and four hundred million mahoragas
He has also ripened eighty-four thousand beings from his own retinue toward awakening
Whenever bodhisattvas who possess such wisdom of insight and skill have a following of some magnitude, countless beings are ripened
Noble son, a fire cannot blaze without kindling
Likewise, when bodhisattva great beings remain in solitude, the ripening of beings cannot blaze
Noble son, a fire blazes when it is fueled by substances to burn
Likewise, when bodhisattva great beings reside among ordinary beings, the ripening of those beings will blaze
Noble son, through this analogy, you should understand that bodhisattvas ripen countless beings in proportion to the magnitude of the territory and the following they command.
When the Blessed One had said those words, the bodhisattva Divyamauli asked him
“Blessed One, how does the kiṃnara king Druma ripen beings through the tunes of those lutes, songs, instruments, and drums?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “when the kiṃnara king Druma plays his lute, accompanied by music and song, to the kiṃnaras, gandharvas, mahoragas, and those who are inspired by the sound of music, those kiṃnaras, gandharvas, and mahoragas become delighted and thrilled
As they become delighted, inspired, and thrilled, the sounds coming from the lute, the instruments, and the songs ring out with the words ‘Buddha,’ ‘Dharma,’ and ‘Saṅgha.

“Noble son, these sounds of the Dharma and these names of absorptions manifest in that way from the sounds of the lute, and those instruments and songs, which ripen those beings
Noble son, such are the amazing and marvelous qualities that bodhisattva great beings possess.
When the Blessed One had proclaimed the praises of the kiṃnara king Druma’s qualities
through the power of the Buddha divine mandārava flowers materialized in the hands of the entire assembly
who then tossed them toward the kiṃnara king Druma
Then, in accordance with the blessings, the kiṃnara king Druma caught the flowers in his right hand and tossed them toward the Blessed One without letting a single one of them fall to the ground
As soon as he threw those flowers, through the power of the Buddha a parasol made of precious flowers covered this entire chiliocosm
Billions of pearl garlands hung from it, an
myriads of light rays radiated from each pearl in those pearl garlands
Various lovely, colorful, fragrant, and delightful lotuses appeared on the tip of every light ray, an
on top of each of those lotuses thus-gone ones displaying the same physical form as the Blessed One Śākyamuni appeared, sitting cross-legged
All those blessed buddhas gave their approval to the kiṃnara king Druma
They said, “Sublime being, you have ripened many beings
Although you are free from all domains, you manifest in all of them to ripen sentient beings
Although you are free from saṃsāra, you intentionally display rebirth within existence
Although you have reached faultless nirvāṇa, you partake in the three realms. Such bodhisattva activities are excellent, excellent!
The kiṃnara king Druma then formed the resolve
“I will manifest other bejeweled parasols to cover the heads of all those thus-gone ones!
At that moment, the kiṃnara king Druma entered the absorption called the array of bejeweled parasols 
As soon as he had entered this absorption, bejeweled parasols manifested right above the head of each thus-gone one
Bejeweled parasols also appeared in the right hands of each member of the assembly, an
they used them to shelter those blessed buddhas
The kiṃnara king Druma then thought
“I will invite the Blessed One, the thus-gone one, the Buddha Śākyamuni, with his saṅgha of hearers and his saṅgha of bodhisattvas, for a meal
I will supplicate the Blessed One and his retinue to come to my land at the majestic Mount Gandhamādana
to enjoy my abode an
benefit countless gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
They will enthusiastically venerate and serve the Blessed One, an
they will thereby gain long-term benefit, welfare, success, happiness, and bodhisattva accomplishment.
The kiṃnara king Druma prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, joined the palms of his hands, and said
“Blessed One, out of love for me and in order to increase the roots of virtue of countless beings, I supplicate the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha to agree to remain for seven days in my abode on the slope of Mount Gandhamādana with his saṅgha of bodhisattvas and his saṅgha of hearers
Blessed One, we would be delighted to venerate and serve the Thus-Gone One and his retinue!
Out of love for the kiṃnara king Druma, the Blessed One agreed to remain for seven days on the slope of Mount Gandhamādana with his assemblies of bodhisattvas and hearers
When the kiṃnara king Druma saw that the Blessed One had accepted his request
he became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated
With joy and happiness filling his mind, he and his subjects and servants prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, and circumambulated him three times
They worshiped the Blessed One with musical melodies and then left the assembly, departing for the majestic Mount Gandhamādana
Then, as an act of worship for the Blessed One, the kiṃnara king Druma decorated his home with all sorts of ornaments
He adorned the five hundred leagues of his vast courtyard with blue beryl stones and with lotuses made of gold from the Jambū River, and he beautified it with a variety of other precious substances
In that courtyard, he arranged on foundations made of precious substances many hundreds of thousands of seats on which a hundred thousand divine fabrics were spread
He also prepared a lion throne for the Blessed One, which was twelve leagues high. It was adorned with all types of precious substances and was surrounded by jeweled stands that supported parasols, banners, and flags. It was perfumed with the finest incense, covered by a canopy, decorated with many silken streamers, and strewn with divine flowers
In the four directions around this lion throne, he emanated four groups of splendid precious trees
He then assembled all his subjects and uttered these verses
“Just like an uḍumbara flower, It is extremely rare for a Buddha to appear. That foremost of humans has now come; Worship the Protector with reverence
“Give up pride, haughtiness, dishonesty, Envy, stinginess, deceit, And all forms of agitation, And worship the Teacher with reverence
“Gather all the extraordinary flowers You can find in this divine land Of Gandhamādana And offer them to the supreme among humans
“To worship the supreme being, Perfume Gandhamādana With extraordinary, sweet-smelling fragrances, And with yellow sandalwood
“Kiṃnaras, worship the foremost of humans With delight and faith, Always playing and dancing, And offering many delightful melodies of song and music
“Carry a lot of magnificent divine parasols, flags, Banners, Dharma robes, and canopies To welcome the Thus-Gone One— Peerless and so difficult to behold
“By worshiping the Buddha, you will be reborn Into the happy states of existence, As Śakra, the protectors of the world, Brahmā, the lord Īśvara, Or great rulers of gods and humans
“By worshiping the foremost of humans you will be blessed With good looks and complexion, and with fame and praise; You will enjoy retinues, material possessions, ruling power, And you will speak with pleasant and persuasive words
“Those who wish to experience here The conditioned pleasures of gods and humans, And those who wish to be filled with happiness Should worship this protector of the world
“Those who wish for the awakening of the solitary buddhas And the hearers, or for the sacred and supreme vehicle, And those who wish to defeat the hordes of Māra Should worship this supreme being!
After the kiṃnara king Druma had instructed all his servants and subjects in that way
they gathered flowers, fragrant substances, garlands, and ointments, and prepared delicious food
Then, they gathered on the southern slope of the majestic Mount Gandhamādana and started playing music and singing songs
In poetry accompanied by singing and the playing of lutes, they invoked the Blessed One with these melodious verses
“Benefactor, provider of happiness and joy, Blessed One— With a smiling face immaculate like the moon, Supreme being, sublime practitioner worshiped by gods and humans— Blissful One, it is time for you to arrive here
“Possessor of the might of the ten powers, conqueror of all hostile armies, Vanquisher of hosts of enemies, benefactor of beings, Undisturbed and unsullied, you have abandoned all stains and harshness; Benefactor, it is time for you to arrive here
“You observe the ascetic practices, purify stains, and eliminate all doubts, An
you are mindful, intelligent, generous, resolute, realized, and wise
King of beings, you are forever beyond existence and have abandoned existence, Ye
you benefit others, please them, and have a joyful mind
“You outshine the beautiful light of the sun, the moon, jewels, and lightning, As well as the light emitted by Śakra, Brahmā, and all the gods of the three realms
Sage, your splendorous and bright light benefits others, And so, Victorious One, you are radiant with your brilliant light.
“With your divine voice, nāga voice, and kiṃnara songs, You pacify the blazing afflictions again and again
Your Brahmā voice—supreme and deep— Pacifies all afflictions by extinguishing their fire
“Even doctors who roam throughout the ten directions Could not pacify the afflictions wherever they occur
Yet when you, unsurpassed king of doctors, proclaim your words, All afflictions are pacified and all forms of happiness are granted
“Your light is extraordinary, your power is supreme and peerless, Your faultless and undeluded speech tames all enemies, You clear away the darkness of our blurred vision and cause it to become spotless
Benefactor free from enemies, it is time for you to arrive here
“Your generosity, composure, and excellent conduct are unequaled
Your practice of discipline is unshakeable—you delight in discipline and austerities
Your mind has embraced patience, composure, and virtue, An
your cheerful words eliminate the joy of your enemies; we supplicate you to arrive
“You enjoy the powers, strengths, and path, and revel in concentrations and higher perceptions
Your mind is firmly established in mindfulness, wisdom, realization, and resolution
Your mind is delighted and you shine with the brightest light
You who possess such excellent qualities; it is time for you to arrive
“You have mastered love, compassion, joy, and equanimity, Overcome the darkness of faults, and eliminated all latent tendencies
You are trained in the path of purity and you dwell on the path of the victorious ones
Blissful One who brings joy, it is time for you to arrive!
When the Blessed One heard the kiṃnara king Druma’s verses announcing that it was mealtime, he said to his saṅgha of monks
“Monks, the kiṃnara king Druma has requested us to come. So, take your alms bowls and your Dharma robes, and appoint a caretaker to stay in the temple for seven days.
At this moment, the bodhisattva Divyamauli formed the resolve
“I will emanate a mansion in which the Blessed One and his assemblies of bodhisattvas and hearers can reside
I can then lift up this storied mansion, which contains bejeweled lion thrones, with my right hand and carry it through the sky to the majestic Mount Gandhamādana!
In that instant, the bodhisattva Divyamauli entered into a state of absorption
As soon as he had entered this absorption, a beautiful and magnificent storied mansion appeared in front of the Blessed One. It measured ten leagues, and it was square, built with four pillars, perfectly proportioned, and symmetrical
Inside the mansion, seats made of majestic lotus flowers were arranged
The mansion also had a lion throne for the Blessed One, made of precious lotuses and the height of seven men
When the bodhisattva Divyamauli had manifested this storied mansion and the lion throne
he said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, out of love for me, please take your place in this storied mansion with these bodhisattvas and great hearers, and sit on this lion throne that I have manifested
Blessed One, I will then take this storied mansion in my right hand and transport it to the majestic Mount Gandhamādana.
Out of love for the bodhisattva Divyamauli, the Blessed One entered the storied mansion with those bodhisattvas and great hearers, and they all sat on the thrones that had been arranged for them
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then placed the storied mansion in the palm of his right hand and carried it through the sky by means of his miraculous powers 
When the gods of the desire realm and the gods of the form realm saw the miraculous display of the bodhisattva Divyamauli
they became pleased, cheerful, thrilled, and elated
Once joy and happiness had filled their minds
as an act of worship for the Blessed One and the bodhisattva great being Divyamauli, they carried flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, and ointments, played instruments and drums, and venerated the Blessed One, who resided in the storied mansion as it traversed the sky
When they arrived at the majestic Mount Gandhamādana
the kiṃnara king Druma saw the Blessed One residing in the storied mansion as it approached in the sky
Surrounded by eighty-four thousand kiṃnaras and gandharvas
he came to welcome the Blessed One carrying flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, and ointments, playing instruments and drums, and singing songs
Then, with his subjects and retinues, the kiṃnara king Druma prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and offered him the flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, and ointments they were carrying, while playing instruments and drums and singing songs
Knowing that the time had come, the Blessed One then proceeded, together with the bodhisattvas, the great hearers, Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, and the other gods, to the courtyard that had been arranged by the kiṃnara king Druma
where he sat on the lion throne that had been prepared for him
All the groups of bodhisattvas and hearers also sat down on their respective seats
The kiṃnara king Druma said to Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, the gods of the desire realm, and the gods of the form realm
“My friends, please join the Thus-Gone One for the midday meal
All of you, come here!
Then, the kiṃnara king Druma and his queens, children, subjects, retinues, and servants personally offered a rich feast of the most delicious and flavorful foods and beverages to the Blessed One, his saṅgha of bodhisattvas, his saṅgha of monks, and the rest of the assembly
they fed them to their full satisfaction
After they were satiated, the Blessed One put his alms bowl aside and washed his hands
When they saw this, the king, the subjects, and the servants all sat down in front of the Blessed One to listen to the Dharma, each on their respective seats
The Blessed One then gave a Dharma discourse to the kiṃnara king Druma and the whole assembly
It captivated, [inspired, and delighted ]them
It [captivated, ]inspired, [and delighted ]them
It [captivated, inspired, and ]delighted them
This is the Dharma discourse that he gave

 They intentionally manifest as thieves to ripen hundreds of beings who have engaged in various types of evil activities and who have been incarcerated in the royal prisons; when they are identified as rogues, they enter a prison where, through their miraculous powers , they wash and anoint the bodies of the prisoners, dress them in fine clothes, and offer them food and beverages until they are fully satiated; then they release them from their tight shackles and teach them the Dharma in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening
 To ripen beings who are led to the place of their execution at the king’s command, and who are tormented by suffering and the fear of dying, bodhisattva great beings miraculously emanate manifestations that free such condemned prisoners who are being led to their execution from their shackles; they then teach the Dharma to those beings who have been relieved from fear and whose lives have just been saved, in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening
 Bodhisattva great beings skillfully remain wherever beings are involved in quarrels, disputes, fights, and conflicts about possessions, wealth, fields, household materials, male servants, female servants, workers, or soldiers; through their miraculous powers they settle the conflicts by giving away their possessions, wealth, and precious materials and, once the different parties have been thus reconciled, they cause them to embrace unsurpassed and perfect awakening
 Even though the major and minor parts of bodhisattvas’ bodies are fully functional, they skillfully manifest with impaired abilities, in order to ripen sentient beings
 Even though the bodhisattvas’ conduct is perfect, they manifest all kinds of disturbed forms of conduct to ripen sentient beings
 Bodhisattvas adept in skillful means manifest themselves as non-Buddhists, and to attract non-Buddhists in faraway lands, who live in demonic domains under the influence of demons, to the teachings of the Buddha, they proclaim the praises of the Three Jewels in front of them
 To skillfully ripen others, bodhisattvas give up the concentrations, liberations, absorptions, and attainments, and intentionally take rebirth within the desire realm; they describe the suffering of birth to those who wish for nirvāṇa, and they teach about nirvāṇa to cause those who have attained disengagement to cultivate the highest path
 Bodhisattvas skillfully display the bodies of buddhas to those who aspire to reach nirvāṇa but who have not yet entered the faultless state
 To cause beings who have faith in the Buddha and whose minds are settled to embrace the mind set on awakening, they teach them how to attain understanding of this conditioning factor
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that bodhisattva great beings are skilled in means through those thirty-two features.
When the Blessed One had taught this section on the purity of engaging in the perfections and skill in means
the retinue of the kiṃnara king Druma and ninety-eight thousand beings including gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Among the retinue of the Blessed One, eighteen thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
The kiṃnara king Druma reached the absorption called the lamp of insight
With this Dharma discourse, the Blessed One had pleased, captivated, and inspired the kiṃnara king Druma
Through this instruction, the king became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated
With joy and happiness filling his mind
he clothed the Blessed One in a priceless piece of seamless fabric
He also clad each member of the saṅgha of bodhisattvas and each member of the saṅgha of hearers with cloths of inestimable value, an
offered all his dwelling places for the enjoyment of the Blessed One
Then, eight thousand sons of the kiṃnara king Druma offered shade to the Blessed One with an array of precious lotuses and eight thousand precious parasols
In that very moment, through the power of the Buddha, all those parasols merged to form a single precious parasol in the sky, about a thousand leagues above the courtyard, right over the Blessed One’s head
When the eight thousand sons of the kiṃnara king Druma saw this great miraculous display manifested by the Blessed One, they became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated
With joy and happiness filling their minds
they gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening with determination and supplicated the Blessed One
“Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, Worthy One, Perfect Buddha, please tell us about the qualities that mature into awakening so that, upon hearing about them, we may accomplish the factors of awakening!
Aware of the good motivation of the sons of the kiṃnara king Druma, the Blessed One rose up to a height of seven palm trees and remained seated cross-legged in the air
His body shone with light, illuminating this entire great trichiliocosm with a bright light
All the various musical instruments of the kiṃnaras, the gandharvas, the mahoragas, and the gods of the desire realm then started to resound with the most delightful music, without anyone playing them
The sound of music also rang out from all the fragrant, flowering, and blooming trees growing on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana
Next, myriads of light rays shone from all the pores of the Blessed One’s skin, an
lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels manifested on the tip of each light ray
At the heart of each lotus flower bodhisattvas appeared, displaying pure bodies adorned with the thirty-two marks of great beings
Then, through the power of the Buddha, all the musical instruments resounded with questions in the form of verses
each of which was clearly answered by the bodhisattvas, who replied in chorus, also in verse

When they heard those verses, the sons of the kiṃnara king attained acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
Then, having attained that acceptance
they covered the Blessed One in their respective garments and ornaments and said
“Blessed One, why has the Buddha manifested to us in the form of those verses we just heard
Blessed One, the music and song gave voice to these questions that expressed doubt and, as the bodhisattva manifestations answered each of them, they dispelled all the doubts of the assembly, causing a boundless illumination of the Dharma to arise in us. This is amazing
Blessed One, what has caused these tunes to be emanated from those instruments
And whose blessings produced the answers of those bodhisattva manifestations?
replied the Blessed One
“Good people,” “you should regard all of these as the blessings of the Buddha
Good people, if the sound of the Dharma can emanate even from the sky through the blessings of the Thus-Gone One, why would the sound of the Dharma not be emanated from instruments
Good people, in this way the blessings of the Thus-Gone One are inconceivable.
The sons of the kiṃnara king then exclaimed
“Blessed One, may all sentient beings receive the inconceivable blessings of the Buddha!
Then, eighty-four thousand kiṃnarī queens of the kiṃnara king Druma came to the place where the Blessed One was residing, carrying with them necklaces made of multicolored pearls
When they arrived, they prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and adorned him with the pearl necklaces they were carrying
As soon as they had made their offerings, those necklaces transformed, through the power of the Buddha, into eighty-four thousand pavilions made of pearl, in the sky above the Blessed One’s head
All the mansions were square, supported by four pillars, well proportioned, and symmetrical
Inside those pavilions, thrones studded with jewels set on bases made of precious substances appeared, and many layers of divine fabrics were spread upon them
Thus-gone ones adorned with the thirty-two major marks of great beings sat upon these thrones

The eighty-four thousand queens of the kiṃnara king Druma then prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, who saw their good motivation and smiled
In accord with the nature of the blessed buddhas, when the Blessed One smiled, light rays radiated from his mouth in various colors—blue, yellow, red, white, violet, crystalline, and silver—an
spread throughout an infinite number of universes
rising up to the abodes of Brahmā and eclipsing the light of the sun and the moon
The light rays then came back toward the Blessed One and circumambulated him three times, before vanishing into the top of his head
At that moment, venerable Ānanda stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and bowed down respectfully and reverentially with his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One
With these verses, he then asked the Blessed One about the meaning of his smile
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you whose face is stainless like the moon
I ask you who radiates pure majesty
I ask you who has the color of gold
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who has a sublime physical appearance
I ask you who benefits beings
I ask you who is worshiped by gods and men
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who is delighted by generosity and control
I ask you who has pure discipline
I ask you who possesses the power of patience and confers this power upon others
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who possesses the power and strength of diligence
I ask you who is delighted by concentration and higher perception
I ask you whose insight is equal to space
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who always has a loving heart
I ask you who is always compassionate
I ask you who is delighted by joy and equanimity
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who brings an end to the three realms
I ask you who possesses the three spotless eyes
I ask you who teaches the ambrosia of the Dharma
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who eradicates demonic influences
I ask you who subdues the evil hordes
I ask you who sees the sacred truth
“Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you who possesses the ten sacred powers
I ask you who eliminates all doubts
I ask you who is adorned with a thousand qualities.
After venerable Ānanda had uttered those verses, the Blessed One asked him
“Ānanda, did you see how the queens of the kiṃnara king Druma have generated roots of merit in relation to me
Did you see how they sincerely gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and how they prostrated to my feet in order to leave behind their female bodies and acquire male bodies?
“Yes, Blessed One, I saw this.
“Ānanda, by sincerely creating those roots of virtue, these eighty-four thousand kiṃnara queens will, after they die, leave their female bodies behind, acquire male bodies, and be reborn with the general fortune of the gods of the Heaven of Joy
Once they are born there, they will, together with the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, propagate the perfect awakening of the blessed buddhas
When Maitreya achieves the awakening of a thus-gone one, they will serve him and propagate his sacred Dharma
Then, one after the other, they will serve all the thus-gone ones of this excellent eon and propagate and uphold their sacred Dharma
They will gradually perfect all the factors of awakening that are to be accomplished
Then, when the kiṃnara king Druma awakens to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, they will be reborn in his buddha realm, an
he will prophesy their unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
Then, the kiṃnara king Druma said
“Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, you have performed the deeds of a buddha for us
You have closed all the paths leading to the lower realms and cleared all the paths leading to the happy destinies
You have placed us on the path to awakening
You have revealed to us the treasure of the Dharma
You have established us at the level of wisdom
You have caused all our roots of virtue to blaze forth
You have taught us the different aspects of the perfections
You have taught us skillful means
You have granted us the opportunity to embrace the mind set on awakening
You have generated joy in us by proclaiming the Dharma
You have encouraged us to develop joy, faith, and delight
You have inspired us to rejoice in the acceptance of the profound Dharma
You have established us on the level of irreversibility
We will always remember the kindness of the Blessed One; we will never forget it! Blessed One, even with our own flesh and blood, let alone anything else, we would never be able to repay the the Thus-Gone One’s kindness.
At that moment, some bodhisattvas present in the assembly wondered
“How long will it take the kiṃnara king Druma to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood
What will his name be
How large will his saṅgha of bodhisattvas be
What will his wealth and possessions be like
What will his array of beings and the array of qualities of his buddha realm be like?
Knowing the thoughts of those bodhisattvas, the Blessed One smiled and many hundreds of thousands of multicolored light rays radiated from his mouth
illuminating as many buddha realms in each of the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Ganges
Those light rays allayed all the suffering of all the beings in the lower realms and inspired the world with its gods, humans, and demigods
The light rays then came back toward to the Blessed One and circumambulated him a thousand times, before vanishing into the top of his head
When he saw that smile of the Blessed One, which he had never seen before, venerable Ānanda stood up, joined his palms together, and prostrated to the Blessed One’s feet
He circumambulated him three times and knelt on his right knee in front of him
Then, bowing down with his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One, he uttered these verses
“The radiance of the Blissful One’s smile, which we have witnessed today, Has spread throughout countless millions of vast buddha realms in the ten directions, As numerous as the countless grains of sand in the Ganges; I have never seen such a smile before
“The radiance of the Lord of Humans Has eclipsed the brilliance of Brahmā, the protectors of the world, Gems, fire, the sun, and the moon
Please explain to us the reason behind this smile
“Great hero, for whom did you emit this light That pacifies the three lower realms and perfects the branches of awakening
Dharma Lord, please eliminate our doubts
Please remove all our uncertainty
“As the entire assembly joyfully reflects on this, For whom did you smile today?
After he had offered those verses of praise to the Blessed One, venerable Ānanda circumambulated him and sat down at his seat
The Blessed One surveyed the ten directions with his elephant’s gaze and then said to venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, did you see the manner, the greatness, and the way in which the kiṃnara king Druma worshiped the Thus-Gone One?
“Yes, Blessed One, I saw it
Blissful One, I saw it.
“Ānanda, the kiṃnara king Druma will awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood after sixty-eight billion eons
during the eon called Ratnākara, in the universe called Candravimalā. He will appear in the world as the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha called Guṇarāja­prabhāsa. He will be learned and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who guides beings, an unsurpassed being, a teacher of gods and humans, and a blessed buddha
Ānanda, that universe called Candravimalā will be smooth like the palm of the hand and made of white beryl. It will shine like the moon and be stainless, immaculate, and devoid of any discoloration
This thus-gone one’s saṅgha of bodhisattvas will be immeasurable, an
all those bodhisattva great beings will without exception have reached the state of irreversibility and the inconceivable level of liberation
Those bodhisattvas will enjoy floating mansions in the sky, an
while residing there they will be able to see the image of the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One Guṇarāja­prabhāsa reflected in the ground made of white beryl
As soon as they see his image, they will remember that all phenomena are similar to reflections, an
whenever doubts about the Dharma arise in their minds, they will pose questions to that reflection of the Thus-Gone One
Their questions will then be answered by that thus-gone one, thus satisfying their minds
Upon hearing the Dharma, those bodhisattvas will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
Ānanda, in that universe there will be no villages, cities, towns, provinces, countries, or royal palaces
all beings will live in such mansions in the sky
In that buddha realm, even the word woman will not be heard
all beings will be born miraculously from the hearts of lotus flowers
Even the word food will not be heard
everyone will feed on the joys derived from concentration and the Dharma
Everyone will be firmly established within the Great Vehicle and nowhere else
No one will adhere to wrong discipline, wrong views, wrong behavior, or wrong livelihood
Everyone will be determined and strive for buddha qualities
In that buddha realm there will be no demons or gods of the demonic class, and there will be no non-Buddhist proponents such as carakas and parivrājakas, no one who clings to conceptual views, and no opposing factions
All beings will be marked by the seal of emptiness—the profound domain
In that universe, with the exception of their mere names and titles, there will be no difference between gods and humans
everyone will share the same experience
“Ānanda, the Blessed One, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha Guṇarāja­prabhāsa will remain for ten intermediate eons, to bring benefit and happiness to many gods and humans
When the Blessed one, the Thus-Gone One Guṇarāja­prabhāsa eventually decides to pass into nirvāṇa, he will prophesy, ‘After me, the bodhisattva great being Uttaptavīrya will awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood
He will be a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha called Mahāvyūha. He will be learned and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who guides beings, an unsurpassed being, a teacher of gods and humans, and a blessed buddha.’ After making this prophecy about the bodhisattva Uttaptavīrya he will then pass into nirvāṇa
Ānanda, during these intermediate eons, beings will never be separated from the Buddha Jewel, the Dharma Jewel, and the Saṅgha Jewel
this intermediate eon will therefore be called Ratnasaṃpad.
When the kiṃnara king Druma heard the prophecy of the Blessed One, he became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated
With joy and happiness filling his mind
through the force of this bodhisattva’s joy and delight, he rose up into the air to a height of seven palm trees
Then, in order to increase the faith of the entire retinue and to generate roots of virtue, he uttered these verses through the power of the Buddha and his own insightful eloquence
“All phenomena are void and stainless— They have the essential nature of space. Those who understand this sacred key point Will become the foremost children of the Sage
“Just like dreams, all phenomena are completely beyond perception— They are nonexistent, beyond apprehension, unreal, and empty. Those who know that all phenomena are like dreams Will not experience weariness in relation to conditioned things
“The appearances of magically created Horses, elephants, chariots, soldiers, and mounts Are ultimately devoid of substance. In the same way, the aggregates are insubstantial, like illusions
“The Victor has said that forms have the nature of foam, Feelings are similar to water bubbles, Perceptions are like mirages, An
formations are hollow, like plantain trees
“Likewise, he has said that the mental consciousness of the three realms Is unreal, like a magical illusion
Those who know that forms are intrinsically empty Will never experience weariness in relation to conditioned things
“Those who know that the four elements are similar to the realm of phenomena, That the sense sources are like empty cities, And that phenomena are unreal and empty Are in possession of the Dharma treasure of the victorious ones
“Those who, in order to completely tame themselves, Engage in generosity, self-control, discipline, and pure training, Those who always cultivate infinite patience with a noble attitude And pursue emptiness with flawless diligence, “Those who constantly remain in the state of concentration And develop insight free from attachment Without generating concepts— They will gain mastery over the perfections
“Impartial love based on selflessness, Superior space-like compassion, And joy and equanimity derived from peace: That is the path of purity—it is always peaceful
“The Guide has taught the extraordinary four means of attracting disciples In order to gain students
Those who are free from grasping and conceptualization Will perfect those means of attraction
“Sentient beings are devoid of self, sentient being, Life principle, individuality, and person, An
the six senses are empty and completely pacified; Those who understand this are bodhisattvas
“Sentient beings and bodhisattvas are nonexistent
Sentient beings who understand that there is no self, And who are free from thinking, duality, attachment, And concepts, are glorious bodhisattvas
“Like illusions, phenomena lack substance— They do not come from or go anywhere
The victorious ones see the mode of the realm of phenomena— They are buddhas who are identical to suchness
“Although phenomena are neither existent nor nonexistent, They arise based on causes. Thus, they are like lightning that vanishes in the sky as soon as it appears; One should understand that the thicket of the mind is also like that
“The formless mind moves among conditioned things Just as wind circulates through space without being caught on anything
Those who understand the pure nature of the mind Will not develop formless afflictions
“The body is made of inanimate matter and has no master, Like walls, grass, leaves, stones, or wood. Those who understand its nature in this way Will not dwell on the qualities of the body
“Like the wind, words can never be apprehended. Sounds are void, Like echoes resounding in mountains or caves; Those who understand this will not be attached to any sounds
“I remain here in the sky without falling
It is not possible to fall out of space
Those who meditate on the space-like nature of phenomena Realize that beings share the same mode in being nonexistent
“Even though burned for many hundreds of eons, Space could never be consumed by fire
Those who understand that all phenomena are like space Will travel to hundreds of buddha realms during eons of fire
“Those who know the space-like characteristic Of all mountains, such as Mount Sumeru, the surrounding mountains, And all the mountainous regions, Will miraculously travel to millions of buddha realms
“The heroes who comprehend that the four elements — Earth, water, fire, and wind— Are just like open space Will travel through the sky to countless millions of realms
“Even if one tried to describe their full scope for a hundred eons, Using all the words and languages found in the three realms— Anything fine, crude, and in-between— It would not appear as the nature of what has been before; it is beyond movement
“Although being self-arisen is not the supreme mark
It is distinguished in its nature by being a mental phenomenon
Because thoughts and the mind are the same in being void, And because all victors are equal in qualities, they are the same
“The illustrious ones who understand the sameness of awakening After having practiced bodhisattva conduct in their past lives And gathered hundreds of thousands of virtues Will receive a prophecy
“All phenomena are pristine in their own domain
Being infinite, they are the same as the domain of the victors
Beings with excellent qualities who understand this sameness Will receive a prophecy
“Although I am beyond form, feeling, perception, Formation, and consciousness
I received a prophecy because I understand awakening
I did not receive it because of my aggregates and elements
“Acceptance is primordially peaceful— It is not momentary and finite
The Victor predicted that those who attain the peerless acceptance of the unborn Will become rulers of men
“The nature of all phenomena and the self are the same
The self is selfless and intrinsically empty
Emptiness has the essential nature of space, And awakening always has the nature of space
“Since it is yet to be exhausted, exhaustion cannot be known
Since the inexhaustible is exhausted, it will not be exhausted
Through the gateway of exhaustion, all phenomena are unborn
Thus the Buddha predicted those endowed with acceptance.
“Being signless, there is no foundation for foundational engagements
Ultimately, what is unconditioned is free from time
It is uncreated, impervious to activity, and nonarisen
The Victor prophesies in such a way
“If I thought, ‘I will be prophesied,
I would connect with the Dharma path in an uneven manner
Not connecting with the Dharma by means of thinking and min
Is the exalted way of connecting with the Dharma—the way of sameness and equality
“You are all sitting on the ground, Whil
I remain here in the middle of the sky
Understand that the earth and the sky are the same, Give up attachment to the three realms, and develop wisdom!
After he had uttered those verses, the kiṃnara king Druma descended from the sky, joined his palms together, prostrated to the Blessed One, and said
“Blessed One, the Buddha has appeared for my sake
Why did he do so
Because I have never engaged in bodhisattva conduct meaninglessly in the past, an
since I have not broken faith with my previous roots of merit, the Blessed One has prophesied my unsurpassed and perfect awakening to fulfill all my aspirations.
At that moment, some bodhisattvas present in the assembly wondered, “Under which thus-gone one, worthy one, perfect buddha did the kiṃnara king Druma first give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening?
Knowing the thought that had arisen in the minds of those bodhisattvas, the bodhisattva Divyamauli asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what is the name of the thus-gone one under whom the kiṃnara king Druma first gave rise to the mind set on awakening?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “In the past, countless eons ago, so long ago that the amount of time cannot be measured or conceived, during the eon called Viprasanna, a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha appeared in the world, in the universe called Śubhā. He was learned and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who guides beings, an unsurpassed being, a teacher of gods and humans, and a blessed buddha known as Ratnaskandha
Noble son, at that time, the saṅgha of bodhisattvas of the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha Ratnaskandha counted six hundred million members
They were all diligent, they had all reached acceptance, all of them had attained irreversible progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, an
their lifespan stretched over six hundred million years
That universe, Śubhā, was made of beryl and adorned with all possible types of ornaments. Just as in the divine abode of the Heaven of Joy, that realm had all the most sublime features, and all houses, possessions, pleasures, food, and beverages manifested just by thinking of them
In that buddha realm, everyone without exception was settled within the Great Vehicle and nowhere else
“Noble son, at that time, a universal monarch called Nimiṃdhara, who ruled over the four continents and was endowed with the seven precious attributes, appeared in the world
He had forty thousand queens, and [one thousand sons that were all brave, courageous, and possessed the most handsome physiques and the power to overcome their opponents.
He had [forty thousand queens, and ]one thousand sons that were all brave, courageous, and possessed the most handsome physiques and the power to overcome their opponents
Noble son, the king Nimiṃdhara worshiped the Thus-Gone One Ratnaskandha in a boundless manner, revering him and his six hundred million bodhisattvas for ten million years with offerings of beautiful Dharma robes, food, bedding, medicine, provisions, and every other type of pleasing article
Supported by those roots of virtue
he gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening together with his forty thousand women, one thousand sons, and eighty-four thousand other beings
Then, they venerated the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One Ratnaskandha, for ten million years
Later on, when his eldest son named Vratapariśuddha was enthroned, he relinquished his kingdom, shaved his head and cut his beard, put on the saffron-colored Dharma robes, and with trust went forth from the household into homelessness under that blessed one’s teaching
Then, as each prince following in the line of succession became enthroned, the elder sons followed the example of their father and went forth, one after the other
Noble son, such was the length of the Thus-Gone One’s lifespan
After all those princes had gone forth under that thus-gone one
they enthroned the youngest son named Karuṇāmati to govern the kingdom leniently in accordance with the Dharma, without using any weapons
Noble son, in that way, the king Nimiṃdhara and his sons went forth under the teachings of that blessed one and
during the beginning, the middle, and the end of their lives, they always upheld the sacred Dharma of the Thus-Gone One Ratnaskandha
“Noble son, at that time, the kiṃnara king Druma was born as the king Nimiṃdhara—that universal monarch ruling over the four continents. Noble son, do not be skeptical, do not have any hesitation or doubts about that fact, thinking that this was someone else
All those princes are now practicing bodhisattva conduct in the ten directions
Noble son, the kiṃnara king Druma thus gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening under the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One Ratnaskandha
From the moment he gave rise to the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening up until today, he has met buddhas, listened to the Dharma, and revered the Saṅgha without interruption
For this reason, since he has swiftly and genuinely accomplished the accumulations for perfect awakening, I have prophesied today that, in the future, he will become the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha called Guṇarāja­prabhāsa.
At that moment, the bodhisattva great being Divyamauli exclaimed
“Blessed One, you possess the unimpeded wisdom of the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas. Although those roots of virtue were formed a long time ago, you perceive this through your unobscured wisdom. This is amazing!
replied the Blessed One
“Thus it is, noble son,
“as you have said
the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha possesses unimpeded wisdom vision
Why is that so
Because, noble son, the Thus-Gone One clearly knows the exhaustion, cessation, separation, and transformation of the past mindstreams of all beings; he knows from which causes their mindstreams emerged and the absence of causes through which they became exhausted, as well as all their virtuous, nonvirtuous, specified, and unspecified mental states with all their features, foundations, and circumstances
The Thus-Gone One clearly knows the present mindstreams of all beings and all the virtuous, nonvirtuous, specified, and unspecified mental states that arise in them; he knows the sequence of all those mental states with all their features, foundations, and circumstances
The Thus-Gone One clearly knows the future mindstreams of all sentient beings and all the virtuous, nonvirtuous, specified, and unspecified mental states that will arise in them; he knows the sequence of all those mental states with all their features, foundations, and circumstances
Noble son, this is how the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha possesses unimpeded wisdom vision.
When this teaching on the unimpeded wisdom of the Thus-Gone One was expounded, three hundred thousand beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening
Then, after the kiṃnara king Druma had revered the Blessed One and his saṅghas of bodhisattvas and hearers for seven days by offering them all types of pleasing articles
he offered his own home and courtyard to the Blessed One for his use and said
“Blessed One, please always come and stay in this place out of love for me
By doing so, you will assist and bring happiness to many beings, you will show your love for the world, you will benefit a huge number of beings, and you will bring benefit and happiness to the kiṃnaras, the gandharvas, and the mahoragas.
Then, the son of the kiṃnara king Druma called Vimalanetra offered a net of precious gems to the Blessed One and made this request
“Blessed One, although we, the kiṃnaras, are on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening, we remain strongly attached to our music and the tunes of our instruments, as well as to song and dance, an
we carelessly enjoy and frolic with flowers, perfumes, incense, ointments, and powders. Blessed One, please grant us the instruction on the gateway of the seal of the precious Dharma, so that we may develop carefulness and accomplish the factors of awakening!
The Blessed One replied to the kiṃnara prince Vimalanetra
“Good man, I will bless you so that, from now on, sixty-four factors that will ripen you for awakening will manifest from the tunes of your instruments and your songs
What are those sixty-four
They are  the sound of impermanence,  the sound of suffering,  the sound of selflessness,  the sound of peace,  the sound of the absence of formation,  the sound of detachment,  the sound of the absence of arising,  the sound of insubstantiality,  the sound of the absence of origination,  the sound of the absence of abiding,  the sound of reality,  the sound of the limit of reality,  the sound of the realm of phenomena,  the sound of the absence of a sentient being,  the sound of the absence of a life principle,  the sound of the absence of a person,  the sound of generosity,  the sound of discipline,  the sound of patience,  the sound of diligence,  the sound of concentration,  the sound of insight,  the sound of love,  the sound of compassion,  the sound of joy,  the sound of equanimity,  the sound of the absence of coming,  the sound of the absence of going,  the sound of the absence of movement,  the sound of groundlessness,  the sound of baselessness,  the sound of emptiness,  the sound of the absence of marks,  the sound of the absence of wishes,  the sound of the freedom from desire,  the sound of the absence of manifestation,  the sound of reliance,  the sound of nonreliance,  the sound of the Buddha,  the sound of the Dharma,  the sound of the Saṅgha,  the sound of boundless awakening,  the sound of the applications of mindfulness,  the sound of the true relinquishments,  the sound of the bases of miraculous display,  the sound of the strengths,  the sound of the powers,  the sound of the branches of awakening,  the sound of the path,  the sound of tranquility,  the sound of special insight,  the sound of methods,  the sound of the means to attract disciples,  the sound of the maturation of beings,  the sound of the subjugation of Māra,  the sound of the embrace of the sacred Dharma,  the sound of all phenomena being like illusions, dreams, reflections, reflections of the moon in water, and echoes,  the sound of the unadulterated realm of phenomena,  the sound of not being weary with saṃsāra,  the sound of manifestation,  the sound of the accumulation of all roots of virtue,  the sound of foam, water bubbles, mirages, plantain trees, illusion, and insubstantiality,  the sound of actions that accord with one’s words, and  the sound of accomplishing the Dharma
Good man, those are the sounds that will manifest from the instruments and songs through the power of the Buddha, causing you to carefully accomplish the factors of awakening.
Amazed, the entire retinue prostrated to the Blessed One and exclaimed
“Blessed One, the way the blessed buddhas grant their blessings toward awakening, the way they teach the Dharma, and the way the Thus-Gone One looks after the bodhisattvas is amazing!
replied the Blessed One
“Very well said, my friends,
“the Thus-Gone One looks after the bodhisattvas
Why is that so
Because, by looking after the bodhisattvas, he looks after all beings
Friends, when the Thus-Gone One looks after the bodhisattvas, that accomplishes the benefit of all beings
It is for the sake of all beings that bodhisattvas put on the great armor with which they can lead a countless and limitless number of beings away from cyclic existence to the transcendence of suffering
Friends, in this manner you should understand that, whether I am still alive or have passed beyond suffering, those who look after the bodhisattvas are looking after all beings
Friends, those who serve the bodhisattvas by offering them Dharma robes, alms, bedding, medicine, and provisions serve all beings
Friends, those who provide pleasing articles to the bodhisattvas provide pleasing articles to all beings
Why is that
Friends, it is because even the mere breathing of bodhisattvas is done out of great compassion for all beings. They look after all beings for the sake of their benefit and happiness.
At that moment, the gods of the desire realm, the gods of the form realm, the gods of the pure realms, the nāgas, the yakṣas, the gandharvas, the kiṃnaras, the mahoragas, and the entire retinue rejoiced at the Blessed One’s well-spoken words, an
they showered him with many kinds of multicolored divine flowers
The kiṃnara king Druma then thought
“It would be improper for me to let the Blessed One and the bodhisattvas travel from my abode to Vulture Peak Mountain through their own miraculous powers . As an act of worship to the Thus-Gone One, I shall therefore manifest a chariot in which the Blessed One, his saṅgha of bodhisattvas, and his saṅgha of hearers can sit, an
I shall then personally pull the chariot with my retinue
This is how I will worship the Thus-Gone One!
The kiṃnara king Druma then mentally emanated a divine chariot made of the seven precious substances. It was five leagues high and five leagues wide, surrounded by a railing made of precious gems, and adorned with different kinds of trees. It was decorated on top with a web of gems and a lattice made of stringed jewels
Within the chariot, he emanated a majestic and beautiful lion throne as high as seven men on which many hundreds of thousands of layers of fine fabrics were spread
He also emanated seats for all the bodhisattvas and for the entire saṅgha of hearers
Above the chariot, he also emanated appropriate seats for those who had heard the Dharma from the Blessed One and followed him as servants—Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, the gods of the desire realm, the gods of the form realm, and the gods of the pure realms
After he had manifested that chariot, the kiṃnara king Druma then joined his palms together, prostrated to the Blessed One, and requested
“Blessed One, out of love for me, please sit in this chariot, with your entire retinue, on these seats I have arranged for you!
The Blessed One took his seat on the lion throne, an
the saṅgha of bodhisattvas, the saṅgha of monks, and the entire retinue also sat down on their respective seats
Then, through his miraculous powers , the kiṃnara king Druma placed the chariot in his right hand and raised it into the air at an elevation of seven palm trees
All the eighty-four thousand kiṃnarīs, the eight thousand sons, the hundred thousand kiṃnaras, gandharvas, and mahoragas, and the kiṃnara king Druma himself took bejewelled ropes, attached them to the chariot, and pulled it through the sky
As the Blessed One sat in the chariot traveling through the sky, the eighty-four thousand kiṃnarīs worshiped him while playing music and singing songs
Coming before him, they offered these verses of praise
“We, the eighty-four thousand kiṃnarīs With sublime physiques, Offer praises to the Great Guide By playing our instruments for him
“With the merit of the supreme marks you are splendorous
With your supreme physical form, whoever sees you is filled with joy, And you always abide by the qualities of the truth; Great ocean of qualities, we prostrate to you
“Peerless among the victors of the past, We have never seen anyone like you anywhere
Your body, steadfast and unwavering like Mount Sumeru, Blazes with splendor
“Guide, through your miraculous powers, You move through space unobstructedly
Like the sky, you are immaculate and stainless
Blessed One, dispeller of afflictions, we prostrate to you
“The light shining through the circle of hair between your eyebrows Eclipses the light emitted by the lord of the gods, the lord of the demigods, The rākṣasas, Śakra, Brahmā, the gods of the pure realms, The sun, the moon, and the stars
“You are a source of insight and you have an ocean of insight
You are an expert in the thoughts of all beings, An
you are worshiped by everyone within the three worlds
You who are renowned in the world, we prostrate at your feet
“You have ended the harm of the four Māras, You have cultivated and analyzed the four truths, And through your four magical powers you know no fear
You walk with the gait of a buddha—that beautiful gait. “Even after a hundred eons, you never become weary, And your mind always remains calm and composed
Although you satisfy beings through your excellent words, You do not fixate on words and language
“Your speech, pleasant and delightful, Resonates without obstruction in hundreds of universes, An
those who hear your voice Are filled with happiness
“Charioteer of beings, with a mere hair pore of your body, You could absorb the waters of all the oceans of this trichiliocosm, And ye
it would not harm the material beings there at all 
Your magical powers are completely faultless
“Even when you travel to many millions of universes While holding Mount Sumeru and all the mountains of this trichiliocosm In the palm of your hand
Your physical power remains undiminished
“For countless hundreds of eons, You have trained in disciplined conduct, austerities, The qualities of discipline, generosity, self-control, Restraint, patience, diligence, concentration, and insight
“You have served many millions of buddhas And upheld the Dharma they taught
You are endowed with great compassion And never tire of benefiting beings
“You never become weary when others do not honor you, And you never feel flattered when you are honored
Like the earth, you are even and unshakable
Like a lotus, you remain untainted by worldly concerns
“You know that empty phenomena are without marks, And that they have the same characteristics As reflections of the moon in water, illusions, Water bubbles, dreams, lightning, and mirages
“Persons are essentially selfless
They are primordially empty, unmoving, and unchanging, Immaculate and stainless like the sky
They are like things that disappear when they are used up. “Actions and deeds originate from causes and conditions; They appear, but disappear later on; Since you have completely purified this mode of being, You are known as the Perfect Buddha
“Great leader, those who see and hear you Are free from the fear of the lower realms And become destined for the higher realms
Such are the gains of those beings
“Sublime being, we worship you, And while doing so, We also give rise to the mind set on awakening
May all beings become like you, sublime being
“The limits of space could be measured
The water of the oceans could be emptied, An
the sun and the moon could fall to the ground, Bu
your awakened qualities will never be exhausted!
The golden-colored body of the Blessed One, as he traveled through the sky sitting in the chariot, shone with light that spread throughout this great trichiliocosm. The light also illuminated the city of Rājagṛha and Vulture Peak Mountain
In this way the Blessed One reached the city of Rājagṛha and Vulture Peak Mountain
Inspired by that light, King Ajātaśatru and his ministers, princes, merchants, townsmen, and householders, as well as the monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners, hastily came out of the great city of Rājagṛha to welcome the Blessed One in the afternoon, carrying with them flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, ointments, parasols, banners, and flags
When they arrived at Vulture Peak Mountain to meet the Blessed One
the tunes from the eighty-four thousand instruments played by Druma’s queens as they guided the chariot resounded over the entire mountain
In this way the kiṃnara king Druma with his armies and retinues miraculously transported the Blessed One through the sky and arrived at Vulture Peak Mountain
Once arrived, the Blessed One descended from the chariot and sat on the seat that had been arranged for him in his place
The bodhisattvas, the hearers, and the entirety of the retinues also descended from the chariot and prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One
After receiving his consent, they circumambulated the Blessed One and sat on their respective seats
The gods of the desire realm, the gods of the form realm, and the gods of the pure realms also descended from the chariot, prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, and sat on one side
Then, King Ajātaśatru and his ministers, princes, merchants, householders, and townsmen, as well as the monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners, offered the Blessed One the flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, ointments, powders, Dharma robes, parasols, banners, and flags they were carrying, prostrated at his feet, an
asked him, “Blessed One, are you not tired? Are you well?” They then sat to one side
The bodhisattva Divyamauli then asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what will the kiṃnara king Druma and his subjects achieve through the roots of virtue created by pulling the chariot, where the Blessed One and his retinues were sitting, through the sky?
The Blessed One replied
“Through these roots of virtue, the kiṃnara king Druma, his queens, his sons, and his servants will give rise to the mind set on awakening and, until they reach the seat of awakening, they will develop the higher perceptions, and these will never diminish
They will continuously travel from one buddha realm to the next, behold buddhas, listen to their Dharma, and revere the Saṅgha
During all their lifetimes, they will recollect their former lives, receive prophecies, exert themselves in upholding the sacred Dharma, and enthusiastically ripen beings.
King Ajātaśatru then said to the kiṃnara king Druma
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, the Blessed One has described your qualities. You are very fortunate! I would like to obtain a portion of your roots of virtue myself!
replied the kiṃnara king Druma
“Your Majesty,” “I offer the entirety of these roots of virtue to you and all beings
Why
Because, Your Majesty, there are no roots of virtue of bodhisattvas that are not shared with all beings
Your Majesty, there are no miserly bodhisattvas
they do not develop miserliness with respect to any of their roots of virtue
Even though they give away all their roots of virtue to all beings, they do not experience any anguish or any regret while doing so
Your Majesty, the roots of virtue that the bodhisattvas dedicate to omniscience will sustain all beings
Why
Because, Your Majesty, the awakening of the bodhisattvas will support, reach, and accompany all beings
Your Majesty, this is the reason you have met those two virtuous friends—the Blessed One and Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta
You have heard the sacred Dharma from them, an
it has cleared away the darkness of your unknowing and the great cataracts of ignorance from which boundless regrets arose
You have thus achieved the great light of Dharma that illuminates the Dharma, through which you have now reached freedom from obscuration and abide in that. You are therefore also very fortunate
Thus, Your Majesty, bodhisattva great beings should, devotedly and by all means, become vessels for the Dharma so that they never forget even a single Dharma word or letter after hearing them—so that they never squander them, but uphold them and guard them.
Then, the bodhisattva Divyamauli asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, how do bodhisattvas become vessels for the Dharma?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble son,” “if bodhisattva great beings possess thirty-two qualities, they will be vessels for the Dharma
What are those thirty-two
Noble son, they are  the blessings of the buddhas—the vessel of the bodhisattvas,  resolve—the vessel of pure motivation,  application—the vessel for propagating the path of awakening,  pure motivation—the vessel of extraordinary roots of virtue
 recollection—the vessel of erudition,  intelligence—the vessel for entering the path,  understanding—the vessel for understanding the meaning
 generosity—the vessel of great wealth,  discipline—the vessel for fulfilling one’s wishes,  patience—the vessel for attaining the thirty-two marks of a great being,  diligence—the vessel for achieving all the qualities of a buddha,  concentration—the vessel of a capable mind,  insight—the vessel for completely transcending all doubts
 love—the vessel of an unbiased attitude toward all beings,  compassion—the vessel for protecting all poor and destitute beings,  joy—the vessel of joy in the Dharma,  equanimity—the vessel for abandoning attachment and aversion
 virtuous friends—the vessel for leading one to uphold all roots of virtue,  tirelessly pursuing learning—the vessel of the perfection of insight
 going forth—the vessel of independence,  remaining in the wilderness—the vessel for having few desires and possessions,  enjoying solitude—the vessel of concentration and higher perception,  the means of attracting disciples—the vessel for ripening beings
 upholding the sacred Dharma—the vessel of the light of the Dharma,  retention—the vessel for remembering everything one hears,  eloquence—the vessel for eliminating the doubts of all beings,  recollecting the Buddha—the vessel for beholding buddhas
 recollecting the Dharma—the vessel of the perfection of insight,  the absence of anger—the vessel for guarding one’s roots of virtue
 trusting in emptiness—the vessel for abandoning all views,  dependent origination—the vessel for abandoning all extreme views
 attaining acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena—the vessel of undisturbed and continuous teaching, an
 the level of irreversibility—the vessel of the ten powers, the fearlessnesses, and the unique buddha qualities
Noble son, you should know that if bodhisattva great beings possess those thirty-two qualities they will be proper vessels for the Dharma.
When the Blessed One had expounded this teaching, ten thousand beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening and said, “Blessed One, may all beings become proper vessels for the Dharma, an
may we also become such proper Dharma vessels as described by the Blessed One!
The Blessed One then said to the kiṃnara king Druma
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, your retinue might start to become weary, so you should go back to your abode.
The kiṃnara king Druma replied
“Blessed One, someone who becomes weary cannot be called a bodhisattva
Blessed One, bodhisattvas should withstand weariness
Blessed One, how are bodhisattvas to be known as wearying
How are they to be known as unwearying?
replied the Blessed One
“Lord of the kiṃnaras,” “if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes, they are to be known as wearying
What are those four
They are  being scared when hearing that the realm of beings is infinite,  being scared when hearing about limitless saṃsāra,  being scared when hearing about the immeasurable wisdom of the buddhas, and  being scared when hearing that the excellent major and minor marks are achieved through boundless merit
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that, if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes, they are to be known as wearying
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
What are those four
They are  not being scared when hearing the words, ‘I will cause the infinite realm of beings to pass beyond suffering,’  not being scared when hearing the words, ‘I will embrace limitless saṃsāra to accomplish roots of virtue,’  not being scared when hearing the words, ‘I will perfect immeasurable omniscient wisdom,’ and  not being scared when hearing the words, ‘I will achieve the excellent major and minor marks that are attained by accumulating boundless merit.
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
“Furthermore, lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as wearying
What are those four
They are  occasionally wishing for the vehicle of the hearers,  occasionally wishing for the vehicle of the solitary buddhas,  forsaking the Dharma and not upholding it when it is about to disappear, and  not causing others to embrace perfect awakening
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as wearying
“Furthermore, lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
What are those four
They are  never forsaking the mind set on awakening even if it puts them in grave danger,  never wishing for the level of the hearers and the solitary buddhas,  guarding the sacred Dharma even at the cost of their lives, and  willingly traveling a thousand leagues to cause others to embrace awakening
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
“Furthermore, lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as wearying
What are those four
They are  being unhappy when meeting beggars,  putting all their efforts into collecting alms,  not putting effort into the pursuit of erudition, and  not teaching the Dharma to others as they have heard it
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as wearying
“Furthermore, lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
What are those four
They are  perceiving beggars as friends, smiling to them with a mind free from anger, and, without frowning, telling them, ‘Welcome, please come here,’  granting happiness to all beings without being attached to their personal happiness,  tirelessly pursuing erudition, and  teaching the Dharma that they have heard to others, fully and with a mind unconcerned with material things
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
“Furthermore, lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as wearying
What are those four
They are  not pursuing the path of the perfection of generosity,  not engaging in the means of attracting disciples,  not engendering diligence to ripen sentient beings, and  being satisfied with lesser qualities and not pursuing higher ones
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as wearying
“Furthermore, lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying
What are those four
They are  pursuing the path of the perfection of generosity as if their hair was on fire,  always exerting themselves in the means of attracting disciples,  engendering diligence to ripen sentient beings, and  perfecting all forms of virtue without being attached to them
Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should know that if bodhisattvas adopt those four attitudes they are to be known as unwearying.
After the Blessed One had answered the kiṃnara king Druma with this teaching on the fourfold attitudes, he asked King Ajātaśatru
“Your Majesty, did you hear this teaching of fourfold attitudes that cause the bodhisattvas to be known as wearying and unwearying?
“Yes, Blessed One, I heard it.
“Your Majesty, in that case you should practice bodhisattva conduct without becoming weary!
“Blessed One, what is the conduct of the bodhisattvas?
Then, in order to perfect the bodhisattva conduct of King Ajātaśatru, the Blessed One said to the kiṃnara king Druma
“Lord of the kiṃnaras, please explain your extraordinary skillful methods by which you ripen beings, in order to perfect the bodhisattva conduct of King Ajātaśatru!
At that moment, the kiṃnara king Druma picked up his lute in front of the Blessed One
As soon as he picked it up, through the power of the Buddha and the magnificence of his own roots of virtue, these verses on bodhisattva conduct manifested from his lute in a tune that resembled the lion’s yawn, or the sound of the wind as it stirs a group of sāl trees
“Those who engage in help and benefit, Those who earnestly apply themselves to listening to the Dharma, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without becoming weary
“Those who make others well and happy, Those who are unbiased toward all beings, And those who practice supreme awakening Do not practice a limited form of conduct

“Those who practice emptiness and disengagement, Those who practice the absence of marks and purity, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without wishful thinking
“Those who practice authenticity and suchness, Those who practice the purity of omniscience, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without attachment in all regards
“Those who practice trust and faith, Those who practice mindfulness and nondistraction, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without judgmental thoughts

“Those who practice the Dharma and what is suitable, Those who practice ripening all beings, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without interruption
“Those who practice proper deeds and qualities, Those who practice eliminating all views, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice free from all metaphysical views
“Those who practice purity and stainlessness, Those who practice to eliminate all afflictions, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without longing
“Those who practice happiness and liberation, Those who give supreme fearlessness to all beings, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without aspirations
“Those who practice like the sun and the moon, Those who remain unsullied like a lotus, And those who practice supreme awakening Are revered by the world with its gods
“Those who practice like Śakra and Brahmā, Those who perfect wholesome qualities, And those who practice supreme awakening Strike fear into Māra and his hordes
“Those who practice what is supreme and exalted, Those who eliminate the affliction of desire, And those who practice supreme awakening Practice without ignorance in all regards

eWhen those verses describing bodhisattva conduct manifested from the tunes of the lute
five thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
The retinue of King Ajātaśatru, the brahmins and householders from Rājagṛha, and eight thousand members of the retinues of the kiṃnaras, gandharvas, and mahoragas gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. They promised, “Blessed One, we will also train in bodhisattva conduct
We will accomplish it earnestly, an
we will encourage countless beings to adhere to this bodhisattva conduct!
After that, the Blessed One gave his approval for the kiṃnara king Druma to depart
Having received the Blessed One’s consent, the kiṃnara king Druma as well as his sons, troops, queens, subjects, and attendants prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulated him three times
While bidding him farewell, they played music, caused a rain of flowers to fall, and emitted webs of light
As the earth quaked in six different ways, they left the Blessed One and in that very instant arrived back home on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana
Śakra, lord of the gods, then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, the kiṃnara king Druma surpasses me in terms of his worship of the Thus-Gone One and the Dharma!
replied the Blessed One
“Kauśika,” “it is not only you that the kiṃnara king Druma surpasses
Kauśika, with the exception of bodhisattva great beings who have reached the bodhisattva levels, the kiṃnara king Druma surpasses Śakra, Brahmā, and the protectors of the world, as well as all the hearers and solitary buddhas of this great trichiliocosm
Why is that so
Because, Kauśika, as soon as bodhisattvas give rise to the mind set on awakening, they surpass all hearers and solitary buddhas, as well as Śakra, Brahmā, and all the protectors of the world
Kauśika, this being so, bodhisattvas cannot be surpassed by the world with its gods
Wishing to surpass the bodhisattvas is the same as wishing to surpass the thus-gone ones
Why is that
It is because the thus-gone ones originate from the bodhisattvas, an
the hearers and the solitary buddhas originate from the thus-gone ones.
When he heard this teaching, Śakra, lord of the gods, joined his palms together, shed tears, and exclaimed, “Alas
My wisdom is weaker than the dispassionate and unobstructed wisdom of the buddhas!
At that moment, the son of Śakra, lord of the gods, the god Kāśyapa, who was present in the assembly, said to his father
“Father, given that phenomena are completely isolated and do not have the characteristic of being involved in creation, those who do not give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and supreme awakening are not being compassionate toward all sentient beings
They do not attend to virtuous friends dedicated to the vast approach and they will feel regret in the future
Father, they are submerged in the faultless, their mental continuum is burned, and their seed is burned
They are not proper vessels for the Great Vehicle. What can be done?
When this teaching was given, one thousand gods among the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and supreme awakening
Then, the divine son Guardian of Light Rays said
“Blessed One, all the hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva acts and hardships that the Blessed One engaged in when he was practicing bodhisattva conduct in the past have become evident to me
Blessed One, please disclose a few details of how the Blessed One trained as a bodhisattva under the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha Dīpaṃkara and how he attained acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
Blessed One, after hearing about this acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena attained by the bodhisattva, I will accomplish it in the same way and thereby attain that quality!
replied the Blessed One
“Guardian of Light Rays,” “bodhisattvas who have not generated roots of virtue will not reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, bu
bodhisattvas who possess stable roots of virtue will reach this acceptance
Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
What are those four
They are  realizing the sameness of the buddhas,  realizing the sameness of the Dharma,  realizing the sameness of the Saṅgha, and  realizing the sameness of the buddha realms
Divine son, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
“Furthermore, divine son, if bodhisattvas possess four other qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
What are those four
They are  reveling in emptiness through the four concentrations,  reveling in skillful means through the six perfections,  reveling in wisdom through the five higher perceptions, and  reveling in magical power through unimpeded wisdom
Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
“Furthermore, Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess four other qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
What are those four
They are  not believing that the aggregates have the nature of awakening, even while seeking awakening in the aggregates,  pursuing awakening on the basis of the elements without believing that the elements have the nature of awakening,  pursuing awakening on the basis of the sense sources without thinking that the sense sources have the nature of awakening, and  pursuing awakening on the basis of all phenomena without believing that phenomena have the nature of awakening
Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
“Furthermore, Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess four other qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
What are those four
They are  knowing that all phenomena dwell within the limit of reality due to the immutable nature,  understanding that all phenomena abide in suchness due to the sameness of the three times,  knowing that all phenomena are subsumed within the realm of phenomena due to their unadulterated characteristics, and  comprehending that all phenomena have the nature of space due to their nature of sameness
Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
When this teaching on acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena was given, five thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, an
the divine son Guardian of Light Rays reached acceptance of phenomena concordant with the truth
At the conclusion of this Dharma teaching, the Blessed One said to venerable Ānanda
“Ānanda, did you receive this Dharma teaching on the questions of the kiṃnara king Druma—the discourse about the gateway that shows how to train by means of the perfections?
replied Ānanda
“Blessed One,” “I have received this Dharma teaching due to the power of the Buddha
Oh! Blessed One, this Dharma teaching that establishes the profound nature, has an excellent meaning, and is adorned by excellent words, is magnificent and amazing
Blessed One, there are no Dharma gateways that have not been included by the Blessed One in this Dharma teaching
Blessed One, whatever understanding I had of the Dharma previously has now increased a hundred thousand times based on this Dharma teaching
Blessed One, I think that if hearing this Dharma teaching can cause such an understanding of the Dharma to arise in someone like me—who has limited understanding, who has the lesser capacity aimed at the faultless state of the vehicle of the hearers, and who is misguided
it is needless to say that hearing this Dharma teaching will lead to complete understanding of the Dharma for bodhisattva great beings who are proper vessels in their boundless wisdom, have capacities as vast as oceans, possess all the jewels of the Dharma, and act as spiritual friends to all beings without being asked!
said the Blessed One
“Ānanda,” “The light emitted by a single hair of the Thus-Gone One’s body eclipses all sunlight and moonlight in this great trichiliocosm
Still, Ānanda, the light emitted from all the pores of hair on the Thus-Gone One’s body does not match a hundredth fraction of the light of insight
It does not match a thousandth fraction, a hundred thousandth fraction, a millionth fraction, or a trillionth fraction. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, example, or illustration comes close
Why is that so
Because all light originates from the light of insight
Ānanda, if noble sons and daughters possess that light of insight—the light of insight of the thus-gone ones
they will possess the light of insight by which the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas know the thoughts and concepts of all past, present, and future beings
Ānanda, you should know that those who listen to this Dharma teaching, develop trust in it, keep it in mind, hold it, read it, comprehend it, fully teach it to others, correctly understand it, and practice it accordingly are sublime beings who will never forget the mind set on awakening but will exert themselves in ripening beings. They will don the armor of great love and compassion, defeat demons and opponents, and proceed toward the seat of awakening.
Then venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, how much merit is generated by a noble son or daughter who is devoted to this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, who keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, comprehends it, and fully teaches it to others?
replied the Blessed One
“Ānanda,” “imagine that a noble son or daughter practices generosity by, in the morning, filling this entire great trichiliocosm with the seven precious substances and offering this to the stream enterers, the once returners, the nonreturners, the worthy ones, the solitary buddhas, and the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas
Similarly, imagine that he or she practices generosity by filling, at noon, during the afternoon, at dusk, during nighttime, and at dawn, all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm with the seven precious substances and offering this to all of them. Then, imagine that he or she practices generosity on that scale for a year, for a hundred years, for a thousand years, and for a hundred thousand years
What do you think Ānanda, would that noble son or daughter generate a lot of merit on that basis?
“Blessed One, the amount of merit generated would be huge! It would be immeasurable
Blissful One, the merit generated would be boundless
Blessed One, the heap of merit generated from doing this for one day is immeasurable, to say nothing of the heap of merit generated by practicing such generosity for a hundred thousand years!
“Ānanda, think about this and understand this point
if someone who strives to reach awakening, to turn the wheel of Dharma, and to liberate beings is devoted to this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, and then keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, and comprehends it
such a noble son or daughter who follows the Great Vehicle will generate an amount of merit larger than that
That being so, what need is there to mention the merit generated by those who put it into practice in accordance with reality?
Why is that
Because, Ānanda, keeping in mind even a single verse of four lines from this Dharma teaching, holding it, reading it, comprehending it, and fully teaching it to others is known as generosity , an
that generosity surpasses all other forms of generosity
Generosity with the Dharma is the supreme form of generosity
assistance with the Dharma is the supreme form of assistance
the act of spreading the Dharma is the supreme form of action, an
the acquisition of the Dharma is the supreme form of acquisition
Why is that so
Because, Ānanda, generosity with the Dharma will cause afflictions to decrease whil
generosity with material things will merely support the body
Therefore, Ānanda, bodhisattvas who wish to reduce their afflictions should practice generosity with the Dharma authorized by the Buddha
Through this generosity with the Dharma, all extraordinary qualities will be attained
“The bodhisattvas who practice generosity with the Dharma will gain thirty-two excellent and valuable benefits
What are those thirty-two
 They will develop mindfulness.  They will develop intelligence.  They will develop understanding
 Their desires will decrease.  Their anger will decrease.  Their ignorance will decrease.  They will overcome the afflictions in themselves and others
 They will please many beings.  The gods will proclaim their praises.  They will be protected by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas
 They will receive alms after performing service.  They will receive Dharma robes, alms, bedding, medicine, and provisions
 Their renown, repute, and praise will spread in the ten directions.  They will not be harmed by nonhumans.  They will be praised by the blessed buddhas
 They will guard the sacred Dharma.  They will uphold the sacred Dharma of the blessed buddhas
 They will not be frightened by any of the lower realms.  It will not be difficult for them to be reborn as gods and humans.  They will continuously behold the buddhas.  They will continuously venerate the Saṅgha
 They will remember their previous lives.  They will be reborn into pure buddha realms
 They will never be born with impaired faculties.  They will attain the thirty-two major marks of great beings.  They will manifest the seeds of magnificent retention
 They will acquire the cause of uninterrupted eloquence.  They will be served by wise beings.  They will acquire the cause of great insight.  They will quickly attain the light of the Dharma
 Improper contemplation will not arise in their minds
 They will surpass all forms of mundane generosity related to material things and acquire the inexhaustible Dharma treasure
Ānanda, if bodhisattvas practice generosity with the Dharma, they will acquire those thirty-two excellent and extraordinary qualities.
Then, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Blessed one
“Blessed One, I will also uphold this Dharma teaching
After the Blessed One has passed into nirvāṇa, I will ensure that beings who are proper recipients hear it. I will guard them and ensure that they have faith in it
Why
Because, Blessed One, I am pursuing those excellent qualities and the accumulation of merit.
At that moment, the Blessed One applauded Śakra, lord of the gods
He said, “Kauśika, the lion’s roar by which you have vowed in front of me to uphold the sacred Dharma is excellent, excellent
Kauśika, as long as my sacred Dharma endures, whenever the gods and the demigods are fighting, this root of virtue will cause the demigods to be defeated and the gods to be victorious in battle
This, Kauśika, is due to the fact that this Dharma teaching is excellent
Kauśika, not apprehending any phenomenon is the gift of fearlessness
Kauśika, whenever the slightest fear arises, it invariably originates in apprehending and dwelling on the view of the transitory collection
Kauśika, those who are free from apprehension uphold the sacred Dharma.
Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, I will renounce the limitless modes of dwelling in the bliss of concentration, an
I will go to listen to the Dharma in all the villages, cities, towns, provinces, countries, and royal capitals where this Dharma teaching is practiced
In those places, I will protect, guard, and support all those who preach the Dharma rightfully
Why
Because, Blessed One, the hearers, the solitary buddhas, Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, and the universal monarchs originate from this Dharma.
The four great kings then said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, we, the four great kings, and the great hearers of the Blessed One, will strive to protect, guard, and support this Dharma teaching to ensure that it endures for a long time
Our retinues will ensure that those who do not trust the Buddha and his teachings develop faith and exert themselves for the sake of protecting the teaching of the Thus-Gone One
Blessed One, we will now recite the following secret mantra words to protect the monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners who exert themselves in the teachings of the Buddha, as well as those who trust and guard the teaching of the Blessed One. These secret mantra words will subjugate beings such as yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and kumbhāṇḍas, as well as humans, nonhumans, and all those who are hostile toward the teaching of the Buddha

Then, the Blessed One said to the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Divyamauli
“Sublime beings, I entrust and place in your hands this awakening that I have accomplished over countless eons, to ensure that it endures for a long time without vanishing.
They both replied
“Blessed One, after the Blessed One has passed into nirvāṇa, we shall both uphold and propagate this Dharma teaching
We shall place this Dharma teaching in the hands of those who teach the Dharma and those noble sons and daughters who have created roots of virtue
We shall look after them to make sure that they trust and uphold this discourse
Blessed One, in the future, when beings hear this Dharma teaching and keep it in mind, hold it, read it, comprehend it, and carry it, it will be known to be due to the blessings of the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Divyamauli.
At that moment, the evil Māra, who was present in the assembly, started to shed tears and wail
He said to the Blessed One
“Blessed One, your Dharma teachings, starting with the vehicle of the hearers, have never ever given me goosebumps
However, this Dharma teaching that the Blessed One has taught—the seal of the bodhisattvas blessed by the thus-gone ones, the entrance to the path of awakening of all bodhisattvas, the support for all beings—has caused me such painful misery and made me weak
Blessed One, please reach out to me
Please stop expounding this Dharma teaching that causes me such painful misery!
replied the Blessed One
“Evil One,” “there are many beings like you who do not trust such a profound teaching, and there are only a few who do, so do not be distressed and stop wailing
Evil One, for example, beings who trust this profound Dharma teaching are as many as a pinch of dust taken from the surface of the earth, whil
beings who are not devoted to this profound Dharma teaching are as numerous as all the particles of dust on the entire earth
All those beings are like you
all the beings from innumerable realms are like you, so you should be happy, Evil One!
When this Dharma teaching was delivered, countless beings set out for awakening
ninety-two thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena
eighty-four thousand beings purified the spotless and stainless Dharma eye with respect to phenomena, an
the minds of eight thousand monks became free from defilements without any further appropriation
This great trichiliocosm shook in six ways and was bathed in a dazzling light
A rain of divine flowers fell from the sky, an
the melodies of hundreds of thousands of instruments resounded everywhere, without anyone playing them
Billions of gods residing in the sky exclaimed, “Oh, we have just witnessed a second turning of the wheel of Dharma in Jambudvīpa
The benefit for beings that has been accomplished by the Blessed One revealing and explaining this Dharma teaching is far greater than that of the turning of the Dharma wheel in the city of Vārāṇasī—and the maturation of beings is also greater
All the beings who will retain this Dharma teaching and hold it, read it, comprehend it, fully teach it to others, or even write it down and carry it, will also be turning the wheel of Dharma!
Then, the bodhisattva Maitreya, the bodhisattva Divyamauli, and venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One
“Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teaching? How should it be remembered?
replied the Blessed One
“Noble sons,” “you should remember this Dharma teaching as The Questions of the Kiṃnara King Druma—The Definitive Teaching on the Perfections . You should also remember it as The Precious Chapter on the Sacred Dharma .
When the Blessed One had spoken, the bodhisattva Maitreya, the bodhisattva Divyamauli, venerable Ānanda, and the world with its gods, humans, and demigods, rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One and were delighted
This concludes the Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra “ The Questions of the Kiṃnara King Druma .

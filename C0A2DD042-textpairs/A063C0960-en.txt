“What can we do?
“ ‘Nārāyaṇa thought, “If he thinks about this, he will definitely decide against making a gift, so I will put divinely inspired speech into his mouth.” 
“Come here, brahmin
What is your wish?” 
‘The brahmin answered
“I ask for two steps of ground.” 
‘I said, “Great brahmin, if you are asking for two steps, I will give you three.” 
‘The dwarf accepted this gift, saying, “This is auspicious.
’“Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara made the following prophecy to Bali, the lord of the asuras
Thus, guru, give me the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās
They will go to the realm of Sukhāvatī, and listen to the Dharma from Tathāgata Amitābha
through which I will quickly achieve the highest complete enlightenment and be a samyaksaṃbuddha
Turn the twelve wheels of the Dharma
The beings who remember your name will have good thoughts
Free all beings from the suffering of saṃsāra
When those who have been born in Kālasūtra, Raurava, Avīci, and in the city of the pretas remember your name, they will be freed from the great suffering of the lower existences
Give me the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās
He accepted it along with a gift of water, sesame, and gold, and then vanished
Be a home for the homeless.
The dharmabhāṇaka answered
“The six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās is a recitation that is hard to find
It is an unbreakable vajra recitation
It is a recitation of the highest wisdom
It is an unsurpassable recitation
It is a recitation that brings liberation
It is a recitation of unceasing wisdom
“ ‘Śukra said to me
It is a recitation of the pure wisdom of the tathāgatas
“Rishi King, I said that this was a man of doom who had come, but you did not pay heed to what I said
It is a recitation that eliminates desire, anger, stupidity, and the sufferings of saṃsāra
It is a recitation of skill in all methods
So may you experience the result of your actions!
“ ‘Be my refuge, holder of beautiful lotuses. 
It is a recitation of dhyāna, liberation, samādhi, and samāpatti
It is a recitation of entry into all Dharmas
It is a recitation continuously yearned for by the devas
They are ordained into those who stare at the sun, the followers of Maheśvara
You have taken all the ground that can be taken
What can I do?” 
“ ‘Then I, lord of the asuras, said to him
“Whatever you command, that I will do.
but those deities do not bring liberation
they are not protector
nor is theirs the conduct that is to be followed
The Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas took away the maidens
I, lord of the asuras, became faint, grew dizzy, fell headlong, and said, “What have I done? I have taken poison with my own hand!
to the one who has an omniscient buddha upon his head
to the one who brings relief to many beings
to the one who has compassion for the inferior and desolate
to the one who has illuminated the world
to the one who is a supreme king of healing
to the one who is a perfectly pure being
to the one who has the supreme attainment of yoga
to the one who has perfect liberation
to the one who is a lover of liberation
Even she places her palms together and pays homage to the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, let alone the tathāgatas, arhats, samyaksaṃbuddhas, and the hosts of bodhisattvas
to the one who is like a wish-fulfilling jewel; to the one who protects the treasure of the Dharma
“Noble son, this is an essence, like rice
The Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, and the others took away the golden lion thrones, the divine parasols, the bejeweled shoes, the clothing, the jewelry, the bejeweled golden armlets, and the tawny cows, destroying the offering site
Why say more about its other virtues
“What does it mean that it is conceived of as a central essence
It can be conceived of as being like the essence of rice
When it is dried, we pound it with a pestle to remove the chaff
In that way, all other yogas are like husks
and from among all yogas, the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās is like the rice
“I was about to make an excellent offering, but I made an unfortunate offering that has resulted in this bondage
If we die in chains, the way of the kṣatriyas will come to an end
but if we die on the battlefield, we will be reborn in the higher realms.
“ ‘Then all the great kings returned to their own cities and made preparations with many horse-drawn chariots
Those who just touch it with their clothes will attain the level of irreversibility
Noble son, that is what the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās is like
In your buddha realm there will not be the word desire
Those who recite that name are rare
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin then said to the dharmabhāṇak
“Give me the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās.
The dharmabhāṇaka thought and thought about this. Then a voice came from the sky saying, “Give him the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās!
The dharmabhāṇaka wondered where this voice had come from
Again there came the voice from the sky, saying, “This bodhisattva has undergone many hardships. Give him the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās!
The dharmabhāṇaka looked up into the sky an
there will not be the word anger
there will not be the word ignorance
and you will come into possession of the six-syllable mahāvidyā.
“ ‘While they prepared their very precious chariots and weapons
“Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara began to teach the Dharma. 
‘Listen, great king
When their feet are cut through on the great road of razors, as they lift that foot another foot will replace it
“ ‘He said, “I have come a long way.
“ ‘The guard stationed there said, “Brahmin dwarf, you can’t enter.
“ ‘Then the guard asked, “Brahmin, where do you come from?
“ ‘He answered, “I have come to the rishi king from Candradvīpa.
“ ‘I, the lord of the asuras, asked, “What is it that he requires?
Then Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin reverently placed his palms together to receive it
“ ‘At the time of death, there will be no one to protect them
When they are separated from their lives they will look back at Jambudvīpa
They will see the great river filled with pus and blood
Oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ
As soon as this was given, the earth shook in six ways
You will guide all the asuras
the samādhi named Established in the Entry to Liberation
“ ‘I asked, “What can we do?
the samādhi named Illuminating Everywhere
and the samādhi named Holding the Dharma
Those are the samādhis he attained
“ ‘Śukra, who was renowned as my upādhyāya, was also present at this time and said to me, “This is a person who brings doom. He will certainly cause you an obstacle.
As soon as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin had obtained the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, he offered the four continents, completely filled with the seven jewels, as payment to that upādhyāya
As soon as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin had obtained the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, he offered the four continents, completely filled with the seven jewels, as payment to that upādhyāya
The dharmabhāṇaka said
“ ‘I now confess my first bad action
“There is no payment required for even one of the syllables, let alone the six syllables of the mahāvidyā, nor will I take anything from you
There were also many trees made of coral, many blossom-covered trees
Their trunks were red, and their leaves were made of gold and silver
noble son. You are a bodhisattva, a noble being, with no one higher, and you are my pupil, noble son.
I tore out the hearts of the kṣatriya wives
with many hundreds of thousands of strings of pearls
slaughtered the boys and girls
with silk, with monastic robes, and with clusters of garlands
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin bowed his head to the feet of the dharmabhāṇaka and departed
bound all the great kṣatriyas in stocks and shackles, and took them to a copper cave
I imprisoned many hundreds of thousands of kṣatriyas in that copper cave
‘Noble son, he is coming here.’
Then the Bhagavat, the tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Śākyamuni asked
I fastened the legs and arms of those kṣatriyas, such as the Khasas and Pāṇḍavas, with iron chains and iron pegs to keep them in that cave
“ ‘I made doors for the cave
the first door was made of wood
“Noble son, did you find what you sought?
the second door was made of acacia
“Bhagavat, it happened, as the Bhagavat knows.
the third door was made of bronze
the fourth door was made of copper
the fifth door was made of iron
the sixth door was made of silver
and the seventh door was made of gold
Then I heaped seven mountains, one on top of the other, in front of the golden door. 
‘Then I went in search of Daśarathaputra, one day in the form of a beggar
Seventy-seven times ten million samyaksaṃbuddhas gathered there
and those tathāgatas recited this dhāraṇī
one day in the form of a bee
one day in the form of a pig
transforming into a different form each day, but I did not see him
“ ‘Then, after contemplating, I began to make my offerings
“Noble son, those are the words I heard Tathāgata Vipaśyin say
“ ‘They replied, “We are alive, Bhagavat.
They also see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
They see the seven tathāgatas that are at the level of nirvāṇa
When they remember it, they realize nirvāṇa
“When those bodhisattvas have entered their many-storied palaces
“Within each of the many-storied palaces there is a precious wish-granting jewel named Śārada, that provides each bodhisattva with everything he needs
On the sides there are extremely beautiful gardens with divine precious jewels and adorned with many very beautiful and delightful walkways and bathing pools
Rubies adorn the sides of each mountain
Each mountain has , peaks
Within that pore named Sūryaprabha there are ten thousand mountains of gol
“Beyond that pore there is the pore named Sūryaprabha, in which many millions of trillions of bodhisattvas dwell
That was the dhāraṇī recited by seventy-seven times ten million samyaksaṃbuddhas
Namaḥ saptanām saṃyak­saṃbuddha­koṭinām tadyathā Oṁ cale cule cunde svāhā. [The homage by seven times ten million samyaksaṃbuddhas is like this: Oṁ cale cule cunde svāhā.
When they see him, faith arises in their minds
After that has occurred, the bodhisattvas leave the many-storied palaces
However, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
“ ‘At that time, I had invited a thousand kings, a hundred thousand brahmins, and many hundreds of thousands of kṣatriyas
and I became arrogant on seeing that I was their sole ruler
Then some go to their walkways
some go to the gardens of precious wish-granting jewels
some go to the bathing pools
and some go to the sides of the mountains, which are made of precious ruby jewels
“When they arrive there, they sit cross-legged
sitting up straight, and establish themselves in focused mindfulness
Noble son, such are the bodhisattvas who live in that pore
is adorned with various jewels
Each one has eighty thousand peaks
Those kings of mountains are like that
many bejeweled lion thrones of silver and gold
many thousands of divine yak-tail whisks, parasols, shoes adorned with gold, and bejeweled gold diadems
I had prepared divine food with supreme flavors
“ ‘I had continuously prepared bejeweled bells of gold and silver
“ ‘I had prepared numerous kinds of food and drink
“ ‘I had prepared many hundreds of thousands of herds of cows along with herders
“ ‘I had prepared numerous heaps of clothing and jewelry
and some are made of crystal
some are made of emeralds
some are made of rubies
some are made of precious sapphire jewels
some are made of gold
some are made of silver
“Noble son, there are , mountains in that pore
Some are made of diamonds
“Noble son, beyond that there is the pore named Mahoṣadhī in which many millions of trillions of bodhisattvas live who have first developed bodhicitta
They have no other thought concerning their bodies
They remain at all times in contemplation of nirvāṇa
They are not stained by the afflictions of saṃsāra
They have none of the sufferings of saṃsāra
“In that way those bodhisattvas live on these kings of mountains without thinking about food or drink
It fulfills whatever wishes the bodhisattvas make
In the middle of those mountains there is a precious jewel named Padmāvabhāsa
Within that pore named Indrarāja there are eighty thousand mountains made of divine gold and jewels
“Beyond that there is the pore named Indrarāja, in which many millions of trillions of irreversible bodhisattvas dwell
and is extremely beautified by various delightful features
“Pratyekabuddhas live on these kings of mountains
They have the jingling sounds of silver and gold bells
They are hung with Kaśika cloth
That is what my parents said to me
adorned with divine jewelry
“Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, those are the sufferings I experienced when I was a head merchant
Son, you have brought us delight like a cooling breeze.
very beautiful, similar to and rivaling divine maidens
and someone to be our protector when we are dead
someone to make food offerings to us when we have died
We only need a walking stick for when we are old
We do not need wealth
‘Son, we have got you back alive
My parents said
“Then I sat with my parents and told them everything that had happened
My father and mother embraced me and wept, and their tears dissolved their cataracts so they regained their sight
I journeyed toward my home and eventually arrived there
When we reached the shore, I circumambulated Bālāha, the king of horses, three times, bowed to him, and departed
“I arrived in Jambudvīpa alone
When they had fallen into the water, the rākṣasīs pulled them out and ate them
Hearing the noise, the merchants turned round and looked back at them, and when they did so they fell headlong into the water
weeping and wailing pitifully
When we were all mounted, the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island came running after us, making a great clamor
“We agreed to do as he said. Then first I alone mounted him, and then the five hundred merchants mounted him
None of you must turn your eyes toward Siṃhala Island.
Bālāha, the king of horses, said to us, ‘None of you must look back at Siṃhala Island
“The merchants said, ‘We are going to cross over to the far shore.’
“He asked three times, ‘Who is going to cross over to the far shore? Who is going to cross over to the far shore? Who is going to cross over to the far shore?
When he shook his body, the island of Siṃhala shook
“Bālāha, the king of horses, was enjoying the sarvaśetāna herb. When he had finished enjoying it, he rolled back and forth on the golden sand and shook his body
“On the peaks there live gandharvas who continually play music, which emanates from that pore
“Those bodhisattvas who have first developed bodhicitta contemplate emptiness and featurelessness
‘Alas, there is suffering
the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death
the suffering of being separated from the beloved and pleasant; the suffering of encountering the disliked and unpleasant
They do not experience the sufferings of saṃsāra and are satisfied by perfect happiness
the suffering of being born in Avīci
the suffering of being born in Kālasūtra
their bodies straight, establishing themselves in focused mindfulness, dwelling in the mountains
Noble son, beyond that there is the pore named Cittarāja, in which live many millions of trillions of pratyekabuddhas
They perform miracles of fire, heat, rain, and lightning
They all dwell on the noble eightfold path and always aspire to the Dharma
“Noble son, there are a hundred thousand mountains in that pore
All those kings of mountains are made of the seven jewels
There are a variety of wish-granting trees on those kings of mountains
Whenever the gandharvas wish for something, their wishes are fulfilled
Some have one clairvoyance
“Beyond the pore named Suvarṇa, there is a pore named Kṛṣṇa, within which a trillion rishis dwell
some have two clairvoyances
some have three clairvoyances
They are studded with a variety of jewels and hung with a variety of adornments
some have four clairvoyances
some have five clairvoyances
and some have the six clairvoyances
“Within that pore the ground is silver and the mountains are gold with silver peaks adorned by rubies
There are seventy-seven such mountains
and on each of those mountains live eighty thousand rishis
They are hung with diadems, earrings, garlands, armlets, and one hundred and eight-string and sixty-four-string pearl necklaces
Some are filled with water that has the eight qualities
and some are completely filled with divine flowers
The Bhagavat said
“Noble son, why are you astonished?
Whenever they wish for something, their wishes are fulfilled.
and they teach the perfection of wisdom
and divine clothing appears
divine aromatic substances appear
they teach the perfection of meditation
they teach the perfection of diligence
When they remember the name the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, food with supreme divine flavors appears
they teach the perfection of patience
they teach the perfection of conduct
they teach the perfection of generosity
The deer and birds contemplate deeply in that way
“In those many-storied palaces, there are golden stairs beautified by delightful jewels of various kinds
They see human beings undergoing many kinds of suffering
and shining with moonstone gems
hung with strings of bells
“ ‘I had also prepared an offering of a thousand young women with excellent complexions, who were full-bodied
Within that pore there are many hundreds of thousands of ninety-nine-story palaces made of divine gold and jewels
decorated with pearls, cloth, and garlands
“Within that pore the ground is made of diamonds
There are hundreds of thousands of agarwood trees
There are many hundreds of thousands of sandalwood trees
“On those kings of mountains, there are many hundreds of thousands of wish-fulfilling trees
beautifully adorned with a variety of jewels
Within that pore there are , mountains
That pore is , yojanas wide
“Then, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, beyond that pore, last of all, there is the pore named Dhvajārāja
They teach various kinds of Dharma, continually teaching the humans who live in Jambudvīpa
“Bhagavat, is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara coming?
But again, Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
Noble son, that is the kind of blessing that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.
transforming it into a heap of ash
The noble Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara radiated blue, yellow, red, white, crystal, and silver light rays, and those light rays went to Jetavana
When they came there, they circled the Bhagavat three times
Then they left Jetavana Monastery and went to the great Avīci hell
When they arrived there, they cooled the great Avīci hell
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to the Bhagavat
Have you completely ripened beings?
Are you weary
“Noble son, are you tired
The Bhagavat, with the voice of the cuckoo, asked
I made an offering to a bad recipient
and I am now experiencing the result of that action
Even a handful of dust thrown toward an omniscient one transforms into amṛta
that brought me bondage in this lifetime
Those female gandharvas have excellent figures
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then left the realm of Sukhāvatī and went to Jetavana Monastery, and eventually arrived there
He went inside Jetavana Monastery, bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet, and sat to one side
“ ‘What kind of gift did I, Bali, make, with my queens and retinue
Then the asura king Bali, with tears, a darkened face, choking, with stuttering words and sighs, told Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara his story
and the upper half extends upward for , yojanas. Noble son, if Sumeru were to become a mass of birch bark
noble son, I could count each one of those grains
but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving
and the mustard would grow perfectly for one harvest
and those people in the four continents were to do no other work than growing mustard, and from time to time the king of the nāgas would send down rain
So it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in the realm of the asuras
and were they to be in one place with every facility for a deva’s eon, they would still be unable to calculate that aggregation of merit
Be a refuge to those who are weary of saṃsāra
“Those beings sat before Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and requested him
‘Show the path to blind beings
Be a protector and refuge to beings who have no protector
Be a father and mother to those who do not have a father and mother
Be a lamp for the darkness of the three lower existences
Be aware of us and show us, with great compassion, the path to liberation
The beings who have obtained and always remember your name are happy
they are free from this kind of suffering that we experience.
When they heard it, they reached an irreversible level and were established in the highest happiness
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then left for another land, which was made of iron
where he approached the asura king Bali
Many trillions of female gandharvas live within it
The Bhagavat accepted the lotuses and placed them on his left
The Bhagavat gave his approval, saying, “Excellent
noble son. That you repeatedly make these requests is excellent, excellent
“Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, it is like this: Beyond the Kṛṣṇa pore there is a pore named Ratnakuṇḍala
Then the deva Maheśvara came to the Bhagavat, bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet, and said
“ ‘On this day, my life has borne fruit
On this day, my wishes have been fulfilled
On this day, my wishes have been fulfilled
For actually seeing you has brought me happiness for all my lifetimes.
“Bhagavat, I pray that you give me a prophecy.
“At this, the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, issued forth into the ears of those beings
The Bhagavat said
“Go, noble son, to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who will give you the prophecy.
who has a lotus face
who loves the lotus
They will not be reborn as an untouchable or of mixed caste
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara asked the deva Maheśvara
“Noble son, why are you silent?
who has a beautiful lotus in his hand, who has the splendor of lotuses
The deva Maheśvara answered
“I request the prophecy of my unsurpassable true enlightenment.
Avalokiteśvara said
they will not be reborn as someone with defective senses; they will not be reborn as lame, hunchbacked, with a deformed nose, a goiter, or a cleft lip, nor with leprosy
Their bodies will not be afflicted by illness
They will have health, great strength, and clear faculties.
That was the prophecy that Umādevī received
they are not afflicted by the suffering of anger
and they are not afflicted by the suffering of stupidity
Their bodies do not experience the sufferings that humans do
the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Umeśvara.
“Sister, your realm will be on the southern slope of Himavat, the king of mountains.” You will be the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world
“Noble son, in the world named Vivṛta, you will be the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Bhasmeśvara.
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to her
I pray that you free me from the suffering of the dark impurities in the womb, and from always being owned.
“I pray that you free me from this inferior female body of a woman
who creates excellent minds
who brings beings to nirvāṇa
who travels around
who has the splendor of beautiful lotuses
who has a beautiful lotus in his hand
This, noble son, is entitled ‘the Maheśvara episode.’ 
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat
“Bhagavat, Avalokiteśvara has come
I who was blind can now see
Today my life has borne fruit
Today my wishes have come true
Today my wishes have been fulfilled
Today my path to enlightenment has been cleansed
I have been taught correct thought, the dharmakāya, and nirvāṇa.
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin then said to the Bhagavat
The Bhagavat said
“Bhagavat, I pray that you teach today the special qualities of Avalokiteśvara.
“Noble son, those pores cannot be perceived
The Bhagavat said, “Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, it like this
“Thus, noble son, no one can see or hear Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
and therefore he casts no shadow in the midst of all phenomena
as liberated from existence
as being from the good family
as being imperceptible; and as being wise
as having great wisdom
as residing on the level of nirvāṇa
“ ‘Ratnapāṇi, in that way, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma of nirvāṇa to the asuras and shows them the entranceway to nirvāṇa.
“Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi bowed his head to Bhagavat Śikhin’s feet and departed.
“He then left the land of gol
and went to the land of silver
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to the four-legged beings who lived there
“Avalokiteśvara had gone to the land of gold and taught the eightfold noble path, the Dharma that teaches nirvāṇa, to the upside-down beings who lived there
At that time, I heard Tathāgata Viśvabhū describe the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
“At that time, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, I was a rishi who taught patience and lived in a cliff among the mountains where people did not go
“In a later time, there was the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Viśvabhū
No tathāgata can see the body of his true nature, let alone Samantabhadra or other bodhisattvas
“Those beings sat before Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and requested him
‘You must listen with perfect, pure thought to this Dharma teaching on contemplating nirvāṇa, on turning the mind to nirvāṇa.’ Then Avalokiteśvara taught them the Dharma
You have prepared various paths for going to Sukhāvatī
Hearing it will purify them of the five actions with immediate results on death
“Those who turn their minds to this king of the sūtras will have happiness in this world
with palms placed together, come to listen to this Dharma teaching from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
“ ‘Then all other asuras, with loving minds and peaceful minds
“You must listen.
“Noble son, all the tathāgatas have spent sixteen eons wandering in search of this six-syllable mahāvidyā, so therefore how could bodhisattvas know it
It is the supreme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
“If someone traveled throughout this realm of beings, there would be found a few who know the six-syllable mahāvidyā
and if all the men, women, boys, and girls who live in the four continents were to become scribes, and if they were to write on the limitless, endless extent of Mount Sumeru as birch bark, I would be able to count every single letter, but, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
Those beings who continually possess the six-syllable mahāvidyā and are dedicated to repeating it are meritorious
and if the vast ocean were to become an inkwell
If the king of mountains Sumeru were to become birch bark
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the asuras there in the form of an asura
When they repeat it, bhagavats and buddhas to the number of sand grains in ninety-nine Ganges Rivers gather around them
bodhisattvas to the number of atoms gather around them, and they reach the entranceway to the six perfections
He teaches them the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
“The devas of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise also gather there
the samādhi named Hundred Retinues
The four mahārājas guard the four directions
the samādhi named Ocean Deep
Many millions of trillions of nāgas such as Nāga King Sāgara, Nāga King Anavatapta, Nāga King Takṣaka, and Nāga King Vāsuki guard the ground
‘Bhagavat, this is extraordinarily marvelous
the samādhi named Extinguishing Avīci
I have never seen nor heard of such a thing before
the samādhi named Creating Inexhaustibility
Also, the yakṣas from above the earth guard the open space above them
“Ten million tathāgatas reside in each pore of that noble son
Not even the tathāgatas have what Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has
’“Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi said to Bhagavat Śikhin
That, noble son, is how Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara completely ripens beings and teaches them the Dharma of nirvāṇa
He teaches the Dharma in whatever particular form a being should be taught through
He teaches the Dharma in the form of parents to beings who are to be taught by their parents
‘Noble son, those who wear this six-syllable mahāvidyā on their body or on their throat will be known to have a body that is a vajra body
“A noble son or noble daughter who repeats the six-syllable mahāvidyā will have indestructible mental brilliance
He or she will become a pure mass of wisdom
That person will have great love and great compassion
That person will complete the six perfections each day
That person will receive the consecration of a vidyādhara cakravartin
“Those who inhale that person’s breath, whether in love or in anger, will become irreversible bodhisattvas
He teaches the Dharma in the form of an arhat to beings who are to be taught by an arhat
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a bodhisattva to beings who are to be taught by a bodhisattva
They will quickly attain the highest complete enlightenment and be samyaksaṃbuddhas
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Maheśvara to beings who are to be taught by Maheśvara
“All those who just touch that person with their clothing will become bodhisattvas in their last existence
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Nārāyaṇa to beings who are to be taught by Nārāyaṇa
and even the deer, birds, oxen, donkeys, and so on, who see that person, will all become bodhisattvas in their last existence
They will not experience the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, death, and separation from the beloved
They will become inconceivable yogins.
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Brahmā to beings who are to be taught by Brahmā
In that way the Bhagavat encouraged the repetition of the six-syllable mahāvidyā
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Śakra to beings who are to be taught by Śakra
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Āditya to beings who are to be taught by Āditya
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Candra to beings who are to be taught by Candra

which fills the treasury of the Dharma
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a king to beings who are to be taught by a king
which uproots saṃsāra and the five existences; which brings the hells and afflictions to an end
which takes those who have become animals to a higher existence
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a paṇḍita to beings who are to be taught by a paṇḍita
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a king’s soldier to beings who are to be taught by a king’s soldier
They will be completely freed from the sufferings of aging, death, and illness
They will be freed from the unavoidable sufferings of saṃsāra
“When they have talked about the six perfections
and they talk about the perfection of wisdom
they talk about the perfection of meditation
they talk about the perfection of diligence
they talk about the perfection of patience
they talk about the perfection of conduct
Some of the walkways are made of gold
Some of the walkways are made of silver
All around the walkways there are wish-fulfilling trees that have red trunks and leaves made of silver and gold
and that are hung with divine ornaments
hung with armlets
the samādhi named Abode of Beings
“Thus, noble son, it is difficult to find Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
Remembering his name, they receive all kinds of things
“Noble son, the kiṃnaras who rejoice in the Dharma in that way continually remember the name of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
born in Agnighaṭa, born in Vajraśaila, and born in the city of the pretas. Those beings have the greatest suffering.
There are those who are born in Kālasūtra, born in Raurava, born in the great hell of Hāhava
Oh, the suffering! Separation from the desired and beloved and encountering the undesired and the disliked is extremely unendurable suffering
Oh, the suffering! Poverty is also suffering
‘Oh, the suffering! Oh, the suffering! Death is suffering
who is the father and mother of all beings
who brings freedom from fear to all beings
who reveals the path to all beings
who is a kalyāṇamitra for all beings
Noble son, this is what Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is like
“Noble son, it is difficult to obtain his name
the samādhi named Complete Illumination of the World
the samādhi named Scattering
the samādhi named Creating Yoga
the samādhi named Well Taught
the samādhi named Vajra Womb
the samādhi named Facing the Dharma
the samādhi named Day-Maker’s Sublime Illumination
the samādhi named the Senses’ Sublime Illumination
the samādhi named Liberation from Anger
the samādhi named Liberation from the Senses
the samādhi named Continuous Sublime Gift
Those who remember the name that is the six-syllable vidyāmantra will be reborn in those pores
the samādhi named Vajra Doorway
They will no longer continue to be in saṃsāra
teaches them the path to enlightenment, and teaches the Dharma in whatever form a being can be taught through
the samādhi named King’s Powers
the samādhi named Summit of Mental Brilliance
the samādhi named Endless Array
the samādhi named Hundred Strengths
They will go from one pore to another
living within those pores until they reach the level of nirvāṇa.
the samādhi named Manifesting
the samādhi named Great Brilliance
the samādhi named Being Patient
the samādhi named Lightning’s Illumination
the samādhi named Unadorning
the samādhi named Completely Defeating
Those who know that supreme essence know liberation.
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has many hundreds of thousands of samādhis
It is an inconceivable yoga and therefore difficult to obtain
Even the tathāgatas do not know it, let alone the bodhisattvas
‘Bhagavat, when will that powerful commitment be fulfilled?
“Noble son, no one knows the six-syllable mahāvidyā
It is an inconceivable yoga and therefore difficult to obtain
Even the tathāgatas do not know it, let alone the bodhisattvas
They talk about the perfection of generosity
Seated, they talk about the Dharma
There are many hundreds of thousands of bathing pools
Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has those samādhis
There are extremely beautiful and delightful divine celestial palaces of crystal and silver
Such are the celestial palaces that appear there
“Noble son, within that pore there are many wish-fulfilling trees, coral trees, sandalwood trees, and aromatic trees
Their bodies will feel no hunger or thirst
“When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Indra’s Way, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Ocean Deep
They will not know the suffering of being inside a womb
and some of the seven jewels
some of sapphires
some of rubies
some of crystal
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Sprinkling, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Treasury of Space
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Moon’s Sublime Illumination, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Sun’s Sublime Illumination
“When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Ascending Vajra, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Scattering
Noble son, such are the signs seen within that pore
some of gold
and I saw these different samādhis of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra and others
some of silver
Completely inspired by the taste of the Dharma, they will be reborn within a lotu
“When I was in the presence of that tathāgata, I heard that description of the qualities of Avalokiteśvara
Noble son, such are the kiṃnaras that live there
They will not become old or die. They will have no desire, anger, or stupidity
They are focused one-pointedly on the Dharma
remain in loving kindness
meditate on patience
contemplate nirvāṇa
The sufferings of saṃsāra will not afflict their bodies
and are saddened for humans
They will hear the Dharma by listening to Tathāgata Amitābha teach
“They have continuous faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha
Like white and pale yellow birds
like kings of geese moving with the speed of the wind, they will go to the realm of Sukhāvatī
“When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Sublime Gift, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Drying Up Avīci
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a tathāgata to beings who are to be taught by a tathāgata
“Then Tathāgata Krakucchanda said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra
‘Noble son, you have seen only a little of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s prowess
Even the tathāgatas do not have Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s prowess.
“That is what I heard Krakucchanda say.
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, such are the bodhisattvas within that pore
The Bhagavat replied
They think of nirvāṇa, they contemplate all the sufferings of saṃsāra, and after contemplating suffering they meditate on love
“The bodhisattvas walk each evening along these walkways while thinking about various aspects of the Mahāyāna
Along these walkways there are beautiful wish-fulfilling trees that have red trunks and leaves made of silver and gold; are adorned with divine adornments
’“Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin
‘Bhagavat, I have never seen nor heard of tathāgatas having the kind of accumulation of merit that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has, let alone bodhisattvas
“Noble son, those who hear the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, will not have the obscuration of previous karma
their merit would only be, as said before, equal to the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
I can calculate the accumulation of that merit, but I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
Some are filled with water that has the eight qualities
each of which has seventy bathing pools
Those who, enamored of another’s wife, have sexual intercourse with her
those who have killed their parents
those who have killed an arhat
those who have destroyed stūpas
those who have maliciously caused a tathāgata to bleed
Then they leave the celestial palaces and go each to their own walkways
“Bodhisattvas relax in those celestial palaces and discuss the Dharma
Noble son, they should not be known as ordinary beings
and adorned by a hundred thousand strings of pearls
having many kinds of visual delights
“ ‘Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, if stūpas for tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as atoms were made in divine gold and precious stones, and in one day the relics were placed in them all
On those kings of mountains, there dwell many millions of trillions of gandharvas
Those who hear the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, will have happiness
Bodhisattvas who have developed one-pointed minds dwell on their slopes
“Noble son, in that same way, this precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, burns up all bad karma
and each one has ninety thousand peaks adorned by gold
Each one is sixty thousand yojanas high
Then the nāga king Śatamukha comes from his residence and burns the grass, the bushes, the herbs, and the forests
some are on the ninth bhūmi
some are on the eighth bhūmi
some are on the seventh bhūmi
For example, during the summer, plants and forests become very green
some are on the sixth bhūmi
It eliminates all obscurations. It is like this
the merit that would be produced through those tathāgatas would be the same as that of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
some are on the fifth bhūmi
“Noble son, in that way, the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, burns up all bad karma. It makes it white
“ ‘Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, the ocean is , yojanas dee
and has an immeasurable expanse, but I can count each drop all the way down to Vaḍavāmukha
“ ‘Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, if it were to rain day and night on the four great continents for a twelve-month year, I could count each drop, but, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
but, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara came to Bhagavat Śikhin. He was holding lotus flowers, each with a thousand petals and a golden stem
‘Bhagavat, if I may ask for an answer to a question
how much merit has Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara accumulated?
and disappeared into the sky as a blazing mass of fire
some are on the fourth bhūmi
“Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin
some are on the third bhūmi
some are on the second bhūmi
Some are on the first bhūmi
bowed his head to the bhagavat’s feet, departed alone
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, having given this answer
“Noble son, this bodhisattva mahāsattva is inconceivable. He manifests inconceivable miracles
He has completely ripened many trillions of beings
He has led those beings onto the path to enlightenment
Having entered that path, they have gone to the realm of Sukhāvatī where they hear the Dharma from Tathāgata Amitābha.
He then spoke of the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
“Bhagavat Śikhin took the lotuses and placed them on his left
When a black cloth becomes white, that is like the accumulation of the Dharma
‘Bhagavat, why did this sign appear?
‘Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is coming from the realm of Sukhāvatī
I manifest this kind of sign when he is coming
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat
and those who delight in such bad actions will be freed from bad karma by the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display.
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
“Bhagavat, how can I know the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, which brings freedom from all bad karma?
The Bhagavat said
“Noble son, on the southern side of Sumeru, the king of mountains, the seven samyaksaṃbuddhas examine the extent of stains and stainlessness
I also am presently examining them
“A white cloth becomes black
and a black cloth becomes white
When the white cloth becomes black, that is like an accumulation of bad karma
They should be seen as irreversible bodhisattvas
“Bhagavat, I will go to those pores because I want to see them.
just as the element of space cannot be perceived
Noble son, those pores cannot be perceived, and they cannot be touched
When they die, twelve tathāgatas will come and reassure them, saying
When they play music, deer, birds, and so on contemplate deeply. They see the suffering and happiness of beings in saṃsāra and the way in which suffering is experienced in Jambudvīpa
You have heard the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras
“In each of those wish-fulfilling trees there live a hundred gandharvas
and their leaves are made of jewels and gold
and hung with bracelets
hung with one hundred and eight-string necklaces and sixty-four-string necklaces
The area around them is completely adorned by wish-fulfilling trees that are divine coral trees hung with divine adornments; hung with diadems and earrings
You will never again see birth, aging, sickness, and death
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes, a profusion of wish-granting trees appears
’“Then we all left the town
There is a rain of various flowers, a rain of precious stones—jewels, pearls, diamonds, beryl, conch, crystal, and coral—and there is a rain of divine cloth
a profusion of mango trees appears, star jasmine flowers and magnolia trees appear, ponds covered with flowers appear, and precious trees appear
the precious wheel, the precious horse, the precious elephant, the precious jewel, the precious wife, the precious householder, and the precious counselor
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes from the realm of Sukhāvatī, the entire world shakes six times.
‘Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is arriving
noble son, those beings will have happiness.
At this, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet and departed
Then Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin became silent
After they had departed, Brother Ānanda said to the Bhagavat
“Bhagavat, I pray that you teach us the vows of training.
There are no bones in those various locations
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then told that great king, ‘I must leave, for today many are gathering in the Jetavana Monastery.
There are no feces and urine
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara now radiated many blue, yellow, red, white, crystal, and silver light rays that reached Tathāgata Viśvabhū
before whom devas, nāgas, yakṣas, mahoragas, and humans had gathered
“From within that assembly of bodhisattvas the bodhisattva named Gaganagañja arose from his seat
What need is there to say more
bared one shoulder, and kneeling on his right knee and facing Bhagavat Viśvabhū, placed his palms together and addressed these words to him
and pools that were completely filled with flowers
Bhikṣus, a bhikṣu with incorrect conduct cannot establish the various locations for ordination, let alone make the fourth motion
“Then Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asked Bhagavat Viśvabhū
‘Bhagavat, is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara not coming?
They destroy the teaching
‘Noble son, he has left the palace of Bali, lord of the asuras, and is going to an extremely dreadful land named Tamondhakāra where there are no humans
Those who have incorrect conduct should not dwell among those who receive offerings
They should dwell outside the monastery
The saṅgha’s alms should not be given to them
They are not worthy to be in the saṅgha
They have no part of being a bhikṣu.
Brother Ānanda asked the Bhagavat
“Bhagavat, in what time will they become recipients of offerings?
There, noble son, the sun and moon do not shine
A wish-fulfilling jewel named Varada provides light in that place
“Many hundreds of thousands of yakṣas and rākṣasas live in that continent
They will see the monastery as their home
Sons and daughters will encircle them
Those who spit in places the saṅgha uses will be reborn in a sal tree forest as insects the size of the eye of a needle for twelve years
“They will also spit in the places the saṅgha uses, not knowing the karma that ripens from it
noble sons, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from even one four-line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
“Those who use the toothpicks of the saṅgha, which are prohibited to them, will be reborn as turtles, crocodiles, and fish
noble sons, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
“ ‘Noble sons, it is like this: For example, I know the number of atoms that exist, but
“Those who use the saṅgha’s sesame, rice, millet, horse gram, and other grains, which are not for them to eat, will be reborn in the city of the pretas
“Those who use the food of the saṅgha to feed dogs will be reborn in a low caste
with defective faculties
They will be like burned tree trunks, like standing skeletons covered with hair, with stomachs the size of mountains and mouths the size of a needle’s eye. They will experience that kind of physical suffering
Seated, he teaches the Dharma to the yakṣas and rākṣasas: “ ‘Listen
crippled and hunchbacked
and unable to look others in the face while begging
When they die, they will be reborn with diseased bodies
They will have blood and pus dripping from their bodies
“The yakṣas and rākṣasas lead him to a lion throne of divine gold and jewels, upon which he sits
the tendons in their bodies will shrink
When they stand up, red lumps of their flesh will fall onto the ground, and their bones will be exposed
They will experience that kind of suffering for many years, for many hundreds of thousands of years
“Those who use land exclusive to the saṅgha will be reborn in the Raurava great hell for twelve eons
Lumps of red hot iron will be squeezed into their mouths, burning them, destroying their lips and teeth, splitting their palates, burning their throats, and burning their hearts and all their entrails until there is nothing left but bones
Bhikṣus, at that time the winds of karma will blow, and although they have died they will come back to life
Then Yama’s guards will again seize them
Their karma will come; they will be under the power of their karma. Their tongues will become vast, and a hundred thousand plows will plow them
They will experience that kind of suffering in that hell for hundreds of thousands of years
“When they die and leave that hell, they will be reborn in the Agnighaṭa great hell
Yama’s guards will seize them and insert a hundred thousand needles into their tongues
Then, through the power of karma, they will be come back to life and will be hurled into a mass of flames
When they are cast out from that mass of flames, they will be hurled into the Vaitarāṇi River
When they die, they will be reborn in other hells
They will wander in that way for three eons. When they die and leave the hells, they will be reborn in Jambudvīpa as poor people, blind from birth
Therefore, Ānanda, protect the property of the saṅgha
“Bhikṣus, those who have the vows of training should have the three Dharma robes
One Dharma robe is worn by the saṅgha so that there will be confidence in the saṅgha
The second robe is for when one goes to the king’s palace
The third robe is for when one goes to the villages, towns, marketplaces, and hamlets
So the bhikṣus must have the three robes
“Those bhikṣus who have good conduct, who have good qualities, and who have wisdom should remember my words of instruction
The noble Mahāyāna sūtra, The Basket’s Display, is concluded
Translated and revised by the Indian paṇḍitas Jinamitra and Dānaśīla, and by Yeshé Dé, the translator and chief editor
The joyful Bhagavat had spoken these words, and the entire community and the world with its devas, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced in what the Bhagavat had said
The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans also departed
Then the mahāśrāvakas departed to their own buddha realms
Then Brother Ānanda bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet and departed
and will preserve the Bhagavat’s words of instruction.
will follow the Vinaya
“Bhagavat, every bhikṣu will remember these words of instruction given by the Bhagavat and will keep the pratimokṣa vows
Brother Ānanda said to the Bhagavat
noble sons, in that same way merit accumulates from one four-line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display.
There are remedies for poison, but there are no remedies for using the property of the saṅgha.
‘Noble sons, their accumulation of merit is immeasurable
“Then the yakṣas and rākṣasas asked Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
‘What kind of accumulation of merit is obtained by those beings who write out this precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display?’
Those who engage in writing out the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, are engaged in writing the eighty-four thousand compilations of the Dharma
“O you who are the treasurer of the Dharma
you are like an unfathomable ocean that is an accumulation of the treasure of amṛta
You are a repository within the human realm
They will become kings; they will become cakravartins who rule the four continents; they will give birth to thousands of brave heroic sons with perfect bodies and who defeat their adversaries
He went to where the dharmabhāṇaka was and bowed his head to his feet
Wherever they are reborn, in every life they will remember their previous lives
Their bodies will have an aroma like gośīrṣa sandalwood
From their mouths will come the scent of the blue lotus
Their bodies will be completely perfect
one hundred and eight-string and sixty-four-string necklaces for covering the shoulders
ear adornments
and finger rings
and also various flowers
and also various kinds of clothing: monastic robes, clothing commanded by the vidyādharas, and Kaśika cloth
various kinds of turmeric flowers
blue lotuses, red lotuses, night lotuses, white lotuses, tiger claw flowers and great tiger claw flowers, mañjuṣukas and mahāmañjuṣukas, udumbaras
Meritorious are those beings who live in Vārāṇasī, can see you, and always gather around you
The instant they see you, you burn up all their bad karma
You burn up all bad karma like a fire burns a forest, just through being seen
The tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas know of you
You liberate many beings who are bound in the bondage of saṃsāra
The dharmabhāṇaka said to him
“Noble son, do not create a cause for remorse
Some of the yakṣas and rākṣasas attained the result of becoming a once-returner
The others attained the result of becoming a non-returner
I lack the highest complete enlightenment, so give me the seed for enlightenment
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin grasped the dharmabhāṇaka’s feet tightly and said
“My senses are impaired, so be my eyes
I have lost the path, so show me the path
Do not go anywhere else
I am thirsty for the Dharma, so quench my thirst with the taste of the Dharma
We will build a stūpa of divine gold in Tamondhakāra
We will create a circumambulatory walkway of gold
The yakṣas and rākṣasas, resting cheeks on hands, brooded and said to each other
‘Our Avalokiteśvara is going to leave us, and we will not be able to talk about the Dharma with him
’“As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was leaving, the yakṣas and rākṣasas followed him
Noble son, just as the gold in the Jambu River does not become stained, someone who wears the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās on his body will have a body that is not polluted by desire, anger, or stupidity.
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to them, ‘It is too far for you to come, so you should go back
’“The yakṣas and rākṣasas bowed down at the feet of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and returned
“Then Avalokiteśvara vanished into the sky as a mass of flames.
“Avalokiteśvara then manifested in the form of a brahmin and went among the devas in the Śuddhāvāsa realms
Among those devas there was a deva named Sukuṇḍala who was poor and suffering. 
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
“Noble son, it is like this: those who possess the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās will attain one hundred and eight samādhis.
‘Brahmin, you definitely speak the truth
Who are you? Are you a deva or a human
and the samādhi named Complete Stability
the samādhi named Seeing All the Tathāgatas
the samādhi named Teaching the Six Perfections
the samādhi named Holding Great Meru
the samādhi named Rescuing from All Existences
the samādhi named Eternal Calf
the samādhi named Complete Liberation from Desire and Anger
and there are the miracles of Tathāgata Viśvabhū
the samādhi named Entering the Chariot of the Dharma
the samādhi named Adornment of Dhyāna
the samādhi named Entering All Dharmas
There are beautiful flowers
many kinds of bathing pools
many who have the qualities of right conduct and are worthy recipients for offerings
the samādhi named Scattering
the samādhi named Skillfulness in All Methods
the samādhi named Stable Conduct
the samādhi named Vajra Armor
the samādhi named Purification of Hells and Animals
“The noble son or noble daughter who repeats this six-syllable mahāvidyā will attain these samādhis
the samādhi named Revealing All Buddha Realms
If stūpas were made from precious divine gold for tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas equal in number to atoms, and if in one day they were all filled with their relics, the result ripening from that would only equal the result that ripens from one syllable of the six-syllable mahāvidyā, which has inconceivable qualities and brings liberation
‘It is a place that is delightful, filled with divine jewels, and completely beautified by divine wish-granting trees
“The brahmin answered
he has not followed the noble path.
His orange robes are filled with feces and urine
He is surrounded by his wife, sons, and daughters
and his behavior is poor
This dharmabhāṇaka’s conduct is poor
Noble son, do not fall from a bodhisattva bhūmi to be reborn in the lower existences
“Noble son, you should have no doubts when you see this dharmabhāṇaka
seen as a Dharma king; and seen as a savior of beings
“So Sukuṇḍala entered his divine palace and looked inside his pots
seen as a wish-fulfilling jewel
seen as a heap of jewels
seen as one who speaks the truth
He saw that some pots had become completely filled with priceless precious jewels
other pots had become completely filled with food that had the supreme flavors
and the left side of the divine palace had become completely filled with divine clothing
“Excellent! Excellent
Do so, noble son
A dharmabhāṇaka who possesses, recites, and is completely focused on the six-syllable mahāvidyā is rare
“Noble son, in the great city of Vārāṇasī there is a dharmabhāṇaka who possesses, recites, and is completely focused on the six-syllable mahāvidyā.
“The deva said to the brahmin
‘Great brahmin, I have nothing at all.
If you are a human you don’t seem to be one.
“Oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ
“Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gave the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama
I will liberate many millions of trillions of beings from saṃsāra so that they will quickly attain complete buddhahood with the highest complete enlightenment.
‘Noble son, give the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to me
’“Then the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
and the ācārya should teach the nature of the mantras and gestures.
“Then the ācārya should imagine the maṇḍala in his mind
“ ‘ “Noble son, what if, because he has gone to another land and lacks the facilities, he cannot even obtain those?” “ 
“ ‘ “Bhagavat, he should use powder dyed with various colors and use various flowers and various incenses.
“Noble son, what if the noble son or noble daughter is poor and cannot use precious sapphire jewel powder, emerald powder, or gold or silver powder?
“ ‘Then the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Amitābha said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
It should not be given to tīrthikas.
It should be bestowed upon those who aspire for it with faith
or bestowed upon those who aspire for it with faith in the Mahāyāna
They will also quickly attain the highest complete enlightenment, which is complete buddhahood
“ ‘ “The ācārya should not give it to those who are inappropriate
“Noble son, those who write out this six-syllable mahāvidyā are writing out the collection of eighty-four thousand Dharmas
Bhagavat, I am not satisfied by simply hearing about the six-syllable mahāvidyā
Bhagavat, just like those who are not satisfied by just a taste of amṛta
Bhagavat, just like those who are not satisfied by just a taste of amṛta
“Bhagavat, how can I obtain the six-syllable mahāvidyā of perfect yoga
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
“Noble son, in the past, that is what I heard from the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama.
“Then the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama, having received the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, went to the realm named Padmottama
who then offered them back to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama
The four great oceans shook
“When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gave the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to the tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama, everywhere from the four continents to the deva realms shook like plantain leaves
‘Only Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has this kind of power , no other deity.
’“Among them there was one being who was many hundreds of thousands of years old. He was aged, old, feeble, hunchbacked, and bent like a cow’s ear. He said to them
Seated, they asked each other, ‘What deity manifested all of this
“Those beings in the land of Magadha were amazed, and they all sat down together
Whatever those beings wished for, their wishes were fulfilled each time
Then there fell sesame, rice, jujubes, and wild rice
When they were completely satisfied by eating the food, a rain of grain fell
Then there came a rain of divine food with supreme flavors, and they were completely filled
First there was a rain of water, and the water brought them satisfaction
’“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then caused divine rains to fall
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara wondered, ‘By what method can I bring contentment to these beings
When he arrived in the land of Magadha, he saw beings that had lived for twenty years in the wilderness eating each other’s flesh
“Those gathered there asked him, ‘What are the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara?
“While Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the sky he thought, ‘It has been a long time since I’ve seen Tathāgata Viśvabhū,’ and so he next went to Jetavana Monastery
Bhagavat Viśvabhū saw him coming
“As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approached the Jetavana monastery
he saw devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, and a gathering of many hundreds of bodhisattvas
‘This is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who is arriving.
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to Bhagavat Viśvabhū’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and sat on his left
“Bodhisattva Gaganagañja now came to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and sat before him
There is no such field of activity among the tathāgatas, let alone among the bodhisattvas.
“Bhagavat Viśvabhū then began to teach upon the six perfections: “ ‘Noble sons, listen
Having become a bodhisattva, you must complete the perfection of generosity
“Having taught that Dharma he became silent
“The assembled beings each returned to their own dwelling places
and the bodhisattvas returned to their own buddha realms.
This completes part one of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
“Bhagavat, I request that you teach what samādhis Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has previously remained in.
The Bhagavat said
the samādhi named Sunlight
the samādhi named Dispersal
the samādhi named Dispersal
the samādhi named Supreme Vajra Victory Banner
the samādhi named King of Arrays
the samādhi named Seeing the Ten Directions
the samādhi named The Supreme Illumination of the Wish-fulfilling Jewel
the samādhi named Totally Stable
the samādhi named Giving Joy
the samādhi named Vajra Victory Banner
the samādhi named Viewing All Worlds
the samādhi named Completely Present
“Tathāgata Padmottama extended his arm like an elephant extending its trunk and offered a hundred thousand precious strings of pearls to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
who accepted them and offered them to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Amitābha
the samādhi named Truly Bowing Down
the samādhi named Coiled at the Crown
the samādhi named Supreme Illumination by the Moon
the samādhi named Many Attendants
I too obtained skillfulness in methods through the six-syllable mahāvidyā
the samādhi named King’s Power
the samādhi named Supreme Lotus
the samādhi named Manifesting Miracles
the samādhi named Lamp of the Eon
the samādhi named Extinguishing Avīci
the samādhi named Blazing
the samādhi named Divine Bright Earrings
the samādhi named Divine Circle
the samādhi named Drop of Amṛta
the samādhi named Circle of Light
the samādhi named Immersion in the Ocean
the samādhi named Door of the Celestial Palace
the samādhi named Cuckoo’s Song
the samādhi named Scent of the Blue Lotus
the samādhi named Mounted
the samādhi named Vajra Armor
the samādhi named Elephant’s Delight
the samādhi named Lion’s Play
the samādhi named Unsurpassable
the samādhi named Subduing
the samādhi named Moon on High
“ ‘Then the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Amitābha said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara with a voice as beautiful as a cuckoo’s song
Be armor for the complete stability of the mind.
Be infinite teachings for those thirsty for the Dharma
Be like a great sal tree for a great crossroad
Be a parasol for those burned by the sun
Be the path for those who have lost the path
Be the eyes for those whose faculties are poor
I have attended to many millions of trillions of tathāgatas, but I have not obtained the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās
While they are walking, they contemplate with sadness the sufferings of saṃsāra
I have gone to many worlds in search of the six-syllable mahāvidyā, Bhagavat, just like a thirsty person seeks water
“The kiṃnaras take walks along these walkways
bared one shoulder
and kneeling on his right kne
I do desire it, Sugata
How would one know the lord-of-all-kings hand gesture
the samādhi named Beautiful Appearance
How would one know the correct maṇḍala
It should be square with a circumference of five cubits
the samādhi named Summoning the Asuras
“ ‘ “Draw Amitābha in the center of the maṇḍala
the samādhi named Meditation
the samādhi named Summoning Nirvāṇa
They will then all be freed from every human sufferin
“ ‘ “A noble son or noble daughter who wishes to enter that maṇḍala should write the names of the entire lineage of his or her family and first of all cast those names into the maṇḍala
“ ‘ “Place vases filled with various precious jewels at the four corners of the maṇḍala
the samādhi named Liberation of Sensation
Draw them holding their individual offerings
“ ‘ “Draw the four mahārājas at the four doors of the maṇḍala
Draw him holding a smoking stick of incense in his right hand and a basket filled with various adornments in his left hand
“ ‘ “Draw a vidyādhara beneath the legs of Ṣaḍakṣarī Mahāvidyā
Portray the palms of two hands being placed together in the gesture named the lord-of-all-kings
Draw a jewel rosary in her left hand
Draw a jewel upon that lotus
She is adorned with various adornments and holds a lotus in her left hand
the samādhi named Gaping Lion
who has four arms and is white like the autumn moon
On his left draw Ṣaḍakṣarī Mahāvidyā
“ ‘ “On his right create Bodhisattva Mahāmaṇidhara
the samādhi named Lightning
and will become bodhisattvas in their last life
the samādhi named Teaching Ultimate Truth
the samādhi named Creating Union
the samādhi named Approaching
the samādhi named Increasing Power of Mindfulness
Day and night they flow into the ocean
Noble son, this is how the accumulation of merit increases as the result of a single repetition of the six-syllable mahāvidyā
the samādhi named Carriage of Victory
and the samādhi named Teaching the Path
“Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has those samādhis
In each of his pores there are a hundred thousand samādhis
Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara thus has an incalculable accumulation of merit
Even the tathāgatas do not have that kind of accumulation of merit, let alone a bodhisattva
“Noble son, in the past, when I was a bodhisattva named Siṃhalarāja, I was going to the island of Siṃhala with five hundred merchants
I asked the pilot, ‘Toward what lands are the winds blowing
Are the winds blowing toward Ratnadvīpa, or are the winds blowing toward Yavanadvīpa, or are the winds blowing toward the island of the rākṣasīs?
“The pilot answered
‘Know this, lord: the breeze is blowing toward Siṃhala Island.
“Five hundred rākṣasīs took on the form of maidens
and with a great cry came down to the shore
They gave us cotton robes
We put them on, wrung our clothes dry
We were going to Siṃhala Island bringing much merchandise in chariots, in bags, baskets, and pots, carried by camels, oxen, donkeys, and so on, so as to go to villages, towns, suburbs, cities, and markets. “I found an excellent ship that had been to Siṃhala Island many times
the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once would be far greater than the accumulation of merit of those bodhisattvas
and went to sit under a large magnolia tree
“ ‘Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, if for a year of twelve months
Seated, we talked among ourselves, asking each other what we should do
but we agreed that there was nothing we could do, and we became silent
which completes the taste of the Dharma
“The rākṣasīs came to us and said, ‘You who are not masters of a house, become masters
You who have no refuge, obtain a refuge
You who have no home, obtain a home
These will be your bathing pools for you to enjoy.
“After the rākṣasīs had spoken to us thus, each one took a merchant home to be the master of her house
The senior rākṣasī took me home to be the master of her house
She satisfied me with food that had perfect, divine flavors
Having satisfied me with food, she frolicked with me
and in this way I was perfectly satisfied with human pleasures. Two or three weeks passed in that manner
and facing Bhagavat Śikhin, placed his palms together and addressed these words to him
“One night as I was lying in bed, I was astonished to see that the lamp was laughing
I asked it, ‘Why are you laughing?
I had never seen or heard before of a burning, laughing lamp
“It answered, ‘This is one of the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island
“From within that assembly Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi arose from his seat
They shone on all worlds in the ten directions, then returned and entered the mouth of the bhagavat
“It answered, ‘If you don’t believe me, take the road south and follow it
You will come to a high fortress without windows or doorways
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
“What were the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara that you heard the tathāgata describe
“At that time, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, I was Bodhisattva Dānaśūra
and I heard from him the description of the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara.
Many hundreds of merchants have been thrown in there. Some are alive
Some are dead
If you don’t believe me, follow that road
Follow that road and observe
“Noble son, those are the words I heard Tathāgata Vipaśyin say
They will say to ordinary beings
“ ‘It is said: the sky is his liṅga
Then you will believe me.
The earth is his seat
He is the foundation of all beings
The liṅga is so called because they dissolve into it.
“So I made the rākṣasī enter the sleep named Ignorance’s Net, and I went out at night, armed with a sword that glowed like moonlight
‘Maheśvara, in the kaliyuga, when beings have bad natures, you will be declared to be the primal deity who is the creator, the maker
All those beings will be excluded from the path to enlightenment
“Bhagavat, if I cannot find a birch bark page to write it on, nor ink, nor a reed pen
I will make ink from my blood
“At that time, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, I was a merchant named Sugandhamukha
I will slice off my skin to make a page
and I heard Tathāgata Vipaśyin describe the qualities of Avalokiteśvara.
and I will break one of my bones to make a pen
I took the road that led south, and followed it until eventually I came to an iron fortress
I walked around it, but could not find a door
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
“What were the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara that you heard the tathāgata describe?
However, there was a magnolia tree beside the iron fortress, and so I climbed up it
“Āditya and Candra came from his eyes
Maheśvara came from his forehead
Brahmā came from his shoulders
Nārāyaṇa came from his heart
Devi Sarasvatī came from his canines
Vāyu came from his mouth
Dharaṇī came from his feet
and Varuṇa came from his stomach
The Bhagavat told Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin
“Noble son, I remember going to as many worlds as there are atoms in the world for the sake of obtaining this six-syllable mahāvidyā
I honored many millions of trillions of tathāgatas, but I did not obtain it, and I did not hear it from those tathāgatas
“Noble son, I went to Tathāgata Padmottama
Noble son, go to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama. He knows this six-syllable mahāvidyā.
The Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Ratnottama said, ‘Noble son, don’t weep so pitifully
I approached the realm of Tathāgata Padmottama, arrived there 
and bowed my head to the feet of Tathāgata Padmottama
I seek to obtain that which is difficult for a bodhisattva to obtain
For that purpose I have been to many worlds, in distress. I have arrived here, exhausted and without any result.
When we were outside the town and had sat down
“Some said, ‘She is very loving toward me.
“Some said, ‘She takes care of me with food that has perfect, divine flavors.
Noble son, not even the tathāgatas have Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s prowess.
“Some said, ‘She provides me with all kinds of clothes.
“Some said, ‘She gives me diadems, earrings, and necklaces.
“Some said, ‘I don’t have to do any physical work.
“Some said, ‘She cares for me with sandalwood, musk, and camphor.
and five hundred yojanas wide
“Bhagavat, did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leave?
Then Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
and completely fills it with sesame seeds. There isn’t even a needle-sized hole in this building
shakes his body, and then asks three times, “Who is going to cross over to the far shore? Who is going to cross over to the far shore? Who is going to cross over to the far shore?
At its door there is an immortal man who never ages
We should go to him.
If every hundred eons that man takes out one sesame seed
“The merchants asked me, ‘On what day should we go?
I can calculate the time when such a building would be emptied down to the floor
“I answered, ‘We should definitely leave in three days’ time
He eats the herb called sarvaśetāna, rolls back and forth on the golden sand
’“At that time there appeared the sound of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
“I told them, ‘On Siṃhala Island there is Bālāha, the king of horses, who has compassion for the desolate and destitute
Do you have a plan for us?
“The merchants asked me, ‘What can we do
they are not humans. They are rākṣasīs.
those who have seen the activities of a bodhisattva are good beings
those who have seen the activities of a pratyekabuddha are good beings
“I answered, ‘It is true, indeed it is true. By the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha
Those who have seen the activities of a tathāgata are good beings
Those who are dedicated to the sacred representations and the dharmabhāṇakas are good beings
“They were disturbed by my words, and asked, ‘Great head merchant, is it true that they are the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island?
Those who repair dilapidated, ruined, ancient stūpas are good beings
“After the merchants told me these things, I said to them, ‘It is not right for us to be attached to rākṣasīs in this way.
Those who repair dilapidated and ruined monasteries are good beings
Those who beat the dharmagaṇḍī are good beings
Those who follow the eightfold path are good beings
Those who continuously learn the Mahāyāna are good contemplative beings
“The rākṣasī asked me, ‘Are you tired
Are you weary
Happy are those good humans who always rely on a kalyāṇamitra
Happy are those humans in Jambudvīpa who are always supporting their parents and honoring them
“I answered, ‘I haven’t seen any.’
The rākṣasī then said
and the nāga kings sent rain at the appropriate times; and those grains grew, ripened, and were harvested; if Jambudvīpa were made into one threshing floor
‘Noble son, in this Siṃhala Island there are pleasing gardens of all kinds that are completely filled with flowers, and there are many hundreds of bathing pools.
“I said, ‘I will go to those gardens and the various flower-filled pools in three days’ time
When the pretas tasted the water, their throats widened, their bodies became whole
and the grain was brought in carts, in animal loads, in bundles and baskets, and put on that threshing floor, trodden by oxen and donkeys, and made into one big heap
and they were completely satisfied by the supreme flavor of divine food
“Then they contemplated human existence. They thought about saṃsāric existence in this way
‘Oh! The humans in Jambudvīpa are happy. They can perfectly enjoy cool shade
“Those gandharva maidens remember the name of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. Whenever in the three periods they remember it, all valuable things appear for them.
and he emitted great rivers from all his pores
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s mind was filled with compassion on seeing these beings
he emitted ten rivers from his ten toes
and he emitted ten rivers from his ten fingers
He is a parasol for those burned and pained by the sun
He is a river for those afflicted with thirst
He gives freedom from fear to those who are terrified and afraid
He is medicine for those afflicted with sickness
He is a father and mother for beings who suffer
The staff-wielding guard at the gates, who had thick calves and red eyes, became kind and said, ‘I should not be performing this duty.
He is a teacher of nirvāṇa to those reborn in Avīci
Those are his special qualities
“ ‘Those who remember his name will have happiness in this world and will completely leave behind every suffering in saṃsāra
“As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived at the city of the pretas, it coole
and the vajra hail ceased
The Bhagavat replied
they were like standing skeletons
they were covered with hair
they had stomachs the size of mountains an
“Bhagavat, did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leave?
The seven jewels are: the precious wheel, the precious horse, the precious elephant, the precious jewel, the precious wife, the precious householder, and the precious counselor. 
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
who creates the lamp of Dharma
whose perfectly supreme form is whatever form is pleasing
For we who have no support, be a support
For we who have no protector, be a protector
For we who have no husband, be a husband
For we who have no husband, be a husband
who has the form of a gandharva
who has a form like a mountain of gold
who is deep like the vast ocean
who has attained the ultimate yoga
who shows his own face
‘Sir, take us young women. We have no husband
who has many hundreds of thousands of samādhis
who brings true pleasure
Desiring him, they came to him and said
When they saw his handsome body they desired him
Arriving there, he transformed himself into a handsome form and approached the rākṣasīs
’“In that way, Yamarāja praised Avalokiteśvara with a particularly sacred praise
Then Yamarāja circumambulated him three times and departed.
who has paths to enlightenment accumulated within his body
who completely liberates pretas
“The great brahmin descended from the deva realms to the island of Siṃhala
who accumulates various paths to enlightenment; who has entered sacred liberation
“After the deva had recited this verse, the brahmin departed
who is the lord of knowledge; who brings freedom from all afflictions
On this day the seed has been planted, And on this day the fruit has been produced.
“ ‘Oh, the one who is comprised of qualities Is devoid of all evi
I am one who has compassion for the poor and the wretched. I am one who shows them the path to enlightenment
I am a bodhisattva.’“Deva Sukuṇḍala then offered his diadem and earrings to the brahmin and recited
who terrifies the three worlds
who frightens yakṣas, rākṣasas, bhūtas, pretas, and piśācas, vetālas, ḍākinīs, kūṣmāṇḍas, and apasmāras
who reveals the beneficial lasso; who has hundreds of mantras; who terrifies Vajrapāṇi
and some attained the result of becoming a non-returner
who has a sacred thread made of the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda
who liberates beings from illness
The rākṣasīs were no longer afflicted by the suffering of desire, there was no anger in their minds
they did not wish to cause anyone’s death
We will nourish ourselves in the same way that humans do in Jambudvīpa: with food and drink
who is a parasol for beings
From now on we will not act like rākṣasīs, and we will keep the upāsikā vows.’ In this way the rākṣasīs took vows
who brings the city of the pretas to an end
who teaches the path to nirvāṇa
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then left the island of Siṃhal
who is a precious wish-fulfilling jewel
and went to a place where many hundreds of thousands of different kinds of insects lived within a cesspit in the great city of Vārāṇasī
who is free from all existences
who has many retinues; who creates abundance
the pot burst open
‘Do not be afraid, noble son, do not be afraid
and the inferno of fire was transformed into a pool.
It has been a long time since you were here in Tamondhakāra.
“He answers
“When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Intimidating Lion, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Play of the Lion
who illuminates like the sun
who teaches the six perfections
who brings freedom from fear
who delights in wisdom
who extinguishes Avīci
who is adorned by the splendor of wisdom
who brings joy
“After Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara had ripened those beings
he left the great city of Vārāṇasī. “Next he went to Magadha
and they were then all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas named Sugandhamukha
the samādhi named Hundred Light Rays
the samādhi named Brightening
the samādhi named Shining
the samādhi named Sprinkling
‘Noble son, why is your body cold?’“I answered, ‘I went outside the town to defecate and urinate
rolls back and forth on the golden san
Bālāha, the king of horses, eats the herb named sarvaśetāna
There is a divine king of horses named Bālāha who has compassion for the desolate and destitute
“It said
“The lamp said
‘Lord, I have a way by which you can comfortably and happily leave Siṃhala Island and see Jambudvīpa once more.
I said to her, ‘The people of Jambudvīpa and my homeland are so pleasant.
In this Siṃhala Island you have a home with food, a home with drink, a home with clothes
a variety of delightful gardens, and a variety of delightful bathing pools. Enjoy these divine pleasures
“That day passed, and on the second day, my provisions of good food were quickly prepared
Everyone had made his preparations, and at dawn on the third day we all left the city, coming out through its gate
When we were outside, we agreed that not one of us would turn to look back at Siṃhala Island
After we had made that agreement, we hurried as quickly as we could
and eventually reached the location of Bālāha, the king of horses
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra spent twelve years wandering in search of those pores, but he never saw them
He did not even see the hundred buddhas who live in each of those pores, let alone any bodhisattvas.
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat

who is a splendor of jewels
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvaśūra
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra

‘Why is your place of work completely destroyed?
The Jetavana Monastery appeared completely beautified
“Then Yama’s guardians gathered their swords, clubs, short spears, long spears, maces, discuses, tridents, and so on, and, taking all their Avīci utensils, went to the Dharmarāja Yamarāja
Bhagavat, where did these great light rays come from
At the time of this great gathering, light rays shone in the great Avīci hell
Having shone there, they came to the Jetavana Monastery, where they became adornments for the monastery
buildings with doors made of gold and silver
buildings with steps made of gold and silver
and upper stories made of gold and silver, the silver upper stories having gold pillars adorned with divine jewels and the gold upper stories having silver pillars adorned with divine jewels
In the gardens around Jetavana, there appeared various kinds of wish-fulfilling trees
They had trunks of gold and leaves of silver and were bedecked with a variety of adornments
with beautiful monastic robes, with Kaśika cloth
with hundreds of thousands of pearl necklaces, and with hundreds of thousands of crowns, earrings, braided ribbons, armlets, and anklets
Outside the monastery there appeared hundreds of trees, which, like the wish-fulfilling trees, were made from precious metals and were bedecked with precious bracelets
Within the Jetavana Monastery, there appeared stairs made from diamonds and entrance chambers hung with pearls and silks
Many bathing pools also appeared
Some were completely filled with water that had the eight qualities
Some were completely filled with a variety of flowers
they were completely filled with blue lotuses, red lotuses, night lotuses, white lotuses, tiger claw flowers and great tiger claw flowers, and udumbara flowers
Moreover, there were a variety of tree blossoms
Many hundreds of thousands of upāsakas and upāsikās had gathered there
Many hundreds of thousands of tīrthika mendicant renunciants had also gathered there
and many hundreds of thousands of other female kiṃnaras were gathered there
Vajrāṅkuśa, the king of mountains, is , yojanas wide on each side
On the side of that king of mountains there is an ageless, immortal man, who once every eon wipes the mountain one time with a Kaśika cloth
Even this alone will eventually cause the mountain to be worn down and vanish
They talk with each other about the sūtras, the geyas, the vyākaraṇas, the gāthās, the udānas, the nidānas, the avadānas, the itivṛttakas, the jātakas, the vaipulyas, the adbhūtadharmas, and the upadeśas
Thus have I heard: One time the Bhagavat was staying, with a great saṅgha of , bhikṣus and a multitude of bodhisattvas, at Jetavana, the monastery of Anāthapiṇḍada, in Śrāvastī
The thirty-two classes of devas had also gathered there, the principal ones being Maheśvara and Nārāyaṇa. Śakra, who is the lord of the devas, Brahmā, who is the lord of the Sahā universe, Candra, Āditya, Vāyu, Varuṇa, and other deities were also assembled there

pillars adorned with divine, precious jewels
multistoried buildings that were covered with gold
From within that assembly Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin arose from his seat, bared one shoulder, and kneeling on his right knee an
facing the Bhagavat, placed his palms together an
inquired of the Bhagavat
Bhagavat, I have perceived a great, wonderful marvel
Who has this power
Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara entered the great Avīci hell
When he had completely liberated the beings there, he went to the city of the pretas
Then Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat
Bhagavat, as the great Avīci hell is without respite
how did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter it
In the great Avīci hell a wall encloses a ground made of burning iron
which has become one raging flame in the shape of a reed basket. Within this Avīci hell there is a pot from which comes the sound of wailing. Many hundreds of thousands of tens of millions of hundreds of millions of beings have been thrown into that pot
Just as green or black mung beans are massed together in a water-filled vessel, rising and sinking as they are cooked
that is how the beings in the great Avīci hell undergo physical suffering
just as a cakravartin king enters a grove made of divine jewels
Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara entered the great Avīci hel
it had no effect upon his body. As he approached the Avīci hell, it cooled
Why has an inauspicious sign appeared in this Avīci hell
When they arrived, they told him
Divine One, know first that our place of work is completely destroyed
Divine One, know first that an inauspicious omen appeared in this Avīci hell
There entered a handsome being, with his hair in a topknot, his body beautified by divine adornments
The moment he arrived, lotus flowers the size of cartwheels appeared
Yamarāja wondered
What deity has manifested this power
Is this a special result that has occurred through the blessing of the deity Maheśvara, Nārāyaṇa, or some other deity? Have they descended to this level
Or has a powerful rākṣasa been born who rivals great Rāvaṇa
He looked with his divine sight into the heavens, wondering whose blessing this could be
Then he looked back into the Avīci hel
and saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara there
Yamarāja went to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
who brings relief to turtles, crocodiles, and fish
who creates the greatest mass of wisdom
who is the one to whom all devas make offerings, pay homage, and show reverence
who has a beautified body; who manifests as the supreme rishi
who brings freedom from the terrors of bondage in stocks and manacles
who has eyes like blue lotuses
and who has hundreds of thousands of samādhis as numerous as atoms
Noble son, he left the Avīci hell and went to the city of the pretas
mouths the size of a needle’s eye
Many hundreds of thousands of pretas came running toward him
wisdom, like a thunderbolt, destroyed the view of the aggregates as a self, which is like a mountain with twenty peaks
and the pretas were all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas named Ākāṅkṣitamukha
Avalokiteśvara, having completely liberated those beings, departed from the city of the pretas
Noble son, each day he completely ripens a million trillion beings
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked him
Bhagavat, how is that so
here appeared in this worl
the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Vipaśyin
When those deities had come from Avalokiteśvara’s body
that bhagavat told the deity Maheśvara
In a later time, there appeared in this world the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, the one with wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Śikhin
When all the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and humans had gathered together
the bhagavat Śikhin looked at the great gathering and began to speak of the Dharma within that assembly
At that time, light rays of various colors emanated from the mouth of Bhagavat Śikhin. They were blue, yellow, red, white, orange, and the color of crystal and of silver
the ground appears to be made of gold
Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin
Bhagavat, what are these omens of
and that is why these omens appear
As the earth shook and it rained beautiful lotuses
He bowed down his head to the bhagavat’s feet and offered the lotuses to him. He said, ‘Tathāgata Amitābha sends these flowers to you. The Tathagāta asks if you are in health, if you are at ease, and if all is well.
How did you, Avalokiteśvara, accomplish your tas
among the pretas, the beings in the Avīci hell, the beings in Kālasūtra and Raurava, the beings in Hāhava, Tāpana, the great hell Pretāyana, the great hell Agnighaṭa, the great hell Śālmali, the great hell Śītodaka, and others
The beings in those great hells are my task
I will completely ripen those beings
and then I will bring them to the highest complete enlightenment
If someone were for a deva’s eon to serve tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils
Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, I can count every hair on all the four-legged creatures in the four great continents, such as lions, tigers, bears, hyenas, deer, camels, jackals, and so on, and oxen, donkeys, cattle, elephants, horses, buffalo, and cats
Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, I can count the number of leaves in a forest of agarwood trees, bu
I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, if all the women, men, boys, and girls in the four great continent
were to gain the result of becoming stream entrants, once-returners, non-returners, arhats, and pratyekabuddhas
Noble son, even if all who are tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas like m
were gathered in one place and provided for an eon with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils
those tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas would still not be able to calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
So, noble son, it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in this world
Those who remember Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s name will have happiness in this world
and will remain in that realm until Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s powerful commitment is fulfilled and all beings have been brought to liberation
Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin
He completely ripens the many beings who circle in saṃsāra
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a pratyekabuddha to beings who are to be taught by a pratyekabuddha
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to beings who are to be taught by a yakṣa
He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to beings who are to be taught by Vaiśravaṇa
Noble son, in this Jambudvīpa there is a cave named Vajrakukṣi in which a hundred thousand million times ten million asuras live
At the time of death, twelve tathāgatas will come an
Noble son, do not be afraid
You have heard the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
You have prepared various parasols, various crowns, various earrings, and various necklaces
When that kind of omen appears, at death they will go without impediment to Sukhāvatī
When the asura king Bali saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approaching from the distance
he went toward Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, accompanied by his queens, his retinue, and many asuras such as Kubja and Vāmanaka with their retinues. Bali bowed down at his feet and said these words
Bali offered a bejeweled throne to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara an
Bhagavat, look with compassion upon those who like to perform bad actions, who lust after the wives of others, who are dedicated to killing, who kill others, and who are old and dying
You, lord, be our father and mother and show the path to we who are bound in bondage
I will explain how much merit is acquired by those who give alms to a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyaksaṃbuddha
As a comparison, were there to be as many bodhisattvas like myself as there are grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers
As a comparison, I can count how many atoms there are, but
noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving
As a comparison, if all the men, women, boys, and girls in the four continents were to apply themselves to work
As a comparison, I can count each drop in the vast extent of the ocean, but
and then if the men, women, boys, and girls were to load that mustard into carts, bags, and baskets, onto camels, donkeys, and cattle, an
collect the great harvest together; an
then if the donkeys and cattle threshed it to make a vast heap of mustard seeds
Noble son, it is like this
As a comparison, the lower half of the supreme mountain Sumeru extends downward for , yojana
if the vast ocean was to become an inkwell
and if all the men, women, boys, and girls who live in the four continents were to become scribes
and if they were to write on the limitless, endless extent of Mount Sumeru as birch bark, I would be able to count each letter
As a comparison, if all those scribes were to become bodhisattvas on the tenth bhūmi
then the accumulation of merit of all those bodhisattvas on the tenth bhūmi would then equal the accumulation of merit through that alms giving
As a comparison, I can count each grain of sand in the ocean
but I made my offerings not knowing that, and made an offering to a petitioner who came to me in the form of a dwarf
I had prepared offerings of elephant- and horse-drawn carts carrying diadems, earrings, and necklaces
hung with precious yak-tail whisks, and covered with strings of pearls, a net of pearls as a rear adornment
and jingling golden bells hanging from silver cords
I had also prepared offerings of a thousand tawny cows with silver hooves, golden horns, and covered with nets of pearls
wearing diadems, earrings, and necklaces
adorned with armlets, bracelets, anklets, and girdles
and wearing rings, sash necklaces, and gold rings on the big toes of their left feet
They jingled as they moved, and wore clothing of silks in a variety of colors
I had also prepared a hundred thousand precious seats, numerous heaps of gold, heaps of silver, and heaps of jewels
Are you alive or dead
and one day in the form of a man
Daśaratha­putra, seizing the opportunity, quickly removed the seven mountains, throwing them to another place
He then shouted loudly to the kṣatriyas
the other kings heard him and were relieved and comforted
Then the great hero destroyed all the doors and looked inside the copper cave
All the bound kings saw Nārāyaṇa
They discussed among each other, saying, “Either the time has come for the asura king Bali to die, or the time has come for us to be slain.
It is good if we die in battle, but it’s not good to die in chains
They said to each other
Daśaratha­putra transformed himself into a dwarf who wore a deerskin as a sash, held a bamboo staff, and carried a stool
He came to where I was and arrived at my door
Your Majesty, a brahmin dwarf has arrived here
Your Majesty, I don’t know
Go and bring the brahmin to me
The guard summoned him, saying, “Come in, great brahmin.
Then he came inside and was placed on a precious seat
Bhagavat, how do you know that
I know by seeing his signs and omens
Then Nārāyaṇa appeared in his own form. He was vast, with the sun and moon on his shoulders
and holding a sword, a bow, a wheel, a long spear, and a short spear in his hands
Nārāyaṇa took two steps and said, “Give me my third step!
I said, “There can be no third
Wherever I place you, there shall you stay
Is this true? Is this true
It’s the truth, it’s the truth
Thus Nārāyaṇa caught me in the noose of truth
The offering site was destroyed and the offering bowls discarded
Homage to you, lord
Then Nārāyaṇa took me, my queens, and my retinue and placed us in the underworld
In the past I made that gift to a bad recipient
the one who wears a matted topknot
the one who has beautiful eyes like parasols
to the one who is a teacher of the six perfections; and to the one whose thoughts are good
I make this prais
The beings who remember your name, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, will have happiness
You, lord of the asuras, will become the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Śrī
As a gift with which to request the Dharma, Bali presented Avalokiteśvara with strings of pearls worth a hundred thousand silver coins and diadems adorned with various jewels
Human beings are continually thinking about transitory things, about acquisitions, about great pleasures, about male and female slaves, servants, and hired workers, about costly clothes, beds, and seats, about valuable treasures, riches, stores of grain, and storerooms, about sons and daughters, and about wives and parents
They are ignorant
Those things that they are attached to appear as dreams do
They will see the great trees that blaze with fire, blaze strongly, and blaze fiercely
When they see them they will be terrified
bind them with nooses and drag them away
Numerous ravens, vultures, eagles, and dogs will devour them
They will experience the sensation of great suffering in the hells
When they step off the great road of razors, five hundred thorns, each with sixteen spikes, will pierce each foot
They will cry out, “What have I, who delighted in bad actions, done?
Yama’s servants will reply
Friend, you did not offer alms to the Tathāgata
You did not hear the gaṇḍī being beaten
To that they will reply
You did not circumambulate a stūpa anywhere
We were without faith, delighted in bad actions, rejected the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha
and are experiencing the result of those actions
Yama’s guardians will then take them to King Yama
bring them before him, and present them to him
King Yama will sa
Show them today your place of work
So Yama’s guardians will bring them to the great Kālasūtra hell and put them into it
Inside there, though a hundred spears strike them, they will not die
Though a hundred spears strike them a second time, they will not die
Though a hundred spears strike them a third time, they still will not die
Because they will not die, they are thrown into a furnace
but there they still will not die
A red hot metal ball will be inserted into their mouths
incinerating their lips, destroying their teeth
splitting their palate
and loudly burning up their throat, gullet, heart, anus, and whole body
It is like this, great king. There will be no one to protect them in that other world
great king, you must diligently create merit in this life
Bhagavat, where did these light rays come from
Noble son, the light rays came from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who is in the palace of Bali, the lord of the asuras
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja then asked Bhagavat Viśvabhū
Is there a way for me to see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara left the palace of Bali, lord of the asuras
divine flowers fell on Jetavana Monastery
and extremely beautiful wish-granting trees appeared there. They were hung with hundreds of thousands of adornments
They become happy as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrives there, and with joy in their heart
they run to him. When they come to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, they pay homage at his feet and ask
You are not tired? You are not exhausted
Those who hear and then possess, study, promulgate, and have their minds completely focused on even one four-line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
will be inspired to accumulate merit
Noble sons, it is like this
For example, I can count the drops in the vast ocean, but
if tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers were gathered together in one place an
for twelve eons were provided with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils, they would still not be able to calculate the merit that comes from even one four-line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display. So it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in Tamondhakāra
the accumulation of merit from one four-line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, would be far greater than the merit from inserting the relics
For example, even if all the households in the four continents built monasteries of gold and jewels and built a thousand stūpas inside each of those monasteries, and in one day inserted relics in them all
For example, just as the five great rivers flow into the great ocean
Those who always possess and remember the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
will be completely liberated from the suffering of saṃsāra and be completely liberated from birth, aging, sickness, death, misery, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and conflict
and they will have immense, powerful strength
But Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to them
I have to bring many beings onto the path to enlightenment
Avalokiteśvara came to that deva in the form of the brahmin and said to him
‘I’m hungry and thirsty.
You should give me what little you have
Sukuṇḍala thought, ‘Without a doubt the one at my door is an excellent recipient for offerings, and he has brought me this attainment of splendor.
Sukuṇḍala invited the brahmin into his divine palace. The brahmin entered, an
Sukuṇḍala offered him the divine jewels
served him the food with divine perfect flavors, an
The brahmin ate and recited a benediction
Great brahmin, where do you come from
I come from the monastery named Jetavana
What is that place like
The deva Sukuṇḍala then asked him
Son of a deva, that is how pleasant that place is
I am not a deva and I am not a human
These are your homes with food; homes with drink; and homes with clothes and a variety of multicolored beds, beautiful gardens, and beautiful pools
Only if you do as I command
We will
He then taught them the noble eightfold path
He made them recite the fourfold scriptures
Some of them attained the result of becoming a once-returner
they continually delighted in the Dharma, and they took vows
They promised, ‘We shall kill no more
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived there, he transformed himself into the form of a bee that made a buzzing sound that was heard by the insects as the words
‘Namo buddhāya, namo dharmāya, namaḥ saṃghāya.’ The insects remembered the words namo buddhāya, namo dharmāya, namaḥ saṃghāya, and the thunderbolt of wisdom destroyed the mountain, which has twenty peaks, that is the view of the aggregates as a self
The man began to describe Avalokiteśvara’s qualities to them
He is a lamp for those in darkness
Those who continually gather and offer flowers and incense to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvar
will become cakravartin kings who possess the seven jewels
Those who offer flowers to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have aromatic bodies, an
wherever they are reborn, their bodies will be perfect
The old man taught Avalokiteśvara’s special qualities in that way
Then those gathered there returned to their homes
and the aged man, having taught them an appropriate Dharma, returned to his home
and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara vanished into the sky
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asked Bhagavat Viśvabhū
Bhagavat, which bodhisattva is arriving
Are you tired? Are you weary? Noble son, what work have you been doing
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja was extremely amaze
I have never seen such a field of activity as that of this bodhisattva
Seated, he asked Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
Are you tired? Are you weary
I am not tired and I am not weary
They talked with each other and then became silent
Similarly, you must complete the perfection of conduct, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, the perfection of meditation, and the perfection of wisdom
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin then said to the Bhagavat
the samādhi named Creation
the samādhi named Illumination
the samādhi named Sublime Vajra
he samādhi named Armlet
the samādhi named Ornament
the samādhi named Aspiration
So we set sail in the great ship in the direction of Siṃhala Island
but the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island sent untimely wind
that broke the great ship into pieces. We fell into the water an
swam to the shore
These will be your homes supplied with food. These will be your homes supplied with drink. These will be your gardens for you to enjoy
She is going to kill you
I asked it, ‘How do you know she is a rākṣasī?
I made the sound of spitting, an
the merchants inside heard me, “They said, ‘Great head merchant, know this! We have been thrown into this iron fortress. Each day a hundred men are taken and eaten
When they have been eaten, their bones are scattered around the iron fortress
That is how they described what had happened to them. I climbed down the magnolia tree an
went quickly back up the southern road
When I returned to the house, the lamp asked me, ‘Head merchant, did you see?
I answered, ‘I saw,
and then asked it, ‘What can I do?
shakes his body
and then asks, “Who is going to cross over to the far shore?
You should then say, “Lord, I am going to cross over to the far shore.
Once the lamp had told me this, I went to lie down next to the rākṣasī. She awoke and asked me
That’s why my body has become cold
And so she went back to sleep
At sunrise I got u
and said to all the merchants, ‘Come with m
We are going outside the town
I asked them, ‘How affectionate are your wives toward you
Each person should prepare provisions for the journey
They promised they would and returned to town, each to their own home
Have you seen the delightful gardens and the delightful bathing pools
I will gather beautiful flowers there and then return. Therefore you should prepare good traveling provisions for me
She said, ‘Noble son, I will do so.
I contemplated my predicament, thinking, ‘These rākṣasīs will kill us if they find out.
I remained silent, contemplating this predicament
The rākṣasī served me good food, and as I ate it, I sighed
The rākṣasī asked me, ‘Noble son, why did you sigh?
Noble son, what would you do in your homeland
Why be sorrowful in Jambudvīpa
I said nothing in reply
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was Bālāha, the king of horses, and he rescued me from the fear of death
I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit, bu
I can say just a little about his pores
A trillion gandharvas dwell in a pore named Suvarṇa
They perceive divine objects but are free from attachment
They have no aversion, they do not become angry
and they never have malice
in this pore named Suvarṇa there is a wish-fulfilling jewel named Avabhāsa
Those rishis have leaf huts where there are wish-fulfilling trees with red trunks and gold and silver leaves that shine like jewels
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, it is like this
There are four pools near each wish-fulfilling tree
They see birth, aging, and death
They see separation from the desired and beloved, and encounters with the disliked
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat
Bhagavat, I am utterly astonished
Bhagavat, if those kinds of things appear just because someone thinks of the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display
then those who listen to, cause to be written out, possess, recite, study, and have their minds completely focused on the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, will have happiness
Those who write a single letter from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, will have happiness an
will not see these sufferings of saṃsāra
The Bhagavat gave his approval, saying, “That is excellent
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin. Your eloquence and your teaching of this kind of Dharma to a gathering of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, upāsakas, and upāsikās is excellent! Excellent
Then Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat
Bhagavat, when you teach what I request, the devas gain unwavering faith
are beautiful and attractive
have magnificent, fair complexions
their bodies are adorned with divine jewelry
and they rival the apsarases
Even though they have this beauty, they are not afflicted by the suffering of desire
Bhagavat, if Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra did not see the
why should I go
as being a great yogin, a sublime yogin
as being with form, a vast form, a hundred thousand arms, a trillion eyes, and eleven heads
Bhagavat, how can I see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
Noble son, you will see him if he comes here, to the Sahā universe, to look at me, bow down to me, and honor me
I request it, Bhagavat, that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara may come
Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara first comes when a being is ripened
What point is there in my having a long life that is devoted to bad actions, deprived of the sight of Avalokiteśvara, blind, and following a path of darkness
Bhagavat, when is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara coming
The Bhagavat laughed and said, “Noble son, it is not yet time for Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara to come
Beyond that pore, there is a pore named Amṛtabindu. In that pore a million trillion devas live
and some are on the tenth bodhisattva bhūmi
Within that pore named Amṛtabindu there are sixty mountains of gold and silver
who are continuously playing music
Within that pore named Amṛtabindu there are many millions of trillions of extremely beautiful celestial palaces completely adorned with divine jewels
some are completely filled with flowers, and some are completely filled with blue lotuses, red lotuses, night lotuses, white lotuses, fragrant water lilies, tiger claw flowers, and great tiger claw flowers
are hung with diadems, earrings, garlands, one hundred and eight-string and sixty-four-string necklaces
and are perfectly hung with armlets and a variety of other adornments
Beyond that pore, there is a pore named Vajramukha. Within it live many hundreds of thousands of kiṃnara
beautified by necklaces, earrings, garlands, various jewelry, and ointments
There are many hundreds of mountains within that pore
Some are made of diamonds
The kiṃnaras relax in those celestial palace
they each go to walk in their own walkways
hung with diadems, earrings, and garlands
hung with anklets
hung with one hundred and eight-string and sixty-four-string necklaces
and hung with strings of jewels
These wish-fulfilling trees around the walkways are like many-storied mansions
The kiṃnaras contemplate in that way
and following that contemplation they contemplate the essence of nirvāṇa
Bhagavat, where can the six-syllable mahāvidyā be obtained
Noble son, even the tathāgatas do not know the six-syllable mahāvidyā, let alone the bodhisattvas
Bhagavat, do the tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas not know it
Noble son, the six-syllable mahāvidyā is the supreme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
Bhagavat, are there any beings who know the six-syllable vidyāmantra
Noble son, no one knows the six-syllable mahāvidyā
Residing there they give their approval, saying, ‘Excellent, excellent, noble son! You have acquired such a wish-fulfilling jewel as this. Seven generations of your descendants will attain liberation. Noble son, even all the beings who live in your stomach will become irreversible bodhisattvas
will be known to be a stūpa containing relics
and will be known to be the wisdom of ten million tathāgatas
Women, men, boys, and girls who just see that person
which is the inconceivable yoga and the immeasurable and highest dhyāna
which shows the way to the nirvāṇa of supreme enlightenment
which is the entranceway into liberation
and which is the imperishable teaching of omniscience
Bhagavat, how can I obtain it
would offer the four continents filled with the seven precious materials to anyone who bestows upon me the six-syllable mahāvidyā
Bhagavat, I have no concern for my body. The one who bestows it upon me will be my parents, my guru of gurus
At that time I went, weeping, to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, the one with wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Ratnottama
I placed my palms together before hi
this six-syllable mahāvidyā, which purifies all bad karma merely by the remembrance of its name
Then Tathāgata Padmottama praised the qualities of this six-syllable mahāvidyā
As a comparison, I can know the number of atoms, but
noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once
Noble son, it is like this. As a comparison, I can count the grains of sand in the ocean, but
As a comparison, a person builds a building that is a hundred yojanas hig
but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once
As a comparison, if the people in the four continents were all to work at various kinds of agriculture, such as barley, wheat, rice, green or black mung beans, and so on; and jujubes, horse gram, and so on
then, noble son, I could count every single grain
As a comparison, in Jambudvīpa there are great rivers that flow day and night
They are the Sītā, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Indus, the Pakṣu, the Sutlej, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Sumāgandha, the Himavatī, and the Godavari
Each of these rivers has five hundred tributaries
I can count each drop in those great rivers, but
noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once
As a comparison, I can count each hair on all four-legged beings such as herds of oxen, donkeys, buffaloes, horses, and elephants; dogs, jackals, goats, and similarly lions, tigers, wolves, deer, monkeys, hares, pigs, and so on; and rats and cats, and so on; but
As a comparison, the king of mountains, named Vajrāṅkuśa, is , yojanas high and extends downward into the sea for , yojanas
Noble son, it is like this
the ocean is , yojanas deep, and it has an immeasurable expanse, extending as far as Vaḍavāmukha. I can count all its drops of water, which are the size of the tip of a hair, but
As a comparison, I can count the number of leaves in a forest of agarwood trees, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once
As a comparison, even if all the men, women, boys, and girls who live in the four continents were to be on the seventh bodhisattva bhūmi
or with a leap-month to make a year of thirteen months, it were to rain day and night, noble son, I could count each drop of rain, but
There is no need to say much, but if, for example, a million tathāgatas like me were to be in one place for an eon, provided with all requirements, with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils
still those tathāgatas would not be able to calculate the accumulation of merit from the six-syllable mahāvidyā
so it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in this world
Noble son, I have entered the yoga of meditation through an inconceivable dhyāna
an imperceptible Dharma, an unknown Dharma; it is the attainment of the ultimate essence
Noble son, I also wandered through many hundreds of thousands of millions of tens of millions of worlds, and the
in front of Tathāgata Amitābha, with palms placed together, I wept because of my emotion for the Dharma
At that time, Tathāgata Amitābha, who knew the present and the future
Noble son who is united with the yoga of meditation, do you desire the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās
I do desire it, Bhagavat
Bhagavat, be my protector, refuge, and support
Noble son, look! The Tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama has been to many millions of trillions of worlds for the six-syllable mahāvidyā. The Tathāgata has traveled like this, noble son, so therefore give him the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās
How would one apprehend the Bhagavat’s lotus-hook hand gesture? How would one know the Maṇidhara hand gesture
These are the features of the maṇḍala
To create the body of Tathāgata Amitābha, sprinkle powder made from precious sapphire powder, emerald powder, ruby powder, crystal powder, and powdered silver and gold
All vighnas and vināyakas, yakṣas and rākṣasas, together with the companies of mahākālas, and mātṛs, fled
Meritorious are those beings who, with higher motivation, possess this six-syllable mahāvidyā and repeat, listen to, and contemplate it
the samādhi named Jewel Holder
Bhagavat, where can I go to obtain this mahāvidyā
Bhagavat, I will go to the great city of Vārāṇasī in order to see that dharmabhāṇaka, to bow down to him, and to honor him
He should be seen as being equal to the tathāgatas; seen as being the life of the world
seen as a mass of merit
I will do as the Bhagavat has instructed
So Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin set forth accompanied by many hundreds of thousands of lay bodhisattvas, monastics, boys, and girls
In order to make offerings to the dharmabhāṇaka, they brought divine parasols
divine shoes, diadems, earrings, garlands, armlets, one hundred and eight-string and sixty-four-string necklaces for covering the shoulders, ear adornments, and finger rings; and also various kinds of clothing: monastic robes, clothing commanded by the vidyādharas, and Kaśika cloth
magnolias, oleanders, trumpet flowers, mountain ebony, gardenia, star jasmine, night-flowering jasmine, and so on
beautiful peacocks, brahminy ducks, and delightful mynas
the colors blue, yellow, red, white, and crystal
and also various fruits and flowers
He went to the great city of Vārāṇasī and eventually arrived there
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin saw someone whose conduct was poor, whose behavior was poor, and whose path was imperfect
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin gave him a great offering of parasols, shoes, cloth, adornments, scents, and ointments, and placing his palms together in front of the dharmabhāṇaka
The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans gather to listen to the Dharma from you
You teach a Dharma that is like a great vajra
Many millions of trillions of bodhisattvas come to make offerings to you, as do Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, Āditya, Candra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, Agni, Dharmarāja Yama, and the four mahārājas
Those who indulge in the afflictions create the realms of beings and have the characteristics of saṃsāra
Those who know the six-syllable mahāvidyā will not be polluted by desire, anger, or stupidity
Give me the opportunity of the Dharma! Give me the pure body of perfectly established forms! Give me a good reputation so that all beings say, ‘He has gained unwavering goodness!
Be my protector, refuge, and support
Noble son, people are ordained in various orders and are ordained in the various garments of those seeking liberation
rainbow-colored garments, white garments, and pure white garments
the followers of Viṣṇu and Garuḍa, and naked ascetics. They take ordination in those orders, bu
All the hosts of deities—Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, Śakra, who is the lord of devas, Āditya, Candra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, Agni, Dharmarāja Yama, and the four mahārājas—constantly request the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, it is like this
Bhagavat, how can we obtain the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, so that we can dedicate ourselves to liberation
Prajñāpāramitā is known to be the one who gave birth to all the tathāgatas
Noble son, through this you can obtain anything from within the Mahāyāna: many Mahāyāna sūtras, the geyas, the vyākaraṇas, the gāthās, the udānas, the nidānas, the avadānas, the itivṛttakas, the jātakas, the vaipulyas, the adbhūtadharmas, and the upadeśas. Simply repeating it will bring peace and liberation
We take it home and fill our pots with rice and keep it in there
in accord with the sun, we dry it in the sun’s heat
What is the essence? The essence is the rice
Noble son, one repetition of the mahāvidyā completes the six perfections
so as to have the perfection of generosity, the perfection of conduct, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, the perfection of meditation, and the perfection of wisdom
Possessing its name just once will make them equal to someone who has provided all the tathāgatas with all requisites: with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils
saw someone who had a body white as the autumn moon, a crown of coiled hair, an omniscient buddha upon his head, and a beautiful lotus in his hand, and was adorned with the splendor of lotuses
Noble son, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given permission for the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to be given to you
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin attained these samādhis
the samādhi named Unceasing True Nature
the samādhi named Love, Compassion, and Rejoicing
the samādhi named Practicing Yoga
the samādhi named The King of Arrays
The dharmabhāṇaka presented him with a string of pearls to the value of a hundred thousand silver coins and said
Noble son, in accord with my instruction, present this to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Śākyamuni
having obtained what he sought and with his wishes fulfilled
He went to the Jetavana Monastery, arrived there
bowed down to the feet of Bhagavat Śākyamuni, and sat to one side
There are many hundreds of thousands of many-storied palaces made of divine gold and jewels
They are decorated with braided lengths of strings of pearls and silk, and they are hung with hundreds of strings of pearls
they remember the six-syllable mahāvidyā
and the suffering of being born in the city of the pretas
At that time they are sitting cross-legged
They contemplate sadness concerning the body, thinking
In those many-storied palaces, there are seated tathāgatas who teach the Dharma to the humans in Jambudvīpa
They teach the six perfections
Thus, noble son, they see the pores of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. They also see deities such as devas, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, Maheśvara, and Nārāyaṇa assembled in Jetavana Monastery, and many millions of trillions of bodhisattvas assembled there
Bhagavat, are there no other pores
Noble son, beyond that pore are the four great oceans that come from the big toe of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s right foot
Their depth is immeasurable
When water comes from the right big toe, it falls on Vaḍavāmukha
Bhagavat, is there yet another pore
There are no more, noble son
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will come to this great monastery of Jetavana in order to see me, to bow down to me, to honor me, and to give a prophecy concerning the deity Maheśvara in a realm within this universe
I have done as the Bhagavat instructed. I have accomplished the task
At that time, good omens manifested in Jetavana Monastery
At that time, Jetavana Monastery appeared to shine like divine gold
That is what Jetavana Monastery looked like
The Bhagavat gave his approval, saying, “Noble son, it is excellent that you have accomplished the task. Excellent
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara offered lotus flowers to the Bhagavat an
said, “Bhagavat, the tathāgata Amitābha presents you with these lotus flowers and hopes you are not unwell, not fatigued, that you are in good health, and that life is pleasant.
So the deva Maheśvara went and bowed down to the feet of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara an
who travels around, who brings relief to beings, who completely illuminates the world, and who brings comfort
The deva Maheśvara praised Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara in that way and then sat silently
Then Umādevī came and bowed her head to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s feet an
I pay homage to Avalokiteśvara, great lord, who gives life
who completely illuminates the world
and who holds the Dharma
Umādevī praised Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara in that way and then said
Look, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given them prophecies of the highest complete enlightenment
there are the kings of mountains Mount Cakravāla and Mount Mahācakravāla, the kings of mountains Mount Mucilinda and Mount Mahāmucilinda, the kings of mountains Mount Kāla and Mount Mahākāla, the kings of mountains Mount Saṃsṛṣṭa and Mount Mahāsaṃsṛṣṭa, the king of mountains Mount Pralambodara, the king of mountains Mount Anādarśaka, the king of mountains Mount Kṛtsrāgata, the king of mountains Mount Jālinīmukha, the king of mountains Mount Śataśṛṅga, the king of mountains Mount Bhavana, the king of mountains Mount Mahāmaṇiratna, the king of mountains Mount Sudarśana, and the king of mountains Mount Akāladarśana
I can calculate, noble son, the number, parts, and groups of how many palas are in those mountains, how many hundreds of palas, or thousands of palas, or millions of trillions of palas, but
noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
I can count each leaf in a forest of agarwood trees, but
I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit
If someone were to provide tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils for an eon, the accumulation of merit that would come from serving those tathāgatas would only equal the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
the samādhi named Adorning
the samādhi named Vajra Garland
the samādhi named Sublime Gift
the samādhi named Creating Nirvāṇa
the samādhi named Creating Infinite Light Rays
When the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Krakucchanda, appeared in this world
at that time I was a bodhisattv
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Creating Indra
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra opened up his pores
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara opened all his pores
At that time, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, ‘Avalokiteśvara, it is excellent that you have this capability. Excellent.
Bhagavat, I pray that you teach the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, so that we will enjoy and be satisfied by the taste of the Dharma
You will no longer continue in saṃsāra
You will not be separated from that which is beloved and pleasant, and will not encounter that which is disliked
You will go, noble son, to the realm of Sukhāvatī
You will hear the Dharma from Tathāgata Amitābha
The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, gandharvas, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans all departed
Those bhikṣus who wish to give complete ordination should first go and examine the various locations
Noble ones, the various locations are completely pure
Those various places are completely pur
and are worthy for bhikṣus to give ordination
Those who have incorrect conduct should not give ordination
They cannot even make the announcement of the request for ordination, the intermediate motions, and the fourth
There will be those kinds of recipients of offerings three hundred years after my passing into nirvāṇa
They will use the saṅgha’s seats, stools, clothing bags, cushions, and beds, which are prohibited to them
They will urinate and defecate in the places the saṅgha uses
Bhikṣus, the exclusive property of the Saṅgha
such as the embers of the saṅgha’s fire, the smoke of the saṅgha, the vajras of the saṅgha, or the baggage of the saṅgha, should not be used

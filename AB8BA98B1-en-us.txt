The Noble Dhāraṇī of the Buddha’s Essenc
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
Thus did I hear at one time
The Blessed One was seated upon a lion throne in a seashore grove surrounded on all sides by the forest that was the Buddha’s domain
There, he taught the Dharma to a retinue of gods that had gathered around and paid their respects to him
The Blessed One addressed the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa realm such as Maheśvara, Suvrata, and the rest, saying
“Gods, listen well, pay attention, and I will teach
The Thus-Gone One, in order in future times to gather a fourfold retinue, look after them, care for them in all manner of ways, and cause them to advance, to bring those who possess all the teachings and their meanings to perfection, and to bring all who are properly established in the Great Vehicle to specific attainment in all its aspects
teaches and explains the dhāraṇī discourse called The Buddha’s Essence
You should retain it and, both now [and in future times] after I have passed into parinirvāṇa
[You should retain it and, both now and] in future times [after I have passed into parinirvāṇa,] teach and explain it to all members of the fourfold retinue who are properly established in the Great Vehicle
Never forsake it, and always teach i
and promote it
As long as there are beings who are destitute and affected by the obscurations, you should preserve the teaching of the Thus-Gone One for them, teach it
and promote it.
The gods replied, “Blessed One, we will do just that
We will sincerely and perfectly carry out the Thus-Gone One’s command.
The Blessed One addressed them, saying
“Gods, this is the Dharma discourse called The Buddha’s Essence

“Gods, this is the dhāraṇī discourse called The Buddha’s Essence
If noble sons or daughters from the fourfold community who are properly established in the Great Vehicle wear it on their bodies, recite it well, an
uphold it, they will never give rise to inferior mental states
The Thus-Gone One will likewise remain with them, seated above the crowns of their heads
Some will certainly see the Buddha
some will hear him teach
some will become Dharma teachers, an
some will gain the dhāraṇī power of not forgetting
Students who are on the path will never have that path interrupted, and they will have a continual stream of Dharma teachers
They will understand everything, never forget it, an
be only one birth away from awakening
With those qualities, they will gain the power of retaining the entire ocean of knowledge
They will receive all the attainments, beginning with acceptance of the fact that phenomena do not arise up to becoming fully liberated, perfect buddhas who are free from obscurations
You gods will understand the meaning of my teachings in this lifetime
You should teach it and promote it among the sons and daughters of the lineage
Do not cast it aside
do not forsake it, an
do not forget it!
The gods responded, “Blessed One, we shall do just as you have said
We will teach and explain the Blessed One’s dhāraṇī discourse called The Buddha’s Essenceto the fourfold assembly, without hesitation, in its entirety
We will teach it and promote it among noble sons and daughters
It will be just as the Thus-Gone One has said
We will fully comprehend the Thus-Gone One’s holy Dharma, an
for the noble sons and daughters will be of great meaning and something of great benefit.
The Blessed One replied
“That is why you gods must do as I have said
This is the teaching that I give to you.
After the Blessed One had spoken
the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa realm such as Maheśvara and Suvrata, along with the entire assembly, praised the Blessed One’s words
This concludes “The Dhāraṇī of the Buddha’s Essence.

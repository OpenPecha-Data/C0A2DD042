homage to Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
Thus have I heard at one time
together with many hosts of vajra yogins and yoginīs
namely
White Acala vajra yogin
Yellow Acala vajra yogin
Red Acala vajra yogin
Green Acala vajra yogin
Delusion Vajrī vajra yoginī
Calumny Vajrī vajra yoginī
Passion Vajrī vajra yoginī, an
Envy Vajrī vajra yoginī
with trillions of yogins and yoginīs, headed by those just mentioned
Then Lord Vajrasattva, having entered the absorption of Black Acala, spoke
Lord Vajrasattva dwelt within the vulva of the goddess of the Vajra Realm, which is the essence of body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas
“Freed from existence and nonexistence
Solely devoted to the four joys
I am naturally without mental elaboration And devoid of all mental constructs
“I am endowed with five form
Then the blessed goddess of the Vajra Realm, having entered the absorption of Hatred Vajrī, said this
“Inseparable from emptiness and compassion
Abiding in pleasure with divine lust
Devoid of all mental constructs am I
Free from mental elaboration and undistracted
In order to benefit those women Who don’t know me as present In the body of every woman.
The lord Black Acala deeply kissed and firmly embraced Hatred Vajrī, and said
“Goddess, goddess! Very enjoyable
Secret and extremely hard to come by
More essential than the essence, supreme
Beautifully taught by all the buddha
The lord of kings of tantras, the supreme
Called Sole Hero
For beings’ swift accomplishment
To one who has not seen its maṇḍala
“This tantra must not be reveale
To someone who has entered a different maṇḍala
“To the one who has entered the maṇḍala of Caṇḍaroṣa, Who is abiding in absorption
Who possesses supreme faith and diligence
“To the one who is devoted to the teacher, compassionate
Wholly engaged in the Mantrayāna
And always devoted to Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
To him should one explain this tantra
should any yogin
“He will be seized by severe illnesses
Soiled by stool and urine
And experience the suffering of death Within six months
“Then, seized by the messengers of Yama
Overpowered by the noose of Time
To hell will he, the evil one, be led
Having experienced suffering for a hundred thousand years
“If, after the exhaustion of his karma
He attains a human birth, He will be destroyed in that birth by a bolt of lightning
Should draw a beautiful maṇḍala
He should cause the disciples— Only those previously examined—to enter there
Difficult to find in the three worlds
“And should then explain this tantra
Anyone who would explain it to one who hasn’t studie
Will follow a downward course
Even though he may be equal to buddhas
“He will suffer inflammation of the mouth
“His head will be split by a thunderbolt
Without any doubt, during the rainy season
This truth, O goddess, I have taught, O beautiful-faced one
This concludes the first chapter, the introduction to the tantra, in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the blessed Hatred Vajrī tightly embraced Lord Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa and said
“What is the size of the maṇḍala, And with what materials should it be drawn
And also, what is to be written in its center? Tell me, O lord!
The lord then said
“The size of the maṇḍala Should be one cubit, two cubits
Three cubits, four or five— But not more than five cubits in measure
“It should be made with powders of whatever substances And of different colors
With four corners, four doors
And adorned with four archways
“One should draw the door the size of One-eighth of the whole maṇḍala
The portico the same size as the door, And the cupola one-half of that
“And also, of such measure, the side, the altar, The garland, the half-garland, and the paṭṭikā
The rajobhuva, however, outside of the base line, Should be one-half of the paṭṭikā
“One should draw the row of vajras of the same size And also the eight pillars
One should make the chief gateway Three times as big as the door
“A double vajra should be drawn below, Surrounded by the vajra-enclosure
The maṇḍala of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa Should be adorned with wish-fulfilling trees, and so on
In the round shape of a circle
In its eight directions, starting from the east
One should draw a multicolored lotus of eight petals
“With the space in the middle being the ninth. In the center of the ninth
a deep-blue sword should be drawn Marked with a vajra and placed together with A vajra-knife and a skull cup
“In the east, one should draw A sword of white color marked with a wheel
In the south, one should draw A yellow sword, inlaid with a jewel
“In the west, one of red color, Marked with a red lotus
In the north, one should draw A plain sword of dark-green color
“In the southeast corner, one should draw A white knife, marked with a wheel
one should draw A yellow one, nicely marked with a jewel
“In the northwestern corner, similarly, A red one, nicely marked with a red lotus, should be drawn
“One should arrange all these signs In position above the sun and the moon
I have taught this maṇḍala of powders To accomplish the benefit of the world
“Alternatively one should prepare a maṇḍala In the form of a canvas-picture, nicely painted
The maṇḍala should be drawn as before
In the center, one should draw Black Acala
“Embraced by Hatred Vajrī
In the east, one should draw White Acala
Similarly Yellow Acala in the south
In the west, one should draw Red Acala
“In the north, one should draw Green Acala
In the southeast, white Delusion Vajrī
Yellow Calumny Vajrī
“In the northwest, one should draw The red goddess Passion Vajrī
In the northeast, draw dark-green Envy Vajrī. So one should draw the canvas-maṇḍala
“Now comes the maṇḍala tutelage mantra
“Oṁ, Blessed Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, together with your retinue, come, come! Jaḥ hūṁ vaṁ hoḥ
Assume tutelage over this maṇḍala! Hūṁ phaṭ! Svāhā
“With this mantra, one should summon, induct, bind, and enthrall Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, and then worship him
“Now comes the worship mantra
“Oṁ, Black Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, White Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Yellow Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Red Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Green Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
“Oṁ, Hatred Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Delusion Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Calumny Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Passion Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
Oṁ, Envy Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ
“The flowers, and likewise the light, the incense, The perfumes, and the food— With these five offerings, One should worship the maṇḍala
“When, however, White Acala is in the center
Together with Delusion Vajrī
The maṇḍala should be known as his
So would be the case with Yellow Acala and so forth
“One should prepare the five maṇḍalas According to the division of the five yogins
With one-pointed mind
Having made an effort to do the prior worship first
Can one offer refreshments of wine and mea
This concludes the chapter on the maṇḍala, the second in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the goddess said
“How should the student be prepared, And how should he be engaged in this tantra? How are his doubts resolved
Please explain this, O great lord!
The lord then said
“First one should give him the triple refuge
Then the five empowerments, The secret empowerment, and lastly the wisdom-consort empowerment
“Then the disciple will be fit
One should explain this tantra to him alone
One should keep others far away
“This is the verse of the triple refuge
Until I attain the essence of awakening
“I go to the Buddha, my refuge
I go to the Dharma, my refuge
And to the Saṅgha, with undivided faith
“This is the verse of the five disciplines
“Killing and also stealing
Seducing another’s wife, false speech
Also the fifth, the intoxicants
The five disciplines, and the fast
“This is the verse of the observance of the fast
“I will not kill living beings
Nor steal another’s property
I will practice celibac
And avoid false words
“I will never drink wine— The cause of intoxicatio
And will avoid dance, song, And ornaments, along with merriment
“High bed, grand bed, And also eating at inappropriate times
In this way, I will keep pure The eightfold vow of the fast, “In agreement with the instructions for the arhats
Just as instructed by the Buddha
When I have conquered the wicked Māra in this wa
And attained the ultimate buddhahood
“I shall become a refuge for all being
For as long as I circle in saṃsāra
a male offspring of the buddhas
“Shall be one who associates with good people
Is wise, and delights in the good of the world
“This is the water empowerment
“Visualizing the disciple to be pure and spotless like a crystal
one should draw some water from the victory ja
“This is the crown empowerment
“One should first fashion a cloth crown that resembles a crown with many gems
Then one should visualize the disciple as a universal emperor
place the crown on his head, and sprinkle him as before
‘Oṁ, Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, enter, enter into his heart! Hūṁ phaṭ!
“This is the sword empowerment
“One should place a sword made of iron or the like in the disciple’s right hand an
sprinkle him as before
‘Oṁ, strike, strike! Kill, kill all the enemies! O sword of knowledge! Hūṁ phaṭ!
“This is the noose empowerment
“One should place a noose made of copper or the like in his left hand, which should display the threatening gesture
‘Oṁ, seize, seize! Pull, pull all the evildoers with the noose! Bind, bind
To you, O great truth, to you, O Dharma, svāhā!
“This is the name empowerment
“One should invite the disciple, crowned with the seal of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
‘Oṁ, blessed lord Black Acala, you are an accomplished being! Hūṁ phaṭ!
Then one should anoint him as before
In this way, the name empowerment of the five Acalas, according to the color division of black and so forth, should be given to the sādhaka
This is the fivefold empowerment
“To women, however, instead of the crown empowerment
a vermillion empowerment should be given
“Visualizing the disciple in the form of the fierce great goddess
‘Oṁ, goddess, enter, enter into her heart! Hūṁ phaṭ!
One should place in her right hand a knife of iron or other material
‘Oṁ, knife, cut, cut the flesh of all the māras! Hūṁ phaṭ!
In her left hand, one should place a human skull
‘Oṁ, skull, hold, hold the blood of all the enemies! Hūṁ phaṭ
Then one should invite her to assume the goddess’s posture, and visualize her in the goddess’s form
‘Oṁ, blessed Hatred Vajrī, you are an accomplished being! Hūṁ phaṭ!
In this way, with the names of the five yoginīs according to the division of colors starting with the black, one should anoint women
To them, however, in place of the wisdom empowerment, the skillful means empowerment should be given
“Now comes the secret empowerment
“The disciple should first offer clothes and so forth to the teache
before presenting him with a girl who is young and beautiful and dear to his heart
‘This girl that I offer you Grants all the pleasures of love
Accept her for the sake of your pleasure. Please have compassion, O lord.
“The disciple should then bow to the teacher, leave the room
‘Oṁ, Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, hūṁ phaṭ!
“The teacher should make offerings to himself with wine, meat, and so forth
and then satiate the wisdom consort
He should unite with her and place the semen and blood obtained from this in the fold of a leaf or such
He should then summon the disciple. Using his ring finger and thumb, the teacher should take the substance and use it to write the syllables hūṁ and phaṭ on the disciple’s tongue
He should then ask the disciple to recite, ‘Ah, pleasure.
“Then the teacher should say
‘Today I will cause the buddha-knowledge to arise
through which lord buddhas of the past, future, and present attain nonabiding nirvāṇa
But you must not speak of this in front of anyone who has not seen the maṇḍala
“Placing the sword against the disciple’s heart
the teacher should continue as follows
If you do speak of it, then…
‘This sword, which is in Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa’s hand, Is very sharp indeed
Whoever breaches the samaya
This sword is dedicated to cutting him up
“In billions of lives
There will be people with swords in their hands
Cutting off all his limbs, Eager to chop off his hea
Then the student should say
‘So be it.
invite him to throw a flower onto the maṇḍala
As the teacher removes the blindfold
he should then point out the maṇḍala to the discipl
and explain its symbolism
Then he should offer the same wisdom consort to the disciple, saying
‘She is your delightful supporter
She is to be served as taught by the buddhas
A fool who transgresses against thi
Will not attain the highest accomplishment.
“Next the teacher should whisper into the disciple’s ear about the division of the four joys
Then the teacher should go out
The wisdom consort should undress and, lying on her back, point to her secret place
‘My dear, are you eage
To eat my impurities
Even if they were feces, urine, and blood
And suck the interior of my vagina?
“The sādhaka should say
To eat your impurities
‘Why wouldn’t I be eager
Until I attain the essence of awakening.
I should practice devotion to wome
“And she should say: “ ‘Ah, whoever serves, According to procedure, this lotus of mine, Which is endowed with every pleasure
To him I will grant accomplishment
Steadily, applying forethought
‘Do what needs to be done in the lotus
For Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa himself Dwells here—the great bliss.
“Then the sādhaka, visualizing himself in the form of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa an
visualizing the wisdom consort in the form of Hatred Vajrī, should make love an
note the four joys
When this is completed
he should offer the gaṇacakra feast with wine and meat, with the teacher as the guest of honor
“This was the wisdom empowerment.
This concludes the chapter on empowerments, the third in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the goddess said
“How should he meditate
The meditator on Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
What mantra should he recite
Please tell me, O great lord!
The lord then said
“In a place pleasing to the min
And free from all distractions
One whose mind is in equipoise Should prepare a pleasant seat. “First one should cultivate loving kindness; Second, compassion; Third, sympathetic ‌joy; And, to complete the lot, ‌equanimity
“Then one should visualize the seed syllable in one’s heart
Standing on the sun, which is on the moon, which is on the lotus. One should visualize Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa in front, Arisen from light rays of the seed syllable
In front of him, he should confess his sin
And rejoice in the virtue
“One should take the triple refuge
One should dedicate the merit
And turn one’s mind to awakening
And, again, absorb him with the rays of light
“Reciting the following mantra
‘Oṁ, I am of the nature of vajra, which is the wisdom of emptiness.
“One should carefully visualize The syllable hūṁ burned by the light rays
Then visualize it burning like camphor
And then one should not visualize even the light rays
To be like space
“Having visualized everything, for a short while
To be translucent like a pure crystal
One should visualize one’s own bod
“One after the other one should visualize Four syllables—yaṁ raṁ vaṁ la
Transforming into, respectively, Wind, fire, water, and earth
“Having then visualized the syllable bhruṁ
One should visualize the temple-palac
That has four corners, four doors
And is adorned with eight pillars
“One should visualize at its cente
A multicolored lotus with eight petals
Arisen from the seed syllable paṁ
And on it, the moon, born from the syllable aṁ
“On it again, the sun born from the syllable raṁ
And above it the syllable hūṁ
One should visualize, born from this, Akṣobhya in union with Māmakī
“The lord of yogins should enter there, Through the crown aperture of Akṣobhya
By the method of a shooting star
Intent on the vagina of Māmakī
“Having then become the essence of semen
He should fall inside her vagina
he should subsequently emerge from there In the complete form of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
“One should kill Akṣobhya, the father, With the sword, and later eat him
One should then visualize him Being eaten also by Māmakī
“Then, having seized Māmakī, the mother, One should make love to her
One should visualize oneself embraced by her
In her form of Hatred Vajrī
His left is holding a noose
He is making a threatening gesture with his index finger
And bites his lower lip with his fangs
“Kicking with his right foot
He is smashing the four Māras
His left knee is on the ground
Squint eyed, he inspires fear
“He points a threatening gesture at Vasudhā
Kneeling on the cap of his left knee
He has Akṣobhya for his crest jewel; He is of blue color and wears a jewel diadem
“A princely youth, Wearing Five Braids of Hair, Adorned with all the ornaments
He appears to be sixteen years old
And his eyes are re
“One should meditate with a steadfast mind
Then, by a churning method
One should emanate White Acala in the east
“One should emanate Delusion Vajrī in the southeast, Of the color of autumnal white lotus
One should emanate Yellow Acala in the south
And Calumny Vajrī in the southwest
“One should emanate Red Acala in the west
And the red Passion Vajrī in the northwest
In the north, one should emanate Green Acala
And in the northwest, green Envy Vajrī
these goddesses rouse the lord With songs coming from their own throats
‘Lord, do not abandon loving kindness And do not become void by nature! If separated from you, I will perish, And so will all beings—each and every one of them.
“From Delusion Vajrī
‘Do not abandon the mind of compassion! O lord, do not become void, Lest my suffering body Becomes devoid of life!
“From Calumny Vajrī
‘Why, O virtuous one, should you abandon sympathetic ‌joy And enter the void? You have made a promise! The entire world rests in your heart.
From Passion Vajrī
‘If you consider me, youthful as I am, The view of the void is fruitless. Abandon the nature of void! Please make love to me!
From Envy Vajrī
‘Lord, do not abandon loving kindness And do not become void by nature
If separated from you, I will peris
O lord, do not become void
Lest my suffering body Becomes devoid of life!
should you abandon sympathetic ‌joy And enter the void
The entire world rests in your heart
Please make love to me
Abandon the nature of void
“Having heard these four songs as if in a dream
One should visualize him in his exact previous form
“Then, having killed White Acala
One should make love to Delusion Vajrī
Assuming the form of White Acala
One should, in turn, kill Yellow Acala
“One should make love to Calumny Vajrī
Oneself having turned into Yellow Acala
Having, in the same way, killed Red Acala
One should make love to Passion Vajrī
“Having turned into Red Acala
One should, in turn, kill Green Acala
One should then make love to Envy Vajrī
Having oneself turned into Green Acala
“Having impassioned the four goddesses
One should absorb the entire maṇḍala
The devotee should ardently visualize Just oneself, embraced
‘I am an accomplished one without any doubt.
A yogin of black complexion Should meditate on Black Acala
“A yogin of white complexion Should meditate on White Acala
A yogin of yellow complexion Should meditate on Yellow Acala
“A yogin of red complexion Should meditate on Red Acala
A yogin of green complexion Should meditate on Green Acala
“A woman who is of black complexio
Should meditate on Hatred Vajrī
A woman who is of white complexio
Should meditate on Delusion Vajrī
“A woman who is of yellow complexio
Should meditate on Calumny Vajrī
A woman who is of red complexio
Should meditate on Passion Vajrī
“A woman who is of green complexio
Should meditate on Envy Vajrī
Every man is a vajra yogin
And every woman is a vajra yoginī
According to the division of colors—the black and so forth
“One should do all these assignation
Alternatively, following the division of the types of action
There would be the fivefold assignation as follows
“Black color is for killing and hatred
Yellow is for paralyzing and enriching
Red is for enthralling and attracting
“Dark green is said to be for expelling
As for the division corresponding to one’s caste
the brahmin is white
the butcher is known to be yellow
“The dancer is red
One of black nature should make love To a black girl with elongated eyes
“One of white nature should make love to a white girl
One of distinctly yellow nature, to a yellow girl
One of red nature should make love to a red girl
One of green nature, for his part, to a green girl
“Or else, whatever girl one finds, Engaged in meditation according to that
One should make love to her with a steadfast mind, In such a way that nobody knows
“They are girls who can grant true accomplishmen
Their sexual fluid is vajra— One should lick it all with one’s tongue
“One should drink their urine as one pleases
Placing one’s face on their vulva
Or, indeed, placing the face on the lotus of their anus
One should eat, as one pleases, their feces
“One must not feel any disgust, not even a little, Otherwise one will lose one’s accomplishment
This private food is the best, Eaten by all the buddhas.
This concludes the deity chapter, the fourth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
“Now I will teach the complete collection of mantras.
So saying, the lord entered the absorption called Victory over All Māras
and presented the collection of mantras

This concludes the chapter on mantras, the fifth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero. Chapter . Completion Stage
Then the goddess Prajñāpāramitā embraced the lord tightly
rubbing her lotus against his vajra, and said
According to the practice of the completion stage
“How should one meditat
For the good of the yoginīs.
Please elaborate on this questio
The lord then said
“Immersed in the practice of the completion stag
a yogin Should visualize my form, With one-pointed mind, day and night
“He should visualize his woman In your form, incisively
Through intensive practice like this
“The mother, and also the daughter
The younger sister, the niece, Or any other female relative
And likewise a female musician or a brahmin
A washerwoman, a prostitute
A lay vow holder, and also a yoginī
Or a female kāpālika
“Or another woman, as available, Well-endowed with feminine beauty
One should make love following the prescribed way
angry Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa Will kill the practitione
Terrifying him with a sword and a noose
And will make him fall into Avīci Hell
“There will be no attainment for him in this world
Nor in the afterlife
Therefore one should maintain absolute secrec
“Like the mantra of the ḍākinī
The sādhana of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇ
It was for the sake of insatiable lover
That I, the Buddha, taught it
“In a place pleasing to the mind, Free from all distractions
The one who is pleasing to the mind
One should secretly start out with her
“Thinking, ‘I am the buddha Acala, A perfected being, and my beloved is Prajñāpāramitā,
The wise practitioner should visualize Their respective divine forms deeply in his mind
“Ensuring that one’s hermitage is privat
One should meditate incisively, Engaging in the union of two lovers
“One should place the woman in fron
And make her sit facing oneself
With mutual passion
the two Should gaze at each other intensely. “Then, focusing on the pleasure of gazing
One should remain with one’s mind focused one-pointedly
At precisely that time, she should say the following words, Which bring on an intensification of pleasure
You are my son, my husband; You are regarded as my brother and father
I am your mother, wife, Sister, and niece
‘In your seven incarnations as a man
You have been my lowly servant
I should be regarded as your owner.
“One should fall to her feet, With one’s hands joined in fervent supplication
One should say at that point the supreme words That intensify the pleasure
‘You are my mother, my father’s wife. You are also my niece
My younger sister, and my daughter-in-law
‘I am your slave in every respect, Filled with ardent devotion
Please look at me with compassion
“Looking at his face facing her
‘Eat my Vairocana
‘Drink the water of Akṣobhya, O son; Be my slave as well as my father
For my part, I am your master And also your mother of royal descent
‘Go for refuge to my feet, O child, continually
Since you have been brought up by me
Give me the pleasure derived from the vajra
Adorned in the middle with a stamen
Look at my three-petaled lotus
‘Ah, this is the field of Sukhāvatī
Adorned with the red buddha
Giving pleasure to impassioned lovers, Tranquil and free from all mental constructs
‘As I lie on my back, Intoxicated from passion
And look me up and down
Then you should insert your throbbing vajra Into the opening in the center of my lotus
‘In my three-petaled lotus, Endowed with a fleshy circle
You should place your vajra ther
And offer pleasure to the mind
Awakened by the tip of the vajra
It is red like a bandhūka flower.
One should meditate on the pleasure arising thence, Motionless, with the incisiveness of mind
‘Wait a moment, my dear
As I consider for a whil
A woman, the sole mother of the three worlds, A gentle giver of true pleasure
‘The foul-mouthed ones, steeped in evil acts, Who out of enmity, revile, in this world
crying, Their bodies burned by many fires, for three eons
‘On the other hand, women’s virtue, Which embraces all beings, should be spoken of
Be it the compassion or the protectiveness
Which is established in their minds. “ ‘Whether one is a friend or a stranger, She nourishes one with alms. If she has such nature, The woman is no other than Vajrayoginī
‘Be it her sight, her touch
or her caress By a mere remembrance of her When she is far away
At that moment, pleasure is obtained
‘The five objects of senses, as found in women
Adorned with all good qualities
Virtuous, virtuous, of great virtue
Be gracious to me, O mother!
“Then, gazing intensely at her
One should bite one’s lower lip with one’s teeth
The yogin should undress her
The position holding the knees
And the position rubbing the thighs
And the position pressing the ground
Similarly the tortoise position
And the one called good in every respect
One should make her clasp her arms Firmly around one’s shoulders
“One should extend one’s own arms To the middle of her wais
insert one’s vajra into her lotus
This position is called the arising of pleasure
“One should put her knees, joined together, Against one’s chest
This position is called holding the knees
“One should put the soles of her feet Against the base of one’s thighs
This position is called the kneading of the thighs
This position is called moving the feet
“One should place her buttocks on the ground
This position is called pressing the ground
One should make her extend her two feet
One should make her extend them one at a time
This position is called variegated
Having again assumed the position of the arising of pleasure
“And with one’s right hand, one should Insert one’s vajra into the lotus
Holding her under her knees
One should push one’s elbows upward
When one puts her two feet Firmly on one’s shoulder
This position is called mounted on a device
With her left foot on one’s shoulder, And the right foot at the base of one’s left thigh
This position is called with the feet upward
It offers genuine pleasure and dispels suffering
“One should place the soles of her feet Evenly in the middle of one’s chest
And should press with one’s arms against her knees— This is called tortoise position
“One should place the soles of her feet On one’s eyes, ears, and hea
This position is called good in every respect
It gives complete sexual satisfaction
“One should kiss her mouth For as long as one likes, again and again
Saying sweet nothings of one’s choice
And drink the saliva produced in her mouth
One should eat the gunk licked off her teeth
Cultivating the feeling of pleasure
With one’s tongue, one should clean Her nostrils and the corners of her eyes
“Also her teeth and her armpits— One should eat all the filth produced there
One should rub the nipples with one’s hand, Then suck and bite them
Recollecting again and again, ‘I was in this very place before.
“One should touch her lotus with one’s hand
While saying, ‘O wind, this is beautiful.
One should give kisses and rub her there with one’s fingers
Then, taking one’s hand away, one should look at it
“Smelling the scent, one should clean The woman’s orifice with one’s tongue
‘As I have entered through this, So also have I emerged many times.
If applied without knowledge
Will lead to the six destinies
“However, if applied with knowledge It will lead to the accomplishment of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
One should eat the semen or blood that is in the lotus
One should scratch her thighs with fingernails And rub her feet like a slave
“One should place the three syllables on her head And give a light blow with a fist on her chest
“One should intently pay attention there, With the mind focused one-pointedly on pleasure
One may ejaculate or not, as one pleases, With the mind focused solely on pleasure
“If one does ejaculate, one should lick the lotus
Falling down to one’s knees. One should consume the semen and the blood That are in the lotus using one’s tongue
“One should drink these substances through one’s nose, Using a straw, in order to increase one’s power
“Having embraced her, one should later Eat fish and meat
One should drink milk or wine In order to make one’s desire arise again
Again, by the method previously described, One should start the union
“By doing this practice, Great bliss is attained
One who knows this practice attains, In this very birth, the level of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
In order to grant accomplishment to the passionate ones
“I have taught this practic
One should place the right shin, with ease, Above the left shin
This is called sattvaparyaṅka posture
It grants complete sexual satisfaction
Assuming the lotus posture
One should extend, above one’s left shin, “With ease, one’s right shin
This is known as vajra posture
One should place the soles of one’s feet on the ground, Each in the same way, parallel
“This posture, known to give complete sexual satisfaction, Is called the squatting posture
One should place the soles of one’s feet on the ground, With the feet at an oblique angle, extended sideways
“This is known as the half-moon posture; It gives complete sexual satisfaction
One should place both knees flatly on the ground
With the buttocks between the ankle
“This is called bow posture
It gives heavenly sexual pleasure
Sattva, lotus, and vajra Are considered postures
“Squatting, half-moon, and bow Are regarded as seats
One should make the woman sit in the half-moon posture, And then, without pausing
“Fall down and lick her lotus
Marking the three syllables on her secret place
Having again made her assume the bow posture
As this is the practice of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
One should meditate on the thence-derived pleasure
Free from all mental constructs
One should make one’s mind free from indifferenc
And make love to the mother
“Merit is acquired through passionate affection
Sins are acquired by indifference
There is no greater evil than the absence of passion
And no merit greater than pleasure
“One should therefore focus one’s mind On the pleasure arising from desire.
The goddess rejoiced in her heart, paid homage to and saluted the lord
saying
“O lord, is this means of accomplishment exclusively for humans, o
is it also for other beings?
The lord said
“Those who are impassioned with affection, Who reside in all quarters of the univers
Gods, demigods, humans, nāga
They also succeed as practitioners
When Śiva and other gods heard this
they grasped Gaurī, Lakṣmī, Śacī, Ratī, and other goddesses, and started to meditate
At that moment, all of them instantaneously attained the level of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa an
began to wander on the earth
Among them, Śiva became accomplished as Vajraśaṃkara
Indra as Vajrapāṇi
Kāmadeva as Vajrānaṅga
In this way, the main gods, as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges, became accomplished
Fulfilling the aims of all beings
Endowed with the qualities of the five sensual desires
All possessed of different form
They are victors adept in magic
Just as a lotus, growing out of mud, Is not soiled by dirt or mud
So also they, arisen through experiencing passion
Are not soiled by faults
This concludes the chapter on the practice of the completion stage, the sixth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the goddess said
“The fatigue of any person practicing Sexual intercourse would be great
how to remove this fatigue.
Please deign to explain, O lord
The lord said
“When one has noticed, with one’s own senses, That the pleasure given by the woman has died out
One should eat fish and meat
And drink wine, being focused
Other food too, as available
First he should give to the woman
And eat only what has been left by her
“One should always eat From her dish of leftovers
One should drink the water with which she washes her mouth And the water with which she washes her lotus
One should take the the water with which she washes her anus And rinse one’s mouth with it, and so on
One should also eat her vomit And her excreta
And one should drink water born from her vulva
Just as, after applying compost, The tree will bear more fruit
“In exactly the same way, by partaking of these impurities
For such people, there is neither Old age, nor disease, nor death
Whoever applies himself to these impurities will succeed
One should never think whether Something is edible or not
Even if he does not practice yoga
There is neither merit nor sin
One should not think about higher realms or liberation
The yogin who practices yoga in this way
Through the practice of being one with Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
Even if he were to kill one hundred brahmins
Would not be stained by si
“One should therefore meditate on Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
And violent acts, That would lead ordinary people to hell
All this is preceded by mind
“Forms created by the min
Vary according to one’s place of birth
In the same way that, if one eats a poison Not incanted with the mantra, one’s life will wane
But after incanting the same poison with a mantra, One’s happiness and lifespan will increase
Then, at that moment
The supreme goddess, Perfection of Wisdom‌, With a knife and a skull cup in her hands, And with Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa as the seal upon her head
Vajra-fierce, very angry
Meditating on my form And identifying perfectly with me
She will not be stained by sin
With great wrath alone in her mind
Without compassion, fickle and irritable
With their thoughts on the profits derived from killin
Thus concludes the chapter on revitalizing the body, the seventh in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
“How should a yogin Perceive your form, dear
And by what means should the goddess Be honored by the yogins?
The goddess then said
“Whenever a female form is seen In the world of the three abodes, It should be regarded as my form, Be it of low or respectable family
A goddess or demigoddess
Or a yakṣiṇī, a rākṣasī
A nāginī, a bhūtinī, A kiṃnarī, or a human girl
“A gandharvī, even a female hell-being
A she-animal, a female hungry ghost
A woman from the priestly, warrior, or merchant caste
Or a peasant woman, or one of endless other groups
“A scribe, a princess
A female kāpālika, also a conch worker
A parasol maker, a house builder
A cowherd, a fletcher
A woman of any mixed caste
A mother, a sister, a wife
A maternal aunt, a niece
A paternal aunt, also a mother-in-law
A lay vow-holder, also a yoginī
Or a widow, or a female ascetic
“These and all other women Possess my form
They exist for the welfare of all beings
Each identified by her own individual function
With kisses, embrace, and the like
And with the union of the vajra and the lotus
She should be served by the yogin
“Women who are served will, for their part, instantly grant Accomplishment to all those seeking To benefit living beings
One should therefore serve women
“Women are heaven, women are the Dharma
And women are truly the supreme austerity
Women are the Buddha, women are the Saṅgha, Women are the Perfection of Wisdom‌
They can be divided according to the five colors
With their names assigned accordingl
A woman who is of blue colo
Has been proclaimed as Hatred Vajrī
A woman who is whit
Is known to be Delusion Vajrī
A woman who is yello
Is the goddess Calumny Vajrī
A woman who is pin
Is said to be Passion Vajrī
A woman who is dark-gree
Is said to be Envy Vajrī
“There is only one goddess, wisdom, Abiding in five forms
Conversation, bowing, Folding one’s hands
Beholding and touching her, Thinking of her and talking to her
With kissing, embrace, and the like, One should regularly worship Vajrayoginī
If one is able, one should honor her physically, If not, one should do so verbally or mentally
Worshiped by him, pleased, I shall grant complete attainment
Everywhere, always and invariably, I will be within his sight
Visualizing her in my complete form
One should make love to one’s woma
By the union of vajra and lotus
Therefore, if someone wholly dedicated To propitiating me in all form
He should neither be afraid of nonvirtue, Nor of difficult rebirths—in hell and so on
For as long as he does not obtain power. “There is no evil whatsoever, Nor is there any meri
The conventional distinction between virtue and nonvirtue Is for ordinary people, to be guarded in their minds
Since everything is only mind, And its duration is only momentary
Who is it that goes to hell
And who is it that goes to heaven
Just as one meets one’s death in distress, Thinking that it is caused by poison Even when there is no poison
So too one goes to heaven or the lower realms
Nirvāṇa is attained by the wise ones As the result of a complete understanding of the way things are
Nirvāṇa has the nature of emptiness, Like that of a candle blown out by the wind
Therefore, having renounced everything
A vow-holder should only propitiate me
I grant, instantaneously, the accomplishment of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, there is no doubt
Then the lord said to the goddess, Perfection of Wisdom
Of what form is Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, And of what kind is his accomplishment
The goddess said
The yoginīs are said to be of five types, Corresponding to the five colors
And they have their respective husbands
According to the division of five colors. “And in truth, each of them is Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇ
The husband who is of blue color Is known as Blue Acala
The husband who is of white color— He is called White Acala
The husband who is of yellow color— He is said to be Yellow Acala
The husband who is of pink color— He is said to be Red Acala
The husband who is of dark-green color— He is said to be Green Acala
There is only one Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, Abiding in five forms
He is called Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, As his accomplishment is unflagging
Until the farthermost reaches of space
Just as the accomplishment of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa is described here, So too can the accomplishment of Caṇḍī be gained
Thus concludes the chapter on Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa’s nature, the eighth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the goddess said
The lord said
A yogin should place the woman in fron
He should make his body straight And meditate with one-pointed mind
Because of the nature of the four bodies
A distinction is perceived between wisdom and means. “Death is said to be the dharmakāya
Sambhogakāya is the intermediate state after death
Nirmāṇakāya has the form of the six modes of existence
The pleasure of sex is Great Bliss
This male form, in the three realms, Has the nature of the four bodies
The female form, in the three realms, Also has the nature of the four bodies
The man is the Buddha, Because he has the nature of the four bodies
The woman, present in all directions, Is the Perfection of Wisdom‌
The man should do the deity-identification in the following way
‘I am an accomplished one, Abiding in my own nature— The nature of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
In this way should one meditate with reverence
Having abandoned all activity
Until one attains accomplishment
One should remain with one’s mind focused solely on pleasure
When the yogin has attained accomplishment
He is invisible to people When merged with the prāṇa-mind
Omniscient, omnipresent, all-pervading
Free from all afflictions
For him there is no disease, nor old age
Death does not exist for him
Poison has no effect on him
Neither weapons nor enemy hordes Can ever prevail over him
Merely through a mental wish
Yet all the objects of desire arise for hi
At that moment, one becomes, effortlessly, The same as a wish-fulfilling gem
In all the realms of the world
Wherever one may happen to be, There palaces will arise for hi
With all desired things
Delightful, heavenly women, Adorned with beauty and youth
As numerous as stars in the sky
Will without doubt be his
The gods, such as Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, Indra, Kāmadeva, and so forth
Will be his servants; And so will all the beings living in the six realms
Just as the yogins attain accomplishment, In exactly the same way do the yoginīs
The men have the form of Vajradhara, The women that of the ‌vajra-woman
Then the goddess said
“In what way, O lord, does Great Bliss arise in the body through the union of wisdom and means?
The lord said
The lalanā channel, with the nature of wisdom
And the rasanā, with the nature of means
Is located on the right
In the center between the lalanā and the rasan
When the wind in the avadhūtī has become Of the same essence with semen
Passing through the opening of the penis, inside the vagina of the woman
By the union of the wisdom and the means
Caṇḍālī, who is located at the navel
Burns like a lamp—through this The best semen is caused to flow
Through this arises a lesser bliss, If the effort applied is small
With big effort, the bliss is intense— For this is the nature of things
Whoever can engender this bliss Through regular practice
“Will become glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa In this very life.
This concludes the chapter on meditation, the ninth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
“Is it possible, O lord, to attain the level of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa even without a woman
Or is it not possible?
The lord replied
“It is not possible, O goddess.
The goddess said
“Is it impossible, O lord, because bliss does not arise?
The lord said
Only by the arising of a particular kind of bliss Can it be reached, not otherwise
It is produced only through the right cause. And the cause is union with a woman; There is no other cause, ever
Among all illusions
Only the illusion of a woman is praised
Whoever would transgress against her Will not attain accomplishment
Therefore separation from wome
Must never take place
So if there should occur suffering
Death, bondage, or fear
One should put up with all of this, Rather than abandon a woman
Without modesty, fickle, impudent
Wholly in pursuit of desires
Yet they alone grant accomplishment
What can be said of the nature of woma
Therefore all women should be viewed As goddesses on all occasions
Even wood, stone, and other object
Should be imagined, in one’s mind, as such
“For a woman, the man is a deity; For a man, the woman is a deity
They should honor each other By uniting the vajra and the lotus
Therefore the yogin, filled with compassion, Should set up the maṇḍala in front
“Then he should lead the woman there In her form, which is none other than Perfection of Wisdom‌
One must worship her with flowers, Lamps, incense, and so forth
Then one should circumambulate her clockwis
“In the same way, a woman should worship a man— With respect, and with the mind filled with devotion
She should perform the worship, in reciprocity, As has been taught by the victorious ones
“One must not scold a woman
Nor can one abandon her when being asked for a favor
One should speak nice word
And give her things according to need
So that she does not perceive one as a villain
One must never abandon a woman wherever one may be, After hearing this teaching of the Buddha
Whoever should act otherwise
That evildoer will end up in hell
Apart from causing his own death, Does he achieve anything by separating himself from women
This practice of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇ
Can never be accomplished by religious austerities
It would be fruitless due to the net of delusio
A lover must not abandon lust, Lest he would be living a lie
By living a lie, evil is incurred; And from evil, a rebirth in hell
He who lives a lie will meet his death, There is no doubt
So one should not torment oneself with austerities
Abandoning the five sense-objects
And listen to the sound
“One should smell the odo
And savor the supreme taste
One should experience the sensation of touch
Pursuing the five types of sense-objects
One will quickly become awakened
There is no greater deception, And no greater delusion
Than a man spending his entire youth Without bringing enjoyment to women
Having seen that the seat of Caṇḍaroṣa Is nestled within the vulva of a woman
How would they be able to sleep, eat, or laugh, If they abandoned it
The son of Māyādevī—the wise teache
And went to the bank of Nairañjanā
This was not so, since it was in the female quarters, that the Buddha, Experiencing pleasure in the company of Gopā, became accomplished
“It is from the union of the vajra and the lotus That true pleasure is derived
Awakening is attained through pleasure
And there is no pleasure in being separated from women
However, he who enacts separatio
Namely the victorious master of illusory displays— Enacts his part in that very for
By criticizing women In all the sūtra and Abhidharma literature
He would teach different levels of training, His words concealing the truth
He would also explain nirvāṇa As being the result of the cessation of the five aggregates
Then the blessed lady Prajñāpāramitā said
“Who is that blessed one, the son of Māyādevī
and who is Gopā?
The blessed lord said
“I am the son of Māyādevī, Who has now become Caṇḍaroṣaṇa
As many women as there are
Men, on the other hand, are all said To be endowed with my form
The Blessed Lady then said
“Why, O lord, do the listeners and their like belittle women?
They all abide in the realm of desire
Those who are called listeners and so forth
They do not know the path to liberatio
“In a situation where saffron and so on is close by And easy to obtain
Because of their ignorance that had no beginning, Those people are devoid of faith
I, for my part, have concealed it very well
If there is any being among the infinite numbers, Counted one by one
For whom devotion and exertion are paramount
For the sake of its swift attainment of awakening
Thus concludes the chapter on the praiseworthiness of women, the tenth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the blessed lady said
“Are you, O lord, with or without passion?
The blessed lord said
I am everyone, and I pervade everything
Creating everything and destroying everything
I possess all forms, I am the awakened one
I am the creator, the destroyer, a powerful lord full of bliss
Through whatever form Beings may be guided, In that very form
I abide For the benefit of the world
Sometimes I am the Buddha, sometimes a siddha
Sometimes the Dharma, sometimes the Saṅgha
Sometimes I assume the form of a hell being
Sometimes a hungry ghost, sometimes an animal
Sometimes I am a god, sometimes a demigod
Sometimes I assume a human form
I possess all forms, there is no doubt
I am a woman and also a man
Sometimes I have a genderless form
Sometimes I am affectionate, sometimes hateful
Sometimes deluded, sometimes pure
Sometimes I have an impure form
I exist essentially as mind
It is my mind that is perceive
I can be categorized as a thing or a no-thing
I am one that can be generated, and also one who generates
I am an obstacle and I am an accomplishment
Abiding in every form
I am birth and I am death
I am disease and I am old age
I am virtue and I am nonvirtue, And I am the karmic result of these two
And all these forms are of mysel
They should be known as forms, in essence the same
Then the blessed lady said
“Are these forms only of you?
The blessed lord said
Such forms are of yourself, as well; All that has been explained
All this is permeated by yo
Thus concludes the chapter of the universality of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, the eleventh in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the blessed lady said
Please explain about applying mantras— The pacifying and the enriching
The practices of enthralling and summoning; The killing, the driving away, and so forth
The removing of poison, the removing of disease
The stopping of a fire or a sword
Also the victory in battl
And the most eminent scholarship
The sādhana of yakṣiṇīs that inducts them into service, The sādhanas of dūtas and bhūta
‘What boon shall I grant you?
The sādhaka should reply
‘Grant me the state of awakening.
Then the lord will enter his body
As soon as he enters
the bodily form of a sixteen-year-old an
the six superknowledges
the master of the thirteenth bodhisattva level
living in a celestial mansion, with a retinue of hundreds of thousands apsaras gracing him
He obtains an alluring form, becomes omniscient and just like the lord Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
shoes for sky-travel, foot ointment for fast walking
a kingdom
superhuman potency for sensual gratification
knowledge of spells, wealth
yakṣas, yakṣiṇīs
one should request, according to one’s wish
the lord will give all of this
“Or else one could commission someone to paint Sole Hero on a canvas and practice as before
Here in the painting of Sole Hero
Black Acala is embraced by Hatred Vajrī
White Acala by Delusion Vajrī
Yellow Acala by Calumny Vajrī
Red Acala by Passion Vajrī
and Green Acala should be painted embraced by Envy Vajrī
Or else the lord should be painted alone, without a consort
“As another option, the blessed lady should be painted on the canvas alone in the center, between the five Acalas
Then, imagining oneself as having the form of her husband
Or, imagining one’s own wife as having the form of the goddess, one should do the practice
Being accomplished, she can grant even the state of awakening, let alone other accomplishments
Or one should do the practice of the lord standing with his left leg outstretched and the right slightly bent, and holding a sword and a noose
sitting in the sattvaparyaṅka posture an
holding a sword and a noose in his hands
would be the accomplishment involving the lord painted on canvas
one made of either quality iron or hard woo
One should grasp it with both hands an
recite the mantra at the three junctions of the day for one month
At the end of the month, one should offer extensive worship and recite for the entire night
In the morning, the sword will burst into flames
One then becomes the holder of the magical power of the sword
with the bodily form of a sixteen-year-old with curled hair
And so also with a noose made of copper and so on
Similarly, with a vase
shoes
clothes, a parasol
a Prajñāpāramitā text
a tantra text, and so forth
So too one can practice with a paṭaha drum, a mardala drum, a lute, and so forth
In the same way, one should practice with a golden yakṣa, starting with Jambhala, Maṇibhadra, Pūrṇabhadra, and Cibikuṇḍalin
In the same way, one should practice with a gandharva made of bamboo
a garuḍa made of anthill clay
the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, Indra, Kāmadeva, and so forth, made of deodar tree
a rākṣasa drawn with charcoal from the charnel ground

Ārambhā, Urvaśī
Śrībhūṣaṇī, Ratī, Śacī, and so forth
the sun, the moon
Mars, Mercury
Jupiter, Venus
Saturn, Rāhu, and Ketu
the nine planet
Similarly the practice of the bodhisattvas, starting with Avalokiteśvara, Vajrapāṇi, and Mañjuśrī
Likewise the practice of the buddhas, starting with Vipaśyin and Śikhin
So too the practice of the bhūtas, starting with Aparājita
Also the messengers, starting with Yamāri
Similarly the servants, starting with Vajrakaṃkāla
In the same way, one should do the practice of all beings—women and men
All of them will carry out one’s orders
Now if one does not succeed the first time
one should do it for the second time
If this is likewise unsuccessful, one should do it for the third time
If one does not succeed even then due to previously committed evil acts
then, standing astride with one’s left knee and right foot on the ground
one should recite the mantra until one succeeds
After this, even a slayer of a brahmin would succeed
For the above practices of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, the following mantras apply
‘Oṁ, Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, come, come! Hūṁ phaṭ!
If practicing with the sword and so on
one should add: ‘Make such and such respond to my practice!
When placing the feet astride, one should add: ‘Kill such and such, kill!
In this way, with a single recitation
one burns even the five inexpiable actions
One should add: ‘Destroy all my evil!
“In this way, by a mere utterance, one effects the protection from all fears
One should add: ‘Protect me, protect!
Then, visualizing the iron as if ablaze
one should incant mustard seeds, mung beans, or māṣa pulses with one’s personal mantra  times
They will all flee
At the time of striking, one should add the mantra: ‘Make the ḍākinīs and the rest go away!
in a pair of vessels of unbaked clay
Then one should write the mantra with chalk inside an eight-petaled lotus and cover it with a li

this effects protection of children
One should add the mantra: ‘Protect the child, protect!
One should make a beeswax effigy of the target, four finger-widths high
One should inscribe the mantra on birch bark
place it in the effigy’s heart, and strike the spot with black mustard seeds or similar substances
One should then nail the mouth with a thor
the mouth of the opponent will be sealed
One should bury the effigy at a crossroads. Similarly one should nail the feet
which will stop the target from moving about
One should then add the mantra: ‘Nail the mouth of such and such!
One should add the mantra: ‘Nail the feet of such and such!
One should then add the mantra: ‘Nail the heart of such and such!
with a nail of human bone, or an iron one
Whichever limbs one nail
will become weak and in great pain
One should add the mantra: ‘Nail such and such body part of such and such a person!
By burying the effigy at someone’s entrance door, one will make the resident homeless
One should add the mantra: ‘Make such and such homeless!
By throwing incanted ashes from a charnel ground at someone’s doorway, one will expel him
One should add the mantra: ‘Expel such and such!
Having incapacitated the effigy with thorns, one should recite the mantra
One should add the mantra: ‘Kill such and such!
Having used one’s personal mantra to incant a sword or the like  times
one should engage in battle. One will meet with victory
Having incanted a peacock’s feather with  recitations of one’s personal mantra, one should brush the place affected by a bad disease or sickness
One should add the mantra: ‘Destroy such and such disease of such and such a person!
There will be an appeasement of all ailments
One should add the mantra: ‘Destroy the poison in such and such!
Likewise one should contemplate a person who is one’s target as enthralled, being at one’s service, paying a visit at one’s own place, naked, with disheveled hair, in front of oneself
Visualizing him as fallen to one’s feet, one should recite the mantra. Then the enthrallment will take place
One should add the mantra: ‘Bring such and such to the state of enthrallment!
In the same way as before, one should recite the mantra while contemplating him as being drawn toward oneself. The target will be brought into one’s presence
One should add the mantra: ‘Draw such and such into my presence!
One should add the mantra: ‘Bring prosperity to me!
One should write this mantra with a thorn on a betel leaf, in the center of a space delimited by two intersecting triangles
and chew the betel together with five grains of black pepper
Destroy all the fevers
One should add the mantra: ‘Destroy all the fevers!
At the time of a lunar or solar eclipse
one should fill a bowl with rice cooked with milk or curd
adding sugar and clarified butter
One should place that on top of seven leaves from the bodhi tree an
cover it with another seven leaves
Holding it up with both hands
one should recite the mantra for as long as one is not liberated
By eating it, one will live for five hundred years
Following the same procedure, one should imbue with efficaciousness yellow orpiment, the pigment of bovine gallstones, realgar, or lampblack
If it bursts into flames, one will become a vidyādhara by applying it as a tilaka on one’s forehead or an ointment
If it produces smoke, one will attain invisibility
If it releases heat, an enthrallment will take place
make, from the wood of cobra’s saffron, the king of nāgas, Ananta
Having submerged him, face down, in water
one should recite the mantra while looking into the sky
One should employ the mantra: ‘Seize Ananta, seize! Cause him to send rain!
The god will then send rain
Then one should take Ananta out of the water
bathe him in milk, and release him
Then, gazing at the clouds, one should recite the mantra
Stop all the wind and rain
One should add the mantra: ‘Stop all the wind and rain!
These rites belong also to the second and third root mantras
And only these rites belong to the heart mantras
One should write the first garland mantra with a thorn on an umbrella tree leaf an
wrap it using blue cloth and blue string
‘With my angry mind, I will destroy the fever of such and such a person.
This will destroy all fevers
At the time of tying the amulet, one should make the sick person face east an
lustrate him with a bowl full of grilled fish, rice, wine, and so forth
One should say, ‘After eating this, may all fevers and diseases quickly go away
Lord Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa is ordering this
If you don’t go away
then the lord, angered, will chop you up with a sharp sword into smithereens as small as sesame seeds
After saying this
one should offer an oblation in the southwestern quarter
will then become well
In the same way, an oblation should be offered in the event of any disease, attacks by ḍākinīs, or other misfortunes
One effects protection from all types of fear merely by reciting the mantra
Moreover, saying the root mantra will accomplish all
Only this ritual belongs to the second garland mantra
One should incant a cake of leftovers with the third garland mantra and offer it
This will bring fulfillment of wishes
One should incant a cake of rice an
offer it at evening twilight in a secluded place
Then any objective one aims for will be accomplished
The remaining part of the ritual is as before
Following the method previously described
one should start on the first day of the bright fortnight and proceed as before until the day of the full moon
The preliminary practice is completed with ten thousand recitations of the garland mantras
These rites, as was the case with the rites belonging to the root mantra, call for deity-specific mantras
Just as the mantra rituals of the lord are to be performed
so also are they to be performed for the goddesses
In particular, through reciting, poetic and scholarly skills will quickly arise
Now comes the ritual involving the third root mantra
One should climb on to one’s bed and, holding one’s penis with the left hand, recite  times
The mantra to recite is
‘Oṁ, Vauherī, may such and such come to me! Hūṁ phaṭ!
Whoever’s name one includes in the mantra, she will arrive. One should make love to her
Whoever’s name one includes in the mantra, she will arrive
One should incant mustard seeds seven times and strike a person with them
he will become free from disease
One can also perform this mentally
Having incanted water, one should strike; blood will flow
Having incanted clothes
one will become dear to all people
Any person into whose food or drink one puts incanted salt will become enthralled. “Any person around whose neck one ties a rope made of cow’s hair, having first incanted this rope
will become a cow
Whoever’s name one recites while facing the sun, one will bring that person into one’s presence
Any person around whose neck one ties a rope made of cat’s hair will become a cat
By using a rope made of crow’s sinews, that person will become a crow
With a rope of man’s hair, a woman will become a man. With a rope of woman’s hair, a man will become a woman
In this way, with whoever’s hair the rope is made, the target will turn into that respective form
Whoever’s name one should recite, one will draw that person’s blood
Whoever one looks at with unblinking eyes while reciting the mantra, that person will become enthralled
“These were the rites belonging to the mantra of the goddess
One should offer an oblation with the oblation mantra
All the obstacles in the form of calamities, disease, and the like, will be pacified
In whatever endeavor one may be involved, one should offer an oblation
and one will succeed in it
A bowl with white flowers, another one with milk, another with perfumed water, and another with rice
these four bowls and an offering of the main and auxiliary fruit
in the quiet of the nigh
‘Oṁ, Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, take this oblation, take! Accomplish my task! Hūṃ phaṭ!
by reciting  times
One’s wishes will come true
Then, with  recitations of the root mantra of the lord
inside the vagina of a pregnant woma
make her drink it. She will give birth with ease
By dressing a wound with this oil alone, the wound will heal. All these things can also be achieved by ingesting this oil
One should write the first garland mantra on birch bark, in the center of a sixteen-petaled lotus
One should wrap it with a blue cord and wear it on one’s body
One should write the mantra with the pigment of bovine gallstones or red lac
So also can the methods described in other tantras and practice manuals be employed here
In the same way, all endeavors of a yogin, who relies on meditative cultivation, will be successful
Thus concludes the chapter on all the rites involving mantras, twelfth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
The goddess then said
What conduct should be followed by a yogin
And what practice ought to be done
The lord said
Killed should be the evil ones— Those who disparage the Buddha’s teaching
Having seized their wealth, One should perform the benefit of beings
All widows should indeed be attended upon
One should consume fish and meat
And drink wine, in a state of mental equilibrium
Will succeed by applying this secret discipline
By whatever wickednes
Beings go to lower states of existence
The goddess Hatred Vajrī then asked the lord
“How, O lord, would you explain the inverted conduct?
The lord then said
By passion, passion is killed; A conflagration is killed by fire
One should destroy poison with poison, Applying the instructions
Cultivating the thought, ‘I am an accomplished one,
One should keep all one’s practice very secret, So that nobody knows
Having extinguished all one’s negativity
One succeeds by means of the inverted conduct alone
A yogin, solely devoted to yoga, Who does not keep it secret
Will not have success In this inverted conduct
I have not disclosed thi
Only now do I teach it in truth
In the form of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, O beloved
Listen now, O beloved
One should not kill living beings Or take another’s property
A wise one should never drink wine
One should place a diadem on one’s hea
And a pair of earrings on one’s ears
Anklets should be placed around one’s ankles
And likewise a girdle around one’s waist
In one’s right hand, one should hold a sword; In the left, a noose
On the head, a crown-seal should be placed, Representing the five buddhas
One should attach to one’s head the five strips of colored cloth And shave off one’s hair and beard
One should prepare this girl According to the previously explained division of families
One should always bedeck her with adornments Suitable for a girl
One should place in her right hand a kartri knife, And in the left, a skull cup
A paramour of a select category should arrange such requisites On his partner’s body according to the division of families
One should take a wisdom-consort from one’s own spiritual family, Or any other spiritual family, keeping a focused mind
One should collect the objects of worship as one wishes And commence the practice itself
In the absence of jewels and the like
Alternatively one should create things mentally If they cannot be physically obtained
One should practice the five pledges According to the fivefold family division
Using the method as previously described
The yogin will succeed in every way; No other action needs to be performed
After the union of the wisdom and the means
One should scratch her and inscribe the three syllables
One should give kisses and embraces
The perfection of giving becomes thus fulfilled— There is no doubt
One’s body, speech, and mind wholly engaged And controlled in concordance with one’s intense pleasur
This should be known as the perfection of discipline
The nail-wound, patiently endure
The suffering of the inscribed three syllable
This alone is the perfection of patience
With reverence and for a long tim
This should be known as the perfection of diligence
Because of engaging one’s mind in the pleasure of it
It is regarded as the perfection of concentration
This is proclaimed to be the perfection of wisdom‌
Merely by this single method of exquisite pleasure
The six perfections become fulfilled
If the five perfections are merit
The knowledge is wisdom—so it is said
When united in the union of exquisite bliss
One who is endowed with merit and wisdo
Will succeed in an instant
Just like a fruit growing on a creeper Is endowed with a flower
A full awakening will happen within a momen
With the two accumulations already completed
One becomes master of the thirteen stages, There is no doubt
The stages should be known as Joyful
Pure, Beacon of Light
Resplendent, Invincible
Facing Directly, Going Far, Immovable
Auspicious Intelligence, Cloud of Dharma
All Luminous
These are the thirteen names
This concludes the chapter on practice, the thirteenth in the glorious tantra of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa called the Sole Hero
Then in that gathering, a vajra yogin called Samantabhadr
said this to the Blessed One
why do we use the names Acala (Immovable), as well as Ekallavīra (Sole Hero) an
Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa (Great Fierce Angry One)
May I ask, O lord
The Blessed One replied
Because of the union of wisdom and skillful means
It is the wisdom and skillful means itself
And therefore cannot be swayed by dispassion
For this very reason is it called Acal
One with the nature of Vajrasattva
Two-armed and single-faced, tranquil
Holding a sword and a noose in his two hands
Supremely devoted to embracing the Wisdom
Sitting in sattvaparyaṅka postur
On top of a lotus, a moon, and a sun
Abiding happily in divine bliss
It is for this reason that he is called Acal
All the victorious ones of the three time
Samantabhadra then said
What is expressed by the syllable a What by the syllable ca, And what by the syllable la
Of what are they an abridgement
The Blessed One said
By the syllable a is expressed The unfabricated innate nature
The syllable ca expresses joy, Supreme joy, the joy of cessation, and innate joy. “This syllable expresses The nature of the thus-named four joys
The syllable a expresses wisdom
The syllable ca expresses means
The syllable la, because of its indicating pleasure, Expresses the union of wisdom and means
He himself is the sole hero
Because he destroys dispassion, he is a hero Called Ekalla (Alone)
“Caṇḍa means that he is exceedingly fierce, Known as Mahāroṣaṇa (Great Angry One)
Roṣaṇa should be understood as angr
The one who crushes all the māras
Strong dispassion indeed goes by the name Caṇḍa (Fierce One)
Roṣaṇa is angry at hi
Focused in absorption, Controlling the brahmanical cord with one’s left ankle
With fangs showing between the lips, angry
By means of the above mudrā, the yogin
Tightly embracing the wisdom
Will attain the accomplishment of Buddha
This concludes the chapter on how to construe the name Acala, the fourteenth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the blessed lady, Delusion Vajrī, said
How can Sole Hero be actualized
Tell me, O supreme lord
The lord then said
Starting from the syllable ā, One should instantly visualize Black Acala
Then, merely by the power of stability
The yogin will certainly become a buddha
One should meditate on White Acala
Or the yellow one, or the red one
Or one should meditate on the green one
Embraced by Hatred Vajrī, and so forth
One should visualize him alone, Assuming him to be the central figure among the five Acalas
The wisdom should belong to his spiritual family, Or alternatively one should visualize her as being from another spiritual family
By this method, the yogi
Will swiftly attain success, there is no doubt
Or else one should visualize him, with a focused mind, Without the wisdom-consort
One will obtain the kingdom of awakening
Then the Blessed Lady said
Concerning the purities of the deity’s domain— I would like to hear about it, O guide
I will now explain about The purities that purify everything
On that topic, the four corners are the four immeasurable states
The four doors are the four truths
The four gateways are the four concentrations
The eight pillars are the noble eightfold path
The single chamber is the one-pointedness of mind
The lotus is the vulva
Its various colors are the various emanations
The nine deities are the nine sections of scripture
The redness in the cardinal directions is the great affection
The colors yellow, dark-green, white, and black in the intermediary direction
are the priestly, merchant, warrior, and peasant castes
The moon and the su
The sword in the center is the emblem of Black Acala
In the intermediate directions, they represent their respective goddesses, starting with Delusion Vajrī in the southeast
These are the purities of the maṇḍala
Now the purities of meditation are described
Emptiness, which is the accumulation of wisdom, is an apotheosis of death
The luminous body represents the body of the intermediate state
The full extent of the temple-palace represents the Buddha’s abode
The lotus represents the vulva
The moon and the sun represent semen and menstrual blood
The syllable hūṁ is the consciousness in the intermediate state, in between the mother and the father
Akṣobhya is the father
Māmakī is the mother
Seeing their mutual passion
one feels aversion for the father an
attraction for the mother
Because of delusion, one enters as the consciousness of a new being
One emerges from the womb as a newborn
One kills the father in order to take his place
The sons, for their part, are patricides, wholly intent on fornication, and nothing but enemies. One should therefore kill them
As for the daughters, one should make love to them because of motherly love received in one’s former births, and also for the sake of exquisite pleasure
and seizes the mother because of motherly love received in one’s former births, and also for the sake of exquisite pleasure
One, too, begets sons and daughters, who are, respectively, White Acala, Delusion Vajrī, and so forth
The sword is wisdom, and the noose is skillful means
Or the noose is wisdom, and the sword is skillful means
Their both being of the same essence is represented by the threatening gesture
The left-downward glance signifies protecting the seven underground paradises
The right-upward glance signifies protecting the seven egg-of-Brahmā worlds
The left knee resting on the ground signifies protecting the earth
The right foot thrust forward signifies frightening all the māra
Brahmā is the māra of the aggregates
Śiva is the māra of the afflictions
Viṣṇu is the māra of death
and Śakra is the māra of the divine son
The sun-and-moon seat signifies being conceived in the womb
The male form born from sperm and menstrual blood is existence
whereas the female form is nonexistence
White is form
Yellow is sensation
Red is perception
and Green is formation
Alternatively Blue Acala is space
White is water
Yellow is earth
Red is fire
and Green is win
as for the blessed lords, so too it is for the blessed ladies
Alternatively Blue Acala is the very pure wisdom of the sphere of phenomena
White is the mirror-like wisdom
Yellow is the wisdom of equality
Red is the wisdom of discrimination
and Green is the action-accomplishing wisdom
There is only one victorious teache
Abiding in five forms
Prajñāpāramitā, too
is one Abiding in five forms
This concludes the chapter on purities, fifteenth in the glorious tantra of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa called the Sole Hero
Then the Blessed Lady said
How does the world come into being
How does accomplishment come about
Tell me, O supreme lord
The Blessed One then said
Formations have ignorance for their cause
Consciousness has formations for its cause
Name and form have consciousness for their cause
The six cognitive fields have name and form for their cause
Contact has the six cognitive fields for its cause
Sensation has contact for its cause
Craving has sensation for its cause
Grasping has craving for its cause
Becoming has grasping for its cause
Birth has becoming for its cause
Old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, despair, and turmoil have birth for their caus
in this way arises this whole great heap of suffering
In the same way, when ignorance ceases, there is the cessation of formations
When formations cease, there is the cessation of consciousness
When consciousness ceases, there is the cessation of name and form
When name and form cease, there is the cessation of the six cognitive fields
When the six cognitive fields cease, there is the cessation of contact
When contact ceases, there is the cessation of sensation
When sensation ceases, there is the cessation of craving
When craving ceases, there is the cessation of grasping
When grasping ceases, there is the cessation of becoming
When becoming ceases, there is the cessation of birth
When birth ceases, old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, despair, and turmoil also ceas
in this way, this entire great heap of suffering ceases
The world arises dependently
When one understands these two modes And contemplates them as nondual, one will become accomplished
Then the Blessed Lady said
May the Blessed One present the analysis of ignorance, and so forth
Then the Blessed One said
The Dharma is said by the victorious ones To have twelve forms
With regard to this, ignorance is to be unaware of what to abandon and what to adopt. The meaning is that, directly after death, the insubstantial mind assumes a physical shape
From this ignorance arise formations of which there are three types
the formations of the body are exhalation and inhalation
the formations of mind are attachment, hatred, and delusion
Ignorance, combined with these formations
exhales and inhales
it wanders to and apprehends material objects
and it analyzes and apprehends that which is immaterial
From these formations arises consciousness, which is sixfold
eye-consciousness
ear-consciousness
nose-consciousness
tongue-consciousness
body-consciousness
and mind-consciousness
When combined with these six, ignorance sees, hears, smells, tastes, feels, and cogitates
From this consciousness arise name and form
Form is form alone
With these two put together and rolled into one, we have what is called name and form
Name is the four aggregates, starting with sensation
The meaning is that ignorance takes on the form of the five aggregates that are grasped onto
Among these, sensation is threefold
pleasurable, painful, and neutral
Perception is the internal description of things after apprehending their particular forms
The formations are the primary and subsidiary mental states that apprehend the particular circumstances of general things
The consciousnesses have already been described
Form has the nature of four elements
earth is characterized by heavines
water, by liquidity and fluidity
fire, by hea
wind, by its changing course, diffusiveness, and its being set into motion easily
From name and form arise six cognitive field
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and min
When combined with these six, ignorance sees and so forth, as explained previously
From these cognitive fields arises contac
meeting with forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, and the sphere of mentally cognized features
From contact arises craving, which is the desire for happiness
From craving arises grasping
From grasping arises becoming, which is entry into the womb
From becoming arises birth
This is the acquisition of the five perpetuating aggregates
death, which is the cessation of mind and its contents
Then, reflecting on old age and death, one becomes overcome with grief
One laments, ‘I have not striven for liberation.
Plagued by diseases, one is overcome by pain
Thinking about it again and again, one falls into depression
Even though one is already depressed, one is further assailed by misfortunes and becomes exasperated
The meaning is as follows
A being in the intermediate state after death possesses the full range of the six cognitive fields up to their furthest limit, which entails the fields governed by ignorance and so forth. Although remaining in just one place
that being will look at the three world
and see a woman and a man making love. Driven by the karma created in his previous lives, he will perceive the couple making love in a form that corresponds to his future form of existence
Upon seeing them, the meeting occurs with great intensity
At that point, if one is going to be a man, one sees oneself in the form of a man
One feels extreme passion for one’s future mothe
and is overcome by intense hatred for one’s future father
The passion and the hatred are sensations of pleasure and pain respectively
Then, out of great craving, which is impelled by the wind of one’s previous karma
one thinks, ‘Who is that man having sex with my woman?
Thinking this, one enters through the fontanel of one’s future father just like a falling star
Because one resides in the mind—the mind that abides in the father’s semen
At that point, one has become essentially identical to the semen
Because of being excited with great passion
one passes through the central channel and emerges from the father’s penis
Passing through the channel of the goddess of the Vajra Realm located in the orifice of the mother’s vulva, one is established in the birth channel of the womb
In due order, the stages of conceptus
embryonic nucleus
compacted matter, lump
and fetus with limbs unfold
and eventually one is born within nine or ten months, emerging through the same way that one entered
Thus a birth takes place
If, however, one is going to be a woman
one feels passion for the future fathe
and hatred for the future mother
One then sees oneself as having a female form
Entering through the fontanel of the future mother, one falls into the vagina
becomes fused with the semen, and remains in her birth channel
Then, in the same way as before, one emerges and is born
So in this way, people are born into the world through ignorance and the rest
And these people are only the five aggregates
These five aggregates circle unhappily around in saṃsāra
But those who seek liberatio
After the cessation of ignorance and the remaining links
the aggregates will also cease
it is the glorious lord Acala himself
form of the four joys
it abides in neither existence nor nirvāṇa
it is liberation
By knowing the meaning of Acala full
This concludes the chapter on dependent origination, sixteenth in the glorious tantra of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa called the Sole Hero
Then the Blessed Lady said
Lord, this sexual union Can increase and vitalize The semen, menstrual blood, penis, vagina, and breasts
As there are methods for bringing the woman’s mind to the state of enthrallment
For arresting the semen, and causing the menstrual blood to flo
And also for treating barrenness

The lord then said
Samāna in the navel area
Udāna in the area of the throat
And vyāna in the entire body
The most important among them i
The prāṇa, located in the heart
Through the cycle of breathing in and out
It sustains the life of all beings
With the system of sixteen saṃkrānti
Each breath is one daṇḍa in duration
With the passing of the four maṇḍalas
There are 
Breathing through the right nostril— This is called the maṇḍala of fire
Breathing through the left nostril— This is called the maṇḍala of wind
Breathing, equally, through the left and right nostrils— This is the maṇḍala of the earth
That same one, flowing gently
Is the maṇḍala of water
Lalanā is the left channel
Rasanā is positioned on the right
Avadhūtī is in the central area— It conducts prāṇa in the moment of innate joy
When the air enters, this is known as kumbhaka
When it is retained, this is called pūraka
When it is exhaled, this is known as recaka
When there is no movement, this is stambhaka
One should take Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa for the object of one’s absorptio
And begin the practice with a consort
One should keep track of air as it enters By counting breaths up to one hundred thousand or more

As Lord Buddha has explained
While tightly embracing the wisdom
He who counts the air by its unit
In the form of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
Will succeed within a fortnight
Endowed with divine knowledge
He will acquire the five superknowledges
And embracing one’s consort tightly
One should press at her heart with one’s heart, And unite one’s secret part with her secret part
Uniting the two mouths
Without thoughts and wholly devoted to bliss

A person will become omniscient
One will know the past, the future, and the present, And also the thoughts of others
I am telling the truth

One should cultivate the stillness inside the ears. One will be able to hear sounds from every place, As if they were nearby
Just so, having empowered the eyes
One will see far into the triple universe
Similarly, by focusing on the nose

Focusing, likewise, on the tongue
One will perceive distant tastes
And focusing on the tip of one’s sex organ

one will increase all one’s abilities
Pacifying, enriching, and enthralling
Likewise summoning, killing
And expelling—anything at all Will one accomplish through meditation alone
One should combine the practice of kumbhaka and so forth With the four gazes
Leftward gaze combined with kumbhaka Should effect enthralling
Rightward gaze, known as one that pulls in, Should be combined with pūraka
A gaze that rests on the forehead— The killing one—should be combined with recaka
A gaze that rests on the tip of the nos
When doing kumbhaka, one gazes at a distant flower
When doing pūraka, one gazes at a bush of common milk hedge
When doing recaka, one gazes at a resinous tree
When doing stambhaka, one gazes at swaying grass
One should allow six months for this practice of each In combination with the respective previously described gaze
Possessed of all abilities
one will be successful If one can arrest the movements of the mind
By arresting the mind, prāṇa is arrested
And by arresting the prāṇa, “The mind will become arrested
In the single union of wisdom and means, Which is the meeting of the vajra and the lotus
Through enjoying the pleasure with one’s mind arrested
The buddhas, Vajrasattva and so forth
What need then to mention worldly gods, The celebrated Śiva and so forth
The lord, the Acala of Reality, Is well concealed by me in all the tantras
Those who have honored hi
Have become buddhas, equal to the sky
Those of great magical powers Will be as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges
Endowed with buddha knowledge
Therefore a yogin should always Meditate regularly on Lord Acala
He who does not know Acala Will have a fruitless life
For without him, no success
Not even a small one, can be achieved

And is produced by the beings’ karma
By nature it is like a magical display
Similar to a city of gandharvas
It is the same as a rainbo
and said to be like the moon reflected in water
This concludes the chapter on the nature of the body, twenty-fourth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Then the goddess said
the arising of the perfection of wisdom‌
Please grant me this favor, my lord
Speak briefly, without elaborating too much
The lord then said
With the body of a sixteen-year-old
The goddess who sits in sattvaparyaṅka posture
She is blue, greatly exalted in merit
Crowned with Akṣobhya
In her raised right hand, she holds a red lotus
her left hand, which is in the playful attitude
She sits on a moon that rests on a lotus
One should meditate on this goddess While focused on the innate Acala
Arisen from the gnosis of the syllable hūṁ
As for the yoginī Viśvavajrī
One will surely attain success
Alternatively one should meditate on the white Sarasvatī, Arisen from the syllable dhīḥ
Or the red Kurukull
The goddess crowned with Amitābha And arisen from the gnosis of the syllable hrīṁ
Arisen from the gnosis of the syllable tāṁ
Or the green Tārā
Crowned with Amoghasiddhi
Should sit in the sattvaparyaṅka posture
Maintaining a gentle frame of mind
Holding a sword and a noose, full of splendor
Should find a girl from his own spiritual family or that of another, And meditate while holding her
Through this, there is no doubt That a yogin will succeed by means of a consort
Alternatively one should make a lifelike effigy And do practice with ‘her’—made of clay and so on
One should recite the mantra, with one-pointed mind. “And these are the respective mantras to be recited
‘Oṁ, Viśvavajrī, come, come! Hūṁ svāhā!
‘Oṁ, Vajrasarasvatī, come, come! Dhīḥ svāhā!
‘Oṁ, Vajra­dhātvīśvarī, come, come! Vaṁ svāhā!
‘Oṁ, Kurukullā, come, come! Hrīṁ svāhā!
‘Oṁ, Tārā, come, come! Tāṁ svāhā!
Now I will teach The maṇḍala of the Sole Hero
It has four corners, four doors
And is adorned with four gateways
It should be colored yellow
With a four-petaled lotus in the center
Its southeastern petal should be white
The southwestern red
The northwestern yellow
And the northeastern green
In the center, one should draw Acala of black color
Situated, optionally, on a sun disk
He could be white, yellow, red, or green. One should imagine him To be identical in nature with the five buddhas
In the southeast corner is Locanā
And has the radiance of the autumn moon
She holds, in her left and right hands, A moon and an aśoka twig
In the southwest is the supreme goddess Pāṇḍarā
In the northwest corner Is Māmak
With a vase and a bunch of rice twigs in her hands
In the northeast corner is green Tārā, Making a boon-granting gesture with her right han
And holding a blue lotus in her left
All of them have a seat of a moon disk And sit in the ardhaparyaṅka posture
One should place Passion Vajrī at the eastern gate, Standing on a seat fashioned from Indra
She holds a sword and a skull and is of red complexion
In the south, one should place the blue Hatred Vajrī; Holding a kartri knife, she makes a threatening gesture And stands on a seat fashioned from Yama
With a threatening gesture, Holding an aśoka twig
All are angry and have their hair hanging loose
The four yellow vases Should be placed in the corners
By merely visualizing him, One is provided with the company of eight yoginīs
Abiding in the three realms, one becomes The husband of all women, the supreme lord
Now I will teach another meditation on Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
In the center of a multicolored lotus, One should visualize the lord Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
the red Rāmadeva
The yellow Kāmadeva
The green vetāla by name of Māhill
They have a kartri knife and a skull cup in their hands
To the west of the lord Is the goddess Parṇaśāvarī
By meditating on just that an
offering grilled fish and so on
holding a white lotus in her left hand
Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, for his part, should be visualized as blue
The yogin, adept in meditation
Will succeed right at that time
In this way, one should meditate on The White Acala and so forth with firm application
Even without the seed syllable, one should meditate With one’s mind focused one-pointedly
Whether drinking, eating, sleeping
Standing, walking, or running
In whatever situation he may be, The yogin should visualize the divine form
Or he should cultivate only bliss, Savored while coupling with the yoginī
One should meditate deeply Until one attains mastery
When mastery is attained, The yogin will succeed through mahāmudra
This concludes the chapter on deity practice, twenty-fifth in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called the Sole Hero
Lord Vajrasattva spoke this tantra, an
the assemblies of yogins and yoginīs rejoiced at his words
This completes the tantra of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa called the Sole Hero
